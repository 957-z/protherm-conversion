        "abstract": "We report a native-state hydrogen-exchange (HX) method to simultaneously obtain both thermodynamic and kinetic information on the formation of multiple excited states in a folding energy landscape. Our method exploits the inherent dispersion and pH dependence of the intrinsic HX rates to cover both the EX2 (thermodynamic) and EX1 (kinetic) regimes. At each concentration of denaturant, HX measurements are performed over a range of pH values. Using this strategy, we dissected Borrelia burgdorferi OspA, a predominantly beta-sheet protein containing a unique single-layer beta-sheet, into five cooperative units and postulated excited states predominantly responsible for HX. More importantly, we determined the interconversion rates between these excited states and the native state. The use of both thermodynamic and kinetic information from native-state HX enabled us to construct a folding landscape of this 28kDa protein, including local minima and maxima, and to discriminate on-pathway and off-pathway intermediates. This method, which we term EX2/EX1 HX, should be a powerful tool for characterizing the complex folding mechanisms exhibited by the majority of proteins.",

        "abstract": "Anion exchanger 1 (AE1, Band 3) is the predominant membrane protein of erythrocytes. Its 52 kDa C-terminal domain functions as a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, while its 43 kDa N-terminal cytosolic domain (cdb3) anchors the cytoskeleton to the membrane. Several proteins bind to cdb3, including protein 4.2, a cytoskeletal protein. Three mutations in cdb3 are associated with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and decreased levels of protein 4.2 in erythrocytes. In this study, these cdb3 mutants (E40K, G130R, and P327R) were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. Sedimentation experiments showed that the wild-type and mutant proteins are dimers. No difference in secondary structure between mutant and wild-type proteins was detected using circular dichroism (CD) analysis. The wild-type and mutant proteins underwent similar pH-dependent conformational changes when monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Urea denaturation of proteins monitored by intrinsic fluorescence showed no significant differences in the sensitivity of the proteins to this chemical denaturant. Thermal denaturation monitored by CD and by calorimetry revealed that only the P327R mutant had a significantly lower midpoint of transition (approximately 5 degrees C) than the wild-type protein, suggesting a modest decrease in stability. The results show that the HS mutant cdb3 proteins do not differ to any great extent in structure from the wild-type protein, suggesting that the HS mutations may directly affect protein 4.2 binding.",

        "abstract": "The extremely halophilic Archae require near-saturating concentrations of salt in the external environment and in their cytoplasm, potassium being the predominant intracellular cation. The proteins of these organisms have evolved to function in concentrations of salt that inactivate or precipitate homologous proteins from non-halophilic species. It has been proposed that haloadaptation is primarily due to clustering of acidic residues on the surface of the protein, and that these clusters bind networks of hydrated ions. The dihydrofolate reductases from Escherichia coli (ecDHFR) and two DHFR isozymes from Haloferax volcanii (hvDHFR1 and hvDHFR2) have been used as a model system to compare the effect of salts on a mesophilic and halophilic enzyme. The KCl-dependence of the activity and substrate affinity was investigated. ecDHFR is largely inactivated above 1M KCl, with no major effect on substrate affinity. hvDHFR1 and hvDHFR2 unfold at KCl concentrations below approximately 0.5M. Above approximately 1M, the KCl dependence of the hvDHFR activities can be attributed to the effect of salt on substrate affinity. The abilities of NaCl, KCl, and CsCl to enhance the stability to urea denaturation were determined, and similar efficacies of stabilization were observed for all three DHFR variants. The DeltaG degrees (H(2)O) values increased linearly with increasing KCl and CsCl concentrations. The increase of DeltaG degrees (H(2)O) as a function of the smallest cation, NaCl, is slightly curved, suggesting a minor stabilization from cation binding or screening of electrostatic repulsion. At their respective physiological ionic strengths, the DHFR variants exhibit similar stabilities. Salts stabilize ecDHFR and the hvDHFRs by a common mechanism, not a halophile-specific mechanism, such as the binding of hydrated salt networks. The primary mode of salt stabilization of the mesophilic and halophilic DHFRs appears to be through preferential hydration and the Hofmeister effect of salt on the activity and entropy of the aqueous solvent. In support of this conclusion, all three DHFRs are similarly stabilized by the non-ionic cosolute, sucrose.",

        "abstract": "Computational design of proteins with altered ligand specificity is an emerging method for the creation of new biosensing systems. In this work, we investigated the outcome of site-directed mutagenesis on the Escherichia coli ribose binding protein (RBP), which is frequently used as a design scaffold for computational searches. A ribose biosensor was first constructed whereby an environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe was covalently attached to RBP at position S265C. This protein conjugate displayed a 54% decrease in emission intensity upon the addition of saturating ribose concentrations and exhibited an apparent dissociation constant (K(d) ) of 3.4 microM. Site-directed mutants within the RBP binding pocket were created and examined for ribose binding ability and overall structural stability. Because as many as 12 mutations are needed to alter ligand specificity in RBP, we measured the effect of single and multiple alanine mutations on stability and signal transduction potential of the ribose biosensor. Single alanine mutations had significant impact on both stability and signaling. Mutations of N190A and F214A each produced melting temperatures >8 degrees C below those observed for the wild-type protein. Residue Q235, located in the hinge region of RBP, appeared to be a hot spot for global protein stability as well. Additional single alanine mutations demonstrated as much as 200-fold increase in apparent K(d) but retained overall protein stability. The data collected from this study may be incorporated into design algorithms to help create more stable biosensors and optimize signal transduction properties for a variety of important analytes.",

        "abstract": "Detailed circular dichroism and fluorescence studies at different pHs have been carried out to monitor thermal unfolding of horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme c (HRPc). The change in CD in the 222 nm region corresponds to changes in the overall secondary structure of the enzyme, while that in the 400 nm region (Soret region) corresponds to changes in the tertiary structure around the heme in the enzyme. The temperature dependence of the tertiary structure around the heme also affected the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum of the enzyme. The results suggested that melting of the tertiary structure to a pre-molten globule form takes place at 45 degrees C, which is much lower than the temperature (T(m) = 74 degrees C) at which depletion of heme from the heme cavity takes place. The melting of the tertiary structure was found to be associated with a pK(a) of approximately 5, indicating that this phase possibly involves breaking of the hydrogen-bonding network of the heme pocket, keeping the heme moiety still inside it. The stability of the secondary structure of the enzyme was also found to decrease at pH below 4.5. A 'high temperature' unfolding phase was observed which was, however, independent of pH. The stability of the secondary structure was found to drastically decrease in the presence of DTT (dithiothreitol), indicating that the 'high temperature' form is possibly stabilized due to interhelical disulfide bonds. Depletion of Ca(2+) ions resulted in a marked decrease in the stability of the secondary structure of the enzyme.",

Nevertheless, one substitution of this type, the Tyr 26----Cys mutation in lambda Cro, increases the melting temperature of the protein by 11 degrees C and the stability by 2.2 kcal mol-1. Here we show that the stability of Cro can be increased by many different amino-acid substitutions at position 26, with increasing stability showing a good correlation with decreasing side-chain hydrophobicity. As Tyr 26 is hyper-exposed to solvent in the Cro crystal structure, we suggest that wild-type and variant proteins with other hydrophobic side chains at position 26 are destabilized as a result of a reverse hydrophobic effect caused by the side chain being more exposed to solvent in the native than in the denatured state.",

S., & Qian, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1134]. Circular dichroism measurements showed that all three dimers unfolded in cooperative reversible transitions with T1/2 = 40.0 degrees C and delta H degrees = 162 kcal/mol for alpha alpha and with T1/2 = 42.6 degrees C and delta H degree = 98 kcal/mol for beta beta at 0.4-0.5 microM concentrations. Fluorescence measurements on pyrenyliodoacetamide-labeled tropomyosin showed that (i) excimer fluorescence decreases in parallel with unfolding of homodimers, (ii) at physiological temperature, heterodimers are formed from micromolar mixtures of homodimers over a period of minutes, and (iii) heterodimers unfold/refold with temperature without appreciable formation of homodimers. To understand the preferential formation of alpha beta, we calculated the concentrations of all species present as a function of temperature for equal total amounts of alpha and beta, using the measured thermodynamic constants of the unfolding/dissociation equilibria for alpha alpha and beta beta. Values for delta H degrees = 225 kcal/mol and T1/2 = 43 degrees C for unfolding of alpha beta at 0.5 microM concentration were obtained from the best fit of the calculations to the measured helical content vs temperature of alpha beta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Classical protein folding invokes a cooperative transition between distinct thermodynamic states that are individually populated at equilibrium and separated by an energy barrier. It has been proposed, however, that the small protein, BBL, undergoes one-step downhill folding whereby it folds non-cooperatively to its native state without encountering an appreciable energy barrier. Only a single conformational ensemble is populated under given conditions, and so the denatured state ensemble progressively changes into the native structure. A wide dispersion of thermal denaturation midpoints that was observed for an extrinsically labelled fragment of BBL is proposed to be evidence for its one-state, downhill folding, a phenomenon that is also suggested to be functionally important for BBL and its homologues. We found, however, that thermal denaturation of unlabelled wild-type BBL was highly cooperative, with very similar transition midpoints for the melting of secondary and tertiary interactions, as well as for individual residues when monitored by NMR. Similar results were also observed for two other homologues, E3BD and POB. Further, the extrinsic fluorophores perturbed the unfolding energetics of labelled BBL, and complicated its equilibrium behaviour. One-step downhill folding may well occur for some proteins that do not have distinct folded states but not for BBL and its well-folded homologues.",

        "abstract": "Human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a homotetrameric enzyme which protects mitochondria against oxygen-mediated free radical damage. Within each subunit, both the N-terminal helical hairpin and C-terminal alpha/beta domains contribute ligands to the catalytic manganese site. Two identical four-helix bundles, symmetrically assembled from the N-terminal helical hairpins, form a novel tetrameric interface that stabilizes the active sites. The 2.5 A crystallographic structure of the naturally occurring polymorphic variant Ile58Thr MnSOD reveals that the helical hairpin mutation Thr58 causes two packing defects in each of the two four-helix bundles of the tetrameric interface. Similar mutations, expected to cause packing defects in the Cu,ZnSOD dimer interface, are associated with the degenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Ile58Thr MnSOD is primarily dimeric in solution and is significantly less thermostable than the normal enzyme, with decreases of 15 degrees C in the main melting temperature and 20 degrees C in the heat-inactivation temperature. Consequently, this mutant MnSOD is compromised at normal body temperatures: thermal inactivation, predicted from the decrease in thermal stability, occurs with a theoretical half-life of only 3.2 h at 37 degrees C (1.4 h at 41 degrees C), compared with 3.1 years for native MnSOD. This prediction is supported by direct measurements: incubation at 41.7 degrees C for 3 h has no effect on the activity of native MnSOD but completely inactivates mutant MnSOD. Rapid inactivation of Ile58Thr MnSOD at the elevated temperatures associated with fever and inflammation could provide an early advantage by killing infected cells, but also would increase superoxide-mediated oxidative damage and perhaps contribute to late-onset diseases.",

        "abstract": "The role of the secondary structure in the folding mechanism of dihydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli was probed by studying the effects of amino acid replacements in two alpha helices and two strands of the central beta sheet on the folding and stability. The effects on stability could be qualitatively understood in terms of the X-ray structure for the wild-type protein by invoking electrostatic, hydrophobic, or hydrogen-bonding interactions. Kinetic studies focused on the two slow reactions that are thought to reflect the unfolding/refolding of two stable native conformers to/from their respective folding intermediates [Touchette, N. A., Perry, K. M., & Matthews, C. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 5445-5452]. Replacements at three different positions in helix alpha B selectively alter the relaxation time for unfolding while a single replacement in helix alpha C selectively alters the relaxation time for refolding. This behavior is characteristic of mutations that change the stability of the protein but do not affect the rate-limiting step. In striking contrast, replacements in strands beta F and beta G can affect both unfolding and refolding relaxation times. This behavior shows that these mutations alter the rate-limiting step in these native-to-intermediate folding reactions. It is proposed that the intermediates have an incorrectly formed beta sheet whose maturation to the structure found in the native conformation is one of the slow steps in folding.",

The results confirm predictions that Hsp22 belongs to the family of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) with certain parts of its molecule (presumably, in the alpha-crystallin domain) retaining folded structure and undergoing reversible thermal unfolding.

Protein stability and conformation of MM-kappaI as a function of temperature or denaturant conditions at pH 7.4 and 4.8 were investigated. At pH 4.8, calorimetry demonstrated that MM-kappaI undergoes an incomplete, cooperative, partially reversible thermal unfolding with increased unfolding temperature and calorimetric enthalpy as compared to pH 7.4. Secondary and tertiary structural analyses provided evidence to support the presence of unfolding intermediates. Chemical denaturation resulted in more extensive protein unfolding. The stability of MM-kappaI was reduced and protein unfolding was irreversible at pH 4.8, thus suggesting that different pathways are utilized in thermal and chemical unfolding.",

We have used NMR spectroscopy and conformational stability studies to quantify changes in local and global free energy due to mutagenesis at Ser46, the N-cap for helix B in HPr. Previous NMR studies suggested that helix B of Escherichia coli HPr is dynamic as judged by the rate of exchange of amide protons with solvent. Ser46 was chosen because it is the site of regulatory phosphorylation in HPrs from Gram-positive bacteria, and mutation of this residue to an aspartic acid (S46D) in E. coli HPr (Gram-negative) also makes it a poor substrate in the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system. Therefore, to understand the mechanism of inactivation of E. coli S46D HPr, as well as the effect of mutagenesis on protein stability, we have characterized three mutants of E. coli HPr: Ser46 has been mutated to an Asp, Asn, and Ala in S46D, S46N, and S46A HPrs, respectively. The results indicate that these N-cap replacements have a marked influence on helix B stability. The effect of mutagenesis on local stability is correlated to global unfolding of HPr. The ability of amino acids to stabilize helix B is Asp > Asn > Ser > Ala. In addition, since there are neither large-scale conformational changes nor detectable changes in the active site of S46D HPr, it is proposed that the loss of phosphotransfer activity of S46D HPr is due to unfavorable steric and/or electrostatic interactions of the Asp with enzyme I of the PTS.",

We found that for both types of modification the stabilization effect can be correlated with the changes in protein surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity brought about by the modification. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the effects of these two types of modification on CT structure and its behavior in water-ethanol mixtures are different. Differential scanning calorimetry studies revealed that after modification two or three fractions or domains, differing in their stability, can be resolved.

The guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of isolated proteins was monitored by fluorescence measurements. The redox potentials, Eo', for both the folded and unfolded conformations have been measured. Free energy changes of chemical unfolding together with direct electrochemical measurement of the free energy changes of reduction for both the native and unfolded proteins yield a complete thermodynamic cycle, which includes four states of cytochrome c: oxidized folded, oxidized unfolded, reduced folded, and reduced unfolded. Completed cycles illustrate that the stability of cytochrome c to denaturing conditions is different for each amino acid substitution by an amount that depends on the heme oxidation state. Thus, the differential protein stability cannot be interpreted simply in terms of a hydrophobic effect, without also considering coupled Coulombic effects.",

A suitable guest position in the protein was identified, and its neighboring environment was modified to minimize the potential for artifactual interactions. All 20 amino acids were individually substituted at the guest site, and their effect on the protein's thermal stability was determined. NMR was used to verify the structural integrity of several of the proteins with different amino acid substitutions at the guest site. The results of these studies provide a thermodynamic scale for the relative beta-sheet forming propensities of the amino acids that shows a clear correlation with the beta-sheet preferences derived from statistical surveys of proteins of known structure.",

        "abstract": "A major goal of this paper was to estimate a dynamic range of equilibrium constant for the opening of a single peptide bond in a model protein, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). Ten mutants of BPTI containing a single Xaa-->Met substitution introduced in different parts of the molecule were expressed in Escherichia coli. The mutants were folded, purified to homogeneity, and cleaved with cyanogen bromide to respective cleaved forms. Conformation of the intact mutants was similar to the wildtype, as judged from their circular dichroism spectra. Substantial conformational changes were observed on the chemical cleavage of three single peptide bonds--Met46-Ser, Met49-Cys, and Met53-Thr--located within the C-terminal helix. Cleavage of those peptide bonds caused a significant destabilization of the molecule, with a drop of the denaturation temperature by 56.4 degrees C to 68 degrees C at pH 4.3. Opening of the remaining seven peptide bonds was related to a 10.8 degrees C to 39.4 degrees C decrease in T(den). Free energies of the opening of 10 single peptide bonds in native mutants (Delta G(op,N)) were estimated from the thermodynamic cycle that links denaturation and cleavage free energies. To calculate those values, we assumed that the free energy of opening of a single peptide bond in the denatured state (Delta G(op,D)) was equal to -2.7 kcal/mole, as reported previously. Calculated Delta G(op,N) values in BPTI were in the range from 0.2 to 10 kcal/mole, which was equivalent to a >1 million-fold difference in equilibrium constants. The values of Delta G(op,N) were the largest for peptide bonds located in the C-terminal helix and significantly lower for peptide bonds in the beta-structure or loop regions. It appears that opening constants for single peptide bonds in various proteins span across 33 orders of magnitude. Typical equilibrium values for a single peptide bond opening in a protein containing secondary structure elements fall into negligibly low values, from 10(-3) to 10(-8), and are efficient to ensure stability against proteolysis.",

        "abstract": "Anticoagulation factor I (ACF I) isolated from the venom of Agkistrodon acutus is an activated coagulation factor X-binding protein in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion with marked anticoagulant activity. The equilibrium unfolding/refolding of apo-ACF I, holo-ACF I, and Tb(3+)-reconstituted ACF I in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) solutions was studied by following the fluorescence and circular dichroism. Metal ions were found to increase the structural stability of ACF I against GdnHCl and thermal denaturation and, furthermore, influence its unfolding/refolding behavior. The GdnHCl-induced unfolding/refolding of both apo-ACF I and Tb(3+)-ACF I is a two-state process with no detectable intermediate state(s), whereas the GdnHCl-induced unfolding/refolding of holo-ACF I in the presence of 1 mM Ca(2+) follows a three-step transition, with intermediate state a (Ia) and intermediate state b (Ib). Ca(2+) ions play an important role in the stabilization of the Ia and Ib states. The decalcification of holo-ACF I shifts the ending zone of unfolding/refolding curve toward lower GdnHCl concentration, whereas the reconstitution of apo-ACF I with Tb(3+) ions shifts the initial zone of denaturation curve toward higher GdnHCl concentration. Therefore, it is possible to find a denaturant concentration (2.0 M GdnHCl) at which refolding from the fully denatured state of apo-ACF I to the Ib state of holo-ACF I or to the native state of Tb(3+)-ACF I can be initiated merely by adding the 1 mM Ca(2+) ions or 10 microM Tb(3+) ions to the unfolded state of apo-ACF I, respectively, without changing the concentration of the denaturant. Using Tb(3+) as a fluorescence probe of Ca(2+), the kinetic results of metal ions-induced refolding provide evidence that the compact Tb(3+)-binding region forms first, and subsequently, the protein undergoes further conformational rearrangements to form the native structure.",

        "abstract": "Eglin c from the leech Hirudo medicinalis is a potent protein inhibitor of many serine proteinases including chymotrypsin and subtilisins. Unlike most small protein inhibitors whose solvent-exposed enzyme-binding loop is stabilized primarily by disulfide bridges flanking the reactive-site peptide bond, eglin c possesses an enzyme-binding loop supported predominantly by extensive electrostatic/H-bonding interactions involving three Arg residues (Arg48, Arg51, and Arg53) projecting from the scaffold of the inhibitor. As an adjacent residue, the C-terminal Gly70 participates in these interactions via its alpha-carboxyl group interacting with the side chain of Arg51 and the main chain of Arg48. In addition, the amide NH group of Gly70 donates an H-bond to the carbonyl C=O groups of Arg48 and Arg51. To understand the structural and functional relevance of the electrostatic/H-bonding network, we chemically synthesized wild-type eglin c and three analogues in which Gly70 was either deleted or replaced by glycine amide (NH(2)CH(2)CONH(2)) or by alpha-hydroxylacetamide (HOCH(2)CONH(2)). NMR analysis indicated that the core structure of eglin c was maintained in the analogues, but that the binding loop was significantly perturbed. It was found that deletion or replacement of Gly70 destabilized eglin c by an average of 2.7 kcal/mol or 20 degrees C in melting temperature. As a result, these inhibitors become substrates for their target enzymes. Binding assays on these analogues with a catalytically incompetent subtilisin BPN' mutant indicated that loss or weakening of the interactions involving the carboxylate of Gly70 caused a decrease in binding by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. Notably, for all four synthetic inhibitors, the relative free energy changes (DeltaDeltaG) associated with protein destabilization are strongly correlated (slope = 0.94, r(2) = 0. 9996) with the DeltaDeltaG values derived from a decreased binding to the enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Most loss-of-function diseases are caused by aberrant folding of important proteins. These proteins often misfold due to mutations. The disease marble brain syndrome (MBS), known also as carbonic anhydrase II deficiency syndrome (CADS), can manifest in carriers of point mutations in the human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) gene. One mutation associated with MBS entails the His107Tyr substitution. Here, we demonstrate that this mutation is a remarkably destabilizing folding mutation. The loss-of-function is clearly a folding defect, since the mutant shows 64% of CO(2) hydration activity compared to that of the wild-type at low temperature where the mutant is folded. On the contrary, its stability towards thermal and guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) denaturation is highly compromised. Using activity assays, CD, fluorescence, NMR, cross-linking, aggregation measurements and molecular modeling, we have mapped the properties of this remarkable mutant. Loss of enzymatic activity had a midpoint temperature of denaturation (T(m)) of 16 degrees C for the mutant compared to 55 degrees C for the wild-type protein. GuHCl-denaturation (at 4 degrees C) showed that the native state of the mutant was destabilized by 9.2kcal/mol. The mutant unfolds through at least two equilibrium intermediates; one novel intermediate that we have termed the molten globule light state and, after further denaturation, the classical molten globule state is populated. Under physiological conditions (neutral pH; 37 degrees C), the His107Tyr mutant will populate the molten globule light state, likely due to novel interactions between Tyr107 and the surroundings of the critical residue Ser29 that destabilize the native conformation. This intermediate binds the hydrophobic dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) but not as strong as the molten globule state, and near-UV CD reveals the presence of significant tertiary structure. Notably, this intermediate is not as prone to aggregation as the classical molten globule. As a proof of concept for an intervention strategy with small molecules, we showed that binding of the CA inhibitor acetazolamide increases the stability of the native state of the mutant by 2.9kcal/mol in accordance with its strong affinity. Acetazolamide shifts the T(m) to 34 degrees C that protects from misfolding and will enable a substantial fraction of the enzyme pool to survive physiological conditions.",

The temperature of barnase melting in its complex with barstar is 20 degrees C higher than that of the free enzyme. The barstar melting temperature is almost the same in the complex or alone (71 degrees C at pH 6.2 and 68 degrees C at pH 8.0).

        "abstract": "This paper shows that the position and shape of the denaturation endothem of collagen fibrils are governed by the kinetics of an irreversible rate process. This was proved by measuring the rate of denaturation in rat tail tendons held isothermally at different temperatures, thereby determining rate constant characteristics such as the activation enthalpy and entropy and predicting endotherm position and shape therefrom. Comparison with actual scanning results showed good correspondence. Isothermal measurements of the rate of collagen denaturation, measured continuously using a calorimetric method, were used to determine rate constants for collagen denaturation in tendons immersed in water and 0.5 M acetic acid. The temperature dependence of the rate constants were fitted to the three rate process models, previously examined theoretically: the D and z formulation, the Arrhenius equation and the absolute rate theory. For example, in water the activation enthalpy was 0.518 (+/- 0.016) Mj mol-1 and the activation entropy 1.485 (+/- 0.049) kj mol-1 K-1, while in acetic acid the corresponding figures were 1.306 (+/- 0.099) Mj mol-1 and 4.142 (+/- 0.323) kj mol-1 K-1. These characteristics are discussed in terms of the thermal activation of a region of the molecule, the co-operative unit. The ratio of the activation enthalpy to the calorimetry enthalpy of denaturation indicated a co-operative unit that was 66 (+/- 5) residues long when fibrils were swollen in acetic and the collagen molecules acted essentially independently. On the other hand the intact fibrils in water gave a co-operative unit of 26 (+/- 1) residues long. The reason for the reduction in size of the co-operative unit is that it is surrounded, and therefore stabilized by other molecules in the fibre. It is interesting to note that the suggested co-operative unit lies almost entirely within the \"gap\" zone of the collagen fibril in its quarter-staggered arrangement of molecules. We believe that the co-operative unit would be represented by a domain that is free of stabilising hydroxyproline residues. Indeed such a domain exists near the C terminus of the triple helix from Gly877 to Pro941, i.e. 65 residues. In acetic acid, activation is similar to that of collagen molecules in solution. All the inter alpha-chain hydrogen bonds in the co-operative unit are broken and the separate chains in this short region are free to flail around under the action of thermal collisions relatively unimpeded by intermolecular interactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "To quantitate the contributions of the large hydrophobic residues in staphylococcal nuclease to the stability of its native state, single alanine and glycine substitutions were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis for each of the 11 leucine, 9 valine, 7 tyrosine, 5 isoleucine, 4 methionine, and 3 phenylalanine residues. In addition, each isoleucine was also mutated to valine. The resulting collection of 83 mutant nucleases was submitted to guanidine hydrochloride denaturation using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to monitor the equilibrium constant between the native and denatured states. From analysis of these data, each mutant protein's stability to reversible denaturation (delta GH2O) and sensitivity to guanidine hydrochloride (mGuHCl or d(delta G)/d[GuHCl]) were obtained. Four unexpected trends were observed. (1) A striking bipartite distribution was found for sites of mutations that altered mGuHCl: mutations that increased this parameter only involved residues that contribute side chains to the major hydrophobic core centered around a five-strand beta-barrel, whereas mutations that caused mGuHCl to decrease clustered around a second, smaller and less well-defined hydrophobic core. (2) The average stability loss for mutants in each of the six residue classes was 2-3 times greater than that estimated on the basis of the free energy of transfer of the hydrophobic side chain from water to n-octanol. (3) The magnitude of the stability loss on substituting Ala or Gly for a particular type of amino acid varied extensively among the different sites of its occurrence in nuclease, indicating that the environment surrounding a specific residue determines how large a stability contribution its side chain will make.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

J. 66:516-523) we reported the development of a modified spectrophotometer that can make nearly simultaneous circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence measurements. This arrangement allows multiple data sets to be collected during a single experiment, resulting in a saving of time and material, and improved correlation between the different types of measurements. The usefulness of the instrument was shown by thermal melting experiments on several different protein systems. This CD/fluorometer spectrophotometer has been further modified by interfacing with a syringe pump and a pH meter. This arrangement allows ligand, pH, and chemical denaturation titration experiments to be performed while monitoring changes in the sample's CD, absorbance, fluorescence, and light scattering properties. Our data acquisition program also has an ability to check whether the signals have approached equilibrium before the data is recorded. For performing pH titrations we have developed a procedure which uses the signal from a pH meter in a feedback circuit in order to collect data at evenly spaced pH intervals. We demonstrate the use of this instrument with studies of the unfolding of sperm whale apomyoglobin, as induced by acid pH and by the addition of guanidine-HCI.",

        "abstract": "The urea-induced equilibrium unfolding transition of dihydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli was monitored by UV difference, circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. Each of these data sets were well described by a two-state unfolding model involving only native and unfolded forms. The free energy of folding in the absence of urea at pH 7.8, 15 degrees C is 6.13 +/- 0.36 kcal mol-1 by difference UV, 5.32 +/- 0.67 kcal mol-1 by CD, and 5.42 +/- 1.04 kcal mol-1 by fluorescence spectroscopy. The midpoints for the difference UV, CD, and fluorescence transitions are 3.12, 3.08, and 3.18 M urea, respectively. The near-coincidence of the unfolding transitions monitored by these three techniques also supports the assignment of a two-state model for the equilibrium results. Kinetic studies of the unfolding and refolding reactions show that the process is complex and therefore that additional species must be present. Unfolding jumps in the absence of potassium chloride revealed two slow phases which account for all of the amplitude predicted by equilibrium experiments. Unfolding in the presence of 400 mM KCl results in the selective loss of the slower phase, implying that there are two native forms present in equilibrium prior to unfolding. Five reactions were observed in refolding: two slow phases designated tau 1 and tau 2 that correspond to the slow phases in unfolding and three faster reactions designated tau 3, tau 4, and tau 5 that were followed by stopped-flow techniques. The kinetics of the recovery of the native form was monitored by following the binding of methotrexate, a tight-binding inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, at 380 nm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The two proteins vary in sequence at 12 positions but only two of them, Arg3 and Leu66 of Bc-Csp, which replace Glu3 and Glu66 of Bs-CspB, are responsible for the additional stability of Bc-Csp. These two positions are near the ends of the protein chain, but close to each other in the three-dimensional structure. The Glu3Arg exchange alone changed the stability by more than 11 kJ mol(-1). Here, we elucidated the molecular origins of the stability difference between the two proteins by a mutational analysis. Electrostatic contributions to stability were characterized by measuring the thermodynamic stabilities of many variants as a function of salt concentration. Double and triple mutant analyses indicate that the stabilization by the Glu3Arg exchange originates from three sources. Improved hydrophobic interactions of the aliphatic moiety of Arg3 contribute about 4 kJ mol(-1). Another 4 kJ mol(-1) is gained from the relief of a pairwise electrostatic repulsion between Glu3 and Glu66, as in the mesophilic protein, and 3 kJ mol(-1) originate from a general electrostatic stabilization by the positive charge of Arg3, which is not caused by a pairwise interaction. Mutations of all potential partners for an ion pair within a radius of 10 A around Arg3 had only marginal effects on stability. The Glu3-->Arg3 charge reversal thus optimizes ionic interactions at the protein surface by both local and global effects. However, it cannot convert the coulombic repulsion with another Glu residue into a corresponding attraction. Avoidance of unfavorable coulombic repulsions is probably a much simpler route to thermostability than the creation of stabilizing surface ion pairs, which can form only at the expense of conformational entropy.",

The triple warm spot mutation generates a DeltaDeltaG(D) = 5.11 +/- 0.06 kcal/mol versus DeltaDeltaG(D) = 2.52 +/- 0.22 kcal/mol for the sum of the three individuals. The non-additivity in the individual DeltaDeltaG(D) values for the alanine mutations may indicate that these residues provide a conformationally stabilizing effect on the hot spot residues, each of which exhibits DeltaDeltaG(D) > 4.0 kcal/mol on alanine substitution.",

        "abstract": "Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (ArATPh), which has a melting temperature of 120 degrees C, is one of the most thermostable aminotransferases yet to be discovered. The crystal structure of this aminotransferase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii was determined to a resolution of 2.1 A. ArATPh has a homodimer structure in which each subunit is composed of two domains, in a manner similar to other well characterized aminotransferases. By the least square fit after superposing on a mesophilic ArAT, the ArATPh molecule exhibits a large deviation of the main chain coordinates, three shortened alpha-helices, an elongated loop connecting two domains, and a long loop transformed from an alpha-helix, which are all factors that are likely to contribute to its hyperthermostability. The pyridine ring of the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate covalently binding to Lys(233) is stacked parallel to F121 on one side and interacts with the geminal dimethyl-CH/pi groups of Val(201) on the other side. This tight stacking against the pyridine ring probably contributes to the hyperthermostability of ArATPh. Compared with other ArATs, ArATPh has a novel substrate specificity, the order of preference being Tyr > Phe > Glu > Trp > His> Met > Leu > Asp > Asn. Its relatively weak activity against Asp is due to lack of an arginine residue corresponding to Arg(292)* (where the asterisk indicates that this is a residues supplied by the other subunit of the dimer) in pig cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase. The enzyme recognizes the aromatic substrate by hydrophobic interaction with aromatic rings (Phe(121) and Tyr(59)*) and probably recognizes acidic substrates by a hydrophilic interaction involving a hydrogen bond network with Thr(264)*.",

        "abstract": "To test the occurrence of local particularities during the unfolding of Ca2+-loaded goat alpha-lactalbumin (GLA) we replaced Trp60 and -118, either one or both, by Phe. In contrast with alternative studies, our recombinant alpha-lactalbumins are expressed in Pichia pastoris and do not contain the extra N-terminal methionine. The substitution of Trp60 leads to a reduction of the global stability. The effect of the Trp118Phe substitution on the conformation and stability of the mutant, however, is negligible. Comparison of the fluorescence spectra of these mutants makes clear that Trp60 and -118 are strongly quenched in the native state. They both contribute to the quenching of Trp26 and -104 emission. By the interplay of these quenching effects, the fluorescence intensity changes upon thermal unfolding of the mutants behave very differently. This is the reason for a discrepancy of the apparent transition temperatures derived from the shift of the emission maxima (Tm,Fl lambda) and those derived from DSC (Tm,DSC). However, the transition temperatures derived from fluorescence intensity (Tm,Fl int) and from DSC (Tm,DSC), respectively, are quite similar, and thus, no local rearrangements are observed upon heat-induced unfolding. At room temperature, the occurrence of specific local rearrangements upon GdnHCl-induced denaturation of the different mutants is deduced from the apparent free energies of their transition state obtained from stopped-flow fluorescence measurements. By phi-value analysis it appears that, while the surroundings of Trp118 are exposed in the kinetic transition state, the surroundings of Trp60 remain native.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the contribution of the amino acid residues on the surface of a protein to its stability, a series of hydrophobic mutant human lysozymes (Val to Gly, Ala, Leu, Ile, Met, and Phe) modified at three different positions on the surface, which are located in the alpha-helix (Val 110), the beta-sheet (Val 2), and the loop (Val 74), were constructed. Their thermodynamic parameters of denaturation and crystal structures were examined by calorimetry and by X-ray crystallography at 100 K, respectively. Differences in the denaturation Gibbs energy change between the wild-type and the hydrophobic mutant proteins ranged from 4.6 to -9.6 kJ/mol, 2.7 to -1.5 kJ/mol, and 3.6 to -0.2 kJ/mol at positions 2, 74, and 110, respectively. The identical substitution at different positions and different substitutions at the same position resulted in different degrees of stabilization. Changes in the stability of the mutant proteins could be evaluated by a unique equation considering the conformational changes due to the substitutions [Funahashi et al. (1999) Protein Eng. 12, 841-850]. For this calculation, secondary structural propensities were newly considered. However, some mutant proteins were not adapted to the equation. The hydration structures around the mutation sites of the exceptional mutant proteins were affected due to the substitutions. The stability changes in the exceptional mutant proteins could be explained by the formation or destruction of the hydration structures. These results suggest that the hydration structure mediated via hydrogen bonds covering the protein surface plays an important role in the conformational stability of the protein.",

        "abstract": "Under strongly denaturing conditions, the logarithm of the rate constant for dissociation/unfolding of the wild-type Arc dimer varies in a nonlinear fashion with denaturant concentration. To assess the unfolding/dissociation behavior under conditions favoring the native structure, we mixed Arc variants labeled with fluorescence acceptor or donor groups and used energy transfer to monitor the increase in heterodimer with time. Under the conditions of this experiment, the rate at which the heterodimer concentration approaches its equilibrium value is determined by rate of dissociation and unfolding of the protein. Using this method and traditional denaturant-jump experiments, rate constants for unfolding/dissociation were determined over a wide range of stabilizing and destabilizing conditions. In each case examined, plots of log(ku) versus denaturant showed significant curvature under strongly denaturing conditions, even though other kinetic experiments indicates that the unfolding/dissociation reactions remain largely two-state. This curvature can be explained most readily by a series of unstable intermediates in the unfolding pathway, with denaturant-induced changes in the kinetic step that is rate-limiting. Alternatively, curvature might result from Hammond behavior in which the structure of the transition state becomes more native-like as the stability of native Arc decreases with increasing denaturant.",

An equilibrium intermediate populates at moderate denaturant concentrations, and its CD spectrum is similar to that of the molten globule state previously observed for this protein at acid pH [Ikeguchi, M., Kato, S., Shimizu, A., and Sugai, S.

A significant change in the CD intensity was observed within the dead time of measurements (25 ms) when the refolding reaction was initiated by diluting the urea-unfolded protein solution, indicating the transient accumulation of the folding intermediate. The CD spectrum of this burst-phase intermediate agrees well with that of the molten globule state at acid pH. The stability of the burst-phase intermediate was also estimated from the urea-concentration dependence of the burst-phase amplitude, and it shows a fair agreement with that of the equilibrium intermediate. These results indicate that the molten globule state of equine beta-lactoglobulin populates at moderate urea concentration as well as at acid pH and it is equivalent with the kinetic folding intermediate.",

        "abstract": "The coiled coil is an attractive target for protein design. The helices of coiled coils are characterized by a heptad repeat of residues denoted a to g. Residues at positions a and d form the interhelical interface and are usually hydrophobic. An established strategy to confer structural uniqueness to two-stranded coiled coils is the use of buried polar Asn residues at position a, which imparts dimerization and conformational specificity at the expense of stability. Here we show that polar interactions involving buried position-a Lys residues that can interact favorably only with surface e' or g' Glu residues also impart structural uniqueness to a designed heterodimeric coiled coil with the nativelike properties of sigmoidal thermal and urea-induced unfolding transitions, slow hydrogen exchange and lack of ANS binding. The position-a Lys residues do not, however, confer a single preference for helix orientation, likely reflecting the ability of Lys at position a to from favorable interactions with g' or e' Glu residues in the parallel and antiparallel orientations, respectively. The Lys-Glu polar interaction is less destabilizing than the Asn-Asn a-->a' interaction, presumably reflecting a higher desolvation penalty associated with the completely buried polar position-a groups. Our results extend the range of approaches for two-stranded coiled-coil design and illustrate the role of complementing polar groups associated with buried and surface positions of proteins in protein folding and design.",

        "abstract": "Peanut agglutinin is a homotetrameric legume lectin. The crystal structure of peanut agglutinin shows that the four subunits associate in an unusual manner, giving rise to open quaternary structure [Banarjee, R., et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91, 227-231]. The thermal unfolding of peanut agglutinin has been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and gel filtration to elucidate its thermal stability and its mode of oligomerization. The unfolding process is reversible and could be described by a three-state model with two transitions occurring at around 331 and 336 K. For the tetramer, the ratio of DeltaHc/DeltaHv for the first transition is close to 4 and for the second transition is close to 0.25, suggesting that 4 and 0.25 cooperative unit(s) of the tetramer are involved in the first and second transitions, respectively. The agreement between the model-independent DeltaHv(S) determined from the values of the temperatures of the peak maximum (Tp1) with the protein concentration with the values of DeltaHv obtained from the fit of the data to the transition confirms that the first peak is associated with the dissociation of peanut agglutinin tetramers (A4) to \"folded\" monomers (4A), whereas the second peak describes the unfolding (4U) of these monomers. The overall process for the thermal unfolding of peanut agglutinin could therefore be summarized as A4 <==> 4A <==> 4U. Gel filtration studies confirm this process, as peanut agglutinin elutes as a tetramer up to 50 degrees C, and at and above 56 degrees C (Tm of first transition), it elutes at a position commensurate with that of the folded monomer of peanut agglutinin. The unfolding behavior of peanut agglutinin in the presence of saturating amounts of carbohydrate ligands is similar to that observed for the unligated form. The temperature of maximal stability of the peanut agglutinin tetramer at pH 7.4 is calculated to be around 33 degrees C with a maximal free energy of stabilization of 8.70 kcal/mol. The results demonstrate that unfolding of peanut agglutinin goes through two distinct phases with folded monomer being the intermediate.",

        "abstract": "Urea-induced denaturations of RNase T1 and reduced and carboxyamidated RNase T1 (RTCAM) as a function of temperature were analyzed using the linear extrapolation method, and denaturation m values, deltaCp, deltaH, deltaS, and deltaG quantities were determined. Because both deltaCp and m values are believed to reflect the protein surface area newly exposed on denaturation, the prediction is that the ratio of m values for RNase T1 and RTCAM should equal the deltaCp ratio for the two proteins. This is not the case, for it is found that the m value of RTCAM is 1.5 times that of RNase T1, while the denaturation deltaCp's for the two proteins are identical. The paradox of why the two parameters, m and deltaCp, are not equivalent in their behavior is of importance in the interpretations of their respective molecular-level meanings. It is found that the measured denaturation deltaCp's are consistent with deltaCp's calculated on the basis of empirical relationships between the change in surface area on denaturation (deltaASA), and that the measured m value of RNase T1 agrees with m calculated from empirical data relating m to deltaASA. However, the measured m of RTCAM is so much out of line with its calculated m as to call into question the validity of always equating m with surface area newly exposed on denaturation.",

In order to understand the role of the disulfide bond, a derivative in which the disulfide bond is replaced by an S-Hg-S bond was prepared and its conformation and stability were studied. The derivative was prepared by reacting the reduced CL fragment with mercuric chloride. Kinetic studies showed that the reaction is rate-limited by the unfolding process of the reduced CL fragment. The mercury derivative was as compact as the intact CL or reduced CL fragment, and a tryptophyl residue was found to be buried near the S-Hg-S bond in the interior of the protein molecule. Judging from the circular dichroic spectrum, however, the beta-structure characteristic of the immunoglobulin fold was disturbed. The stability of the derivative to guanidine hydrochloride was lower than that of the intact CL fragment, but the unfolding transition was reversible and cooperative. Decreased stability of the mercury derivative is due to its folded conformation being distorted by introduction of the S-Hg-S bond.",

All residue combinations that have been identified in naturally occurring cytochrome c sequences are found in the libraries. Mutants with these combinations are biologically functional. Enthalpies, heat capacities, and midpoint temperatures of denaturation are used to determine the entropy and Gibbs free energy of denaturation (delta GD) for the ferri form of the wild-type protein and 13 interface variants. Changes in delta GD cannot be allocated solely to enthalpic or entropic effects, but there is no evidence of enthalpy-entropy compensation. The lack of additivity of delta GD values for single versus multiple amino acid substitutions indicates that the helices interact thermodynamically. Changes in delta GD are not in accord with helix propensities, indicating that interactions between the helices and the rest of the protein outweigh helix propensity. Comparison of delta GD values for the interface variants and nearly 90 non-cytochrome c variants to side-chain model data leads to several conclusions. First, hydrocarbon side chains react to burial-like transfer from water to cyclohexane, but even weakly polar side chains respond differently. Second, despite octanol being a poor model for protein interiors, octanol-to-water transfer free energies are useful stability predictors for changing large hydrocarbon side chains to smaller ones. Third, unlike cyclohexane and octanol, the Dayhoff mutation matrix predicts stability changes for a variety of substitutions, even at interacting sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The assignment of the slowly exchanging imino proton resonances to the tryptophan residues (Trp26 and Trp60) was obtained by comparison of the nuclear Overhauser effect difference spectra of bovine, guinea pig, and human alpha-lactalbumin. Taking account of the thermal unfolding of each alpha-lactalbumin, the hydrogen exchange rates of the individual tryptophan residues are analyzed. The temperature dependence of the exchange rates classified their exchange mechanisms into two exchange processes: the \"low activation energy process\" and the \"high activation energy process\" which is associated directly with the global thermal unfolding of the protein. Trp26 of alpha-lactalbumin exchanges through the high activation energy process. The exchange behavior of Trp26 of guinea pig alpha-lactalbumin suggests a difference of the globally unfolded state of the protein from the other species. The exchange mechanism of Trp60 of human alpha-lactalbumin is the low activation energy process in contrast with those of the bovine and goat proteins, although their global thermodynamic properties are similar to each other. Trp104 and Trp118 of alpha-lactalbumin exchange through the low activation energy process, and the reaction rates are affected by the local structural differences around the tryptophan residues among these proteins. The results presented in this paper indicate that the hydrogen exchange rate through the low activation energy process provides the information only about the local nature of a protein while that through the high activation energy process provides the information about the global nature of a protein.",

Circular dichroism and fluorescence also were used to resolve the controversial issue of the quaternary structure of alpha-crystallin. Based on the thermal behavior as monitored by these techniques, a model is proposed that can account for all previous data as well as the currently reported thermal data. The proposed model of native alpha-crystallin has a three-layer structure in which the inner layer (core) is a micelle containing 12 subunits arranged in cuboctahedral symmetry. The apolar region is directed inward constituting a hydrophobic core similar to a micelle and adding structural stability. A second layer of six subunits has a similar but not identical structure to the first layer, directing its apolar face toward the hydrophobic core. Thus, these two layers constitute a micelle-like structure with octahedral symmetry. The third layer adds more subunits for a total of not more than 24. Differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, and fluorescence studies indicated that the inner two-layer structure of molecular mass 360 kDa is highly stable and is most likely of the alpha m form. The three-layer structure of the native protein, however, is rather unstable. At 35-45 degrees C the outer layer dissociates from the inner two layers, and at higher temperatures rapidly reassociates to a slightly modified two-layer structure with a stability similar to that of alpha m. The proposed model does not require any specific assembly of the alpha A and alpha B subunits in each layer, but the fluorescence results suggest that the native inner two layers probably contain mostly alpha A.",

The linear free energy model has been used to determine the excess changes in free energy, enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity that occur on denaturation. The stability of barstar in water decreases as the temperature is decreased from 300 to 273 K. This decrease in stability is not accompanied by a change in structure as monitored by measurement of the mean residue ellipticities at both 222 and 275 nm. When GdnHCl is present at concentrations between 1.2 and 2.0 M, the decrease in stability with decrease in temperature is however so large that the protein undergoes cold denaturation. The structural transition accompanying the cold denaturation process has been monitored by measuring the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. The temperature dependence of the change in free energy, obtained in the presence of 10 different concentrations of GdnHCl in the range 0.2-2.0 M, shows a decrease in stability with a decrease as well as an increase in temperature from 300 K. Values of the thermodynamic parameters governing the cold and the heart denaturation of barstar have been obtained with high precision by analysis of these bell-shaped stability curves. The change in heat capacity accompanying the unfolding reaction, delta Cp, has a value of 1460 +/- 70 cal mol-1 K-1 in water. The dependencies of the changes in enthalpy, entropy, free energy, and heat capacity on GdnHCl concentration have been analyzed on the basis of the linear free energy model. The changes in enthalpy (delta Hi) and entropy (delta Si), which occur on preferential binding of GdnHCl to the unfolded state, vis-a-vis the folded state, both have a negative value at low temperatures. With an increase in temperature delta Hi makes a less favorable contribution, while delta Si makes a more favorable contribution to the change in free energy (delta Gi) due to this interaction. The change in heat capacity (delta CPi) that occurs on preferential interaction of GdnHCl with the unfolded form has a value of only 53 +/- 36 cal mol-1 K-1 M-1.

We argue that initial microunfolding of their least stable domains would trigger self-assembly of fibers where the helices are protected from complete unfolding. Our data support an earlier hypothesis that in fibers collagen helices may melt and refold locally when needed, giving fibers their strength and elasticity. Apparently, Nature adjusts collagen hydroxyproline content to ensure that the melting temperature of triple helical monomers is several degrees below rather than above body temperature.",

        "abstract": "We report steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence studies with the single tryptophan protein, Staphylococcus aureus A, and several of its site-directed mutants. A couple of these mutants, nuclease-conA and nuclease-conA-S28G (which are hybrid proteins containing a six amino acid beta-turn substitute from concanavalin A), are found to have a much lower thermodynamic stability than the wild type. The thermal transition temperatures for nuclease-conA and S28G are 32.8 and 30.5 degrees C, which are about 20 degrees C lower than the Tm for wild-type nuclease A. These mutant proteins also are denatured by a much lower concentration of the denaturants urea and guanidine hydrochloride. We also show that an unfolding transition in the structure of the nuclease-conA hybrids can be induced by relatively low hydrostatic pressure (approximately 700 bar). The free energy for unfolding of nuclease-conA (and nuclease-conA-S28G) is found to be only 1.4 kcal/mol (and 1.2 kcal/mol) by thermal, urea, guanidine hydrochloride, and pressure unfolding. Time-resolved fluorescence intensity and anisotropy measurements with nuclease-conA-S28G show the temperature-, urea-, and pressure-perturbed states each to have a reduced average intensity decay time and to depolarize with a rotational correlation time of approximately 1.0 ns (as compared to a rotational correlation time of 11 ns for the native form of nuclease-conA-S28G at 20 degrees C).",

At low pH, the addition of specific polyanionic ligands or moderate amounts of salts induces states with high secondary but low tertiary structure content. At neutral pH, intermediate amounts of chaotropic agents impose similar partially structured conformational states which also display noncooperative unfolding transitions. Kinetic evidence indicates that similar forms of the protein exist in the first few hundred milliseconds in the refolding pathway of aFGF. The kinetics of their formation appear to be temperature-independent, implying lack of an energy barrier, which is characteristic for further slow folding into the native state. Unlike the native and fully unfolded states, these partially structured conformations exhibit very low solubility, resulting in irreversible aggregation. Potential physiological implications of the existence of such \"molten globule\" states with regard to the growth factor's transport and biological activity are considered.",

        "abstract": "Human gammaD-crystallin (HgammaD-Crys) is a monomeric eye lens protein composed of two highly homologous beta-sheet domains. The domains interact through interdomain side chain contacts forming two structurally distinct regions, a central hydrophobic cluster and peripheral residues. The hydrophobic cluster contains Met43, Phe56, and Ile81 from the N-terminal domain (N-td) and Val132, Leu145, and Val170 from the C-terminal domain (C-td). Equilibrium unfolding/refolding of wild-type HgammaD-Crys in guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) was best fit to a three-state model with transition midpoints of 2.2 and 2.8 M GuHCl. The two transitions likely corresponded to sequential unfolding/refolding of the N-td and the C-td. Previous kinetic experiments revealed that the C-td refolds more rapidly than the N-td. We constructed alanine substitutions of the hydrophobic interface residues to analyze their roles in folding and stability. After purification from E. coli, all mutant proteins adopted a native-like structure similar to wild type. The mutants F56A, I81A, V132A, and L145A had a destabilized N-td, causing greater population of the single folded domain intermediate. Compared to wild type, these mutants also had reduced rates for productive refolding of the N-td but not the C-td. These data suggest a refolding pathway where the domain interface residues of the refolded C-td act as a nucleating center for refolding of the N-td. Specificity of domain interface interactions is likely important for preventing incorrect associations in the high protein concentrations of the lens nucleus.",

Single tryptophan residues, substituted into the peptide at various positions by site-directed mutagenesis, were employed as fluorescent probes of local unfolding. Unfolding profiles for specific sites within the peptide were obtained by quantifying the shifts in the fluorescence emission maxima of single tryptophan residues on unfolding and plotting them against urea concentration. Unfolding reported by tryptophan residues in the C-terminal region was not characteristic of complete peptide denaturation, as evidenced by the relatively blue-shifted values of the fluorescence emission maxima. Unfolding was also monitored by using CD spectroscopy and the fluorescent probe 2-(p-toluidinyl)-naphthalene 6-sulphonic acid; the results indicated that unfolding of helices is concomitant with the exposure of protein non-polar surface. Unfolding profiles were evaluated by non-linear least-squares curve fitting and calculation of the unfolding transition midpoint. The unfolding profiles of residues located in the N-terminal region of the peptide had lower transition midpoints than residues in the C-terminal portion. The results of unfolding analysis demonstrated that urea unfolds the peptide only partly to an intermediate state, because the C-terminal portion of the channel peptide retained significant structure in 8.5 M urea. Characterization of the peptide's global unfolding by size-exclusion HPLC revealed that the partly denatured structure that persists in 8.5 M urea is a dimer of two channel peptides, tightly associated by hydrophobic interactions. The presence of the dimerized species was confirmed by SDS/PAGE and intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer.",

The changes in stability due to substitutions showed a linear correlation with changes in hydrophobicity of substituted residues, having different slopes at each mutation site. However, the stability of each mutant was found to be represented by a unique equation involving physical properties calculated from mutant structures. By fitting present and previous stability data for mutant human lysozymes substituted at various positions to the equation, the magnitudes of the hydrophobicity of a carbon atom and the hydrophobicity of nitrogen and neutral oxygen atoms were found to be 0.178 and -0.013 kJ/mol.A(2), respectively.

Chemical and thermal unfolding curves of ligand-free trypsinogen at pH 5.8 are cooperative and yielded the following stability parameters: the free energy change of denaturation delta Gden = 44.8 kJ/mol, the denaturation temperature = 65.7 degrees C, the enthalpy change of denaturation delta Hden at the denaturation temperature Tden = 607 kJ/mol and the heat capacity change of denaturation delta Cp,den = 12.4 kJ.mol-1.K-1. Fast phases of both unfolding and refolding of trypsinogen proceed on a time scale of seconds and fit to a single exponential. At pH 5.8, the calcium ion increases the conformational stability delta Gden by 7.1 kJ/mol, Tden by 2.6 K and delta Hden by 80 kJ/mol, but does not induce any substantial structural change in the trypsinogen molecule, as revealed by 1H-NMR spectra. The trypsin-like form of trypsinogen, generated by complexation of the zymogen with the dipeptide Ile-Val and/or basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz), is characterized by increase of delta Hden by 134 kJ/mol and Tden by 2.5 K, which may be attributed to the additional energy required to disrupt the rigidified activation domain in the complexed trypsinogen.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the pH dependence of the conformational stability of ribonucleases A and T1, urea and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curves have been determined over the pH range 2-10. The maximum conformational stability of both proteins is about 9 kcal/mol and occurs near pH 4.5 for ribonuclease T1 and between pH 7 and 9 for ribonuclease A. The pH dependence suggests that electrostatic interactions among the charged groups make a relatively small contribution to the conformational stability of these proteins. The dependence of delta G on urea concentration increases from about 1200 cal mol-1 M-1 at high pH to about 2400 cal mol-1 M-1 at low pH for ribonuclease A. This suggests that the unfolded conformations of RNase A become more accessible to urea as the net charge on the molecule increases. For RNase T1, the dependence of delta G on urea concentration is minimal near pH 6 and increases at both higher and lower pH. An analysis of information of this type for several proteins in terms of a model developed by Tanford [Tanford, C. (1964) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86, 2050-2059] suggests that the unfolded states of proteins in urea and GdnHCl solutions may differ significantly in the extent of their interaction with denaturants.

The unfolding process was reversible. Reactivation of the completely denatured enzyme (in 7.8 M guanidinium chloride) was obtained upon removal of the denaturant by stepwise dilution; 100% reactivation was observed when refolding was carried out via a guanidinium chloride concentration of 4 M in the first dilution step. Particular attention has been paid to the role of Ca2+ which activates and stabilizes this archaeal pullulanase against thermal inactivation. The enzyme binds two Ca2+ ions with a Kd of 0.080 +/- 0.010 microM and a Hill coefficient H of 1.00 +/- 0.10.

Previous homology-based protein design efforts typically investigate positions with low sequence identity, whereas this study focuses on semi-conserved core residues and proximal residues, exploring their role(s) in mediating stabilizing interactions on the basis of structural considerations. The A20R and L30Y mutations allow increased hydrophobic interactions because of complimentary surfaces and an electrostatic interaction with a third residue adjacent to the ligand-binding hydrophobic cluster, increasing stability significantly beyond what additivity would predict for the single mutations. The D34T mutation situated in a pi-turn possibly disengages Asn31, allowing it to make up to three hydrogen bonds with the backbone in strand 1 and loop 2. The synergistic mutations A20R/L30Y in combination with the remotely located mutation D34T add together to create a hYap WW domain that is significantly more stable than any of the protein structures on which the design was based (Pin and FBP28 WW domains).",

As observed in the bovine and goat proteins, the presence of the extra methionine residue in the recombinant protein remarkably destabilized the native state, and the destabilization was entirely ascribed to an increase in the rate of unfolding. The thermodynamic stability of the native state against the unfolded state was lower, and the thermodynamic stability of the molten globule state against the unfolded state was higher for the human protein than for the other alpha-lactalbumins previously studied. Thus, the population of the molten globule intermediate was higher during the equilibrium unfolding of human alpha-lactalbumin by guanidine hydrochloride. Unlike the molten globule states of the bovine and goat proteins, the human alpha-lactalbumin molten globule showed remarkably more intense circular dichroism ellipticity than the native state in the far-ultraviolet region below 225 nm. During refolding from the unfolded state, human alpha-lactalbumin thus exhibited overshoot kinetics, in which the alpha-helical peptide ellipticity exceeded the native value when the molten globule folding intermediate was formed in the burst phase. The subsequent folding involved reorganization of nonnative secondary structures. It should be noted that the rate constant of the major refolding phase was approximately the same among the three types of alpha-lactalbumin and that the rate constant of unfolding was accelerated 18-600 times in the human protein, and these results interpreted the lower thermodynamic stability of this protein.",

The calorimetric enthalpy was found to be 150 kcal/mol, independent of the presence of D-glucose. On a weight basis this value is lower than that for soluble proteins, but it is comparable to values obtained with other integral membrane proteins. The van't Hoff enthalpy is similar to the calorimetric enthalpy, within the experimental error, indicating that the transition is not likely to be cooperative. The activation energy is estimated from both the scan rate dependence of the transition temperature and from the shape of the DSC curve. The presence of 500 mM D-glucose slightly decreases the activation energy.

Monitoring the time course of native molecules and of both intermediates shows that the NaCl-induced state (I(2)) is located on neither of the two folding pathways observed at low-salt concentrations. These results suggest that I(2) is a metastable high-energy intermediate at low-ionic strength and is located on a third folding pathway.

        "abstract": "To elucidate early stages in protein folding, we have adopted a fragment reconstitution method for small proteins. This approach is expected to provide nuclei for protein folding and to allow us to investigate folding mechanisms. In previous work [Kobayashi, N., et al. (1995) FEBS Lett. 366, 99-103.] we demonstrated the association of two complementary fragments, derived from the immunoglobulin G-binding domain B1 of streptococcal Protein G, and showed the structural similarity between the reconstituted domain and the uncleaved wild-type domain. In this work we have further characterized the reconstituted domain as well as the uncleaved domain thermodynamically by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) measurements. Although composed of short peptide fragments not linked by covalent bonds, the reconstituted domain showed a typical folding/unfolding curve in both DSC and CD melting measurements and behaved like a globular protein. The domain was not very stable, and the small value of the Gibbs free energy corresponded to the class of the weakest protein-protein binding systems. The denaturation temperature of 0. 78 mM solution was 313 K at pH 5.9 as measured by DSC, which was more than 40 degrees lower than the uncleaved domain. This apparent instability was primarily caused by entropic disadvantage attributed to a bimolecular reaction. The temperature dependence of the enthalpy change from the folded to the unfolded state was almost identical for the reconstituted domain and the uncleaved one. This indicates that most of the noncovalent intramolecular interactions stabilizing the native structure, such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, are regenerated in the reconstituted domain. By comparing the equilibrium constants of the reconstituted and uncleaved domains, we determined the effective concentration to be approximately 6 M at 298 K. Structure-based estimation of the thermodynamic properties from the values of accessible surface areas showed that approximately 35% of the total heat capacity change and approximately 25% of the total enthalpy change can be attributed to the interchain interaction at 298 K. Furthermore, the folding/unfolding equilibrium of beta-hairpin structure of the fragment 41-56 alone was also characterized. These analyses allow us to envision the microdomain folding mechanism of the Protein G B1 domain, in which segment 41-56 first forms a stable beta-hairpin structure and then collides with segment 1-40, followed by spontaneous folding of the whole molecule.",

Several inactive helix A variants were purified and found to have reduced thermal stability relative to wild-type Arc, with a rough correlation between the number of polar-to-hydrophobic substitutions and the magnitude of the stability defect. Quite different results were obtained in helix B, where variants with as many as five polar-to-hydrophobic substitutions were found to be biologically active and one variant with three hydrophobic substitutions had a t(m) 6 degrees C higher than wild-type.

Although much attention has been paid to secondary and tertiary structures, there is no definitive view about the relationship between these structures, compactness, and hydrophobic interactions during the process of protein folding. We show here that the molten globule intermediates of horse apomyoglobin exhibit cold denaturation in addition to heat denaturation, which indicates that the heat capacity change upon unfolding is positive and significant. This demonstrates a small but distinct contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the stability of the molten globule state. We determined the radius of gyration of the various conformational states of horse apomyoglobin and holomyoglobin by measuring small angle X-ray scattering. By comparing the conformational states in terms of secondary structure, radius of gyration, and change in heat capacity upon unfolding, we constructed a folding profile. The profile shows that the protein becomes more compact with formation of the secondary structure, but does not form substantial hydrophobic interactions until a later rate-limiting stage when tight packing of the protein side chains occurs. A very similar profile was also obtained with horse cytochrome c. We propose that the folding profile obtained with these proteins will be common to many globular proteins.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid deposits are frequently formed by mutant proteins that have a lower stability than the wild-type proteins. Some reports, however, have shown that mutant-induced thermodynamic destabilization is not always a general mechanism of amyloid formation. To obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation, we show in this study that equilibrium and kinetic refolding-unfolding reaction experiments with two amyloidogenic mutant human lysozymes (I56T and D67H) yield folding pathways that can be drawn as Gibbs energy diagrams. The equilibrium stabilities between the native and denatured states of both mutant proteins were decreased, but the degrees of instability were different. The Gibbs energy diagrams of the folding process reveal that the Gibbs energy change between the native and folding intermediate states was similar for both proteins, and also that the activation Gibbs energy change from the native state to the transition state decreased. Our results confirm that the tendency to favor the intermediate of denaturation facilitates amyloid formation by the mutant human lysozymes more than equilibrium destabilization between the native and completely denatured states does.",

In the reaction cell, the pressure can be increased or decreased by 100-160 bar within 50-100 microseconds and then held constant. Thus, unfolding and refolding reactions in the time range from 70 microseconds to 70 s can be followed with this technique. Measurements are possible in the transition regions of thermally or denaturant-induced folding in a wide range of temperatures and solvent conditions. We used this pressure-jump method to determine the temperature dependence of the rate constants of unfolding and refolding of the cold shock protein of Bacillus subtilis and of three variants thereof with Phe --> Ala substitutions in the central beta-sheet region. For all variants, the change in heat capacity occurred in refolding between the unfolded and activated states, suggesting that the overall native-like character of the activated state of folding was not changed by the deletion of individual Phe side chains. The Phe27Ala mutation affected the rate of unfolding only; the Phe15Ala and Phe17Ala mutations changed the kinetics of both unfolding and refolding. Although the activated state of folding of the cold shock protein is overall native-like, individual side chains are still in a non-native environment.",

        "abstract": "The influence of core hydrophobicity and packing on the structure and stability of the hyperthermophile proteins Sac7d and Sso7d have been studied by calorimetry, circular dichroism, and NMR. Valine 30 is positioned in Sac7d to allow a cavity-filling Val --> Ile substitution which occurs naturally in the homologous more thermostable Sso7d. The cavity-filling mutation in Sac7d has been characterized and compared to the reciprocal Ile --> Val mutation in Sso7d. A detailed analysis of the stability of the proteins was obtained by globally fitting the variation of DSC parameters and circular dichroism intensities as a function of temperature (0-100 degrees C), salt (0-0.3 M), and pH (0-8). A global analysis over such a range of conditions permitted an unusually precise measure of the thermodynamic parameters, as well as the separation of the thermodynamics of the intrinsic unfolding reaction from the linked effects of protonation and chloride binding associated with acid-induced folding. The results indicate differences in the energetics of unfolding Sac7d and Sso7d that would not be apparent from an analysis of DSC data alone using conventional methods. The sign and magnitude of the changes in DeltaG, DeltaH, TDeltaS, and DeltaC(P) of unfolding resulting from core Ile/Val substitutions in the two proteins were consistent with differences in hydrophobicity of Val and Ile and negligible changes in packing (van der Waals) interactions. The benefit of increased hydrophobicity of the core increased with temperature, with maximal effect around 116 degrees C. Increased hydrophobicity of the core achieved not only an increase in the free energy of unfolding, but also a lateral shift of the temperature of maximal stability to higher temperature.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between structure and stability has been investigated for the folded forms and the unfolded forms of iso-2 cytochrome c and a variant protein with a stability-enhancing mutation, N52I iso-2. Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to measure the reversible unfolding transitions for the proteins in both heme oxidation states. Reduction potentials have been measured as a function of temperature for the folded forms of the proteins. The combination of measurements of thermal stability and reduction potential gives three sides of a thermodynamic cycle and allows prediction of the reduction potential of the thermally unfolded state. The free energies of electron binding for the thermally unfolded proteins differ from those expected for a fully unfolded protein, suggesting that residual structure modulates the reduction potential. At temperatures near 50 degrees C the N52I mutation has a small but significant effect on oxidation state-sensitive structure in the thermally unfolded protein. Inspection of the high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of iso-2 and N52I iso-2 shows that the effects of the N52I mutation and oxidation state on native protein stability are correlated with changes in the mobility of specific polypeptide chain segments and with altered hydrogen bonding involving a conserved water molecule. However, there is no clear explanation of oxidation state or mutation-induced differences in stability of the proteins in terms of observed changes in structure and mobility of the folded forms of the proteins alone.",

The residual structure can be monitored by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy studies of histidine 92 whose C epsilon proton is sensitive to the slow exchange between this form and the unfolded protein. The temperature dependence of the cooperative urea-induced unfolding transition between intermediate and unfolded forms demonstrates that this process involves negative values for both the enthalpy and entropy changes at 25 degrees C. The effects of replacements of several nonpolar side chains adjacent to histidine 92 on the slopes and midpoints of the unfolding transition curve show that these side chains participate in the residual structure. A 15-residue peptide spanning histidine 92 and the mutated residues, however, is not sufficient to define this structure. These results demonstrate that the residual structure in the alpha subunit is stabilized by the hydrophobic effect and may involve side chains which are distant in sequence to histidine 92.",

        "abstract": "The hydrophobic interfaces of coiled-coil proteins and peptides are typically interspersed with buried polar residues. These polar residues are known to be important for defining oligomeric specificity and chain orientation in coiled-coil formation; however, their effects on the folding/assembly reaction have not been investigated. The commonly studied 33-residue dimeric leucine zipper peptide, GCN4-p1, contains a single polar Asn in the center of the hydrophobic interface at position 16. Peptides containing either a valine or an alanine replacement at this position, N16V and N16A, respectively, were studied in order to investigate both the thermodynamic and kinetic roles of the buried polar side-chain on the folding of GCN4-p1. Equilibrium sedimentation confirmed that both the N16V and N16A mutations reduce the dimeric specificity of GCN4-p1, leading to the population of both dimers and trimers in the absence of denaturant. Guanidine hydrochloride-induced equilibrium unfolding of the mutant peptides demonstrated that N16V is more stable than the wild-type sequence, while the N16A peptide is moderately destabilized. Comparison of the refolding reactions indicate that Asn16 is not involved in the rate-limiting association step leading to the native dimer; only the unfolding reaction is sensitive to the mutations. More complex unfolding kinetics for both peptides at high peptide concentrations can be attributed to the presence of trimers in the absence of denaturant. These results show that the role of buried polar residues in leucine zipper peptides can be primarily thermodynamic; subunit exchange reactions can be controlled by the stability of the native coiled coil and its influence on the unfolding/dissociation process.",

        "abstract": "The ability to rationally engineer a protein with altered stability depends upon the detailed understanding of the role of noncovalent interactions in defining thermodynamic properties of proteins. In this paper, we used T. celer L30e as a model to address the question of the role of charge-charge interactions in defining the stability of this protein. A total of 26 single-site charge-to-alanine variants of this protein were generated, and the stability of these proteins was determined using thermal- and denaturant-induced unfolding. It was found that, although L30e is isolated from a thermophilic organism and is highly thermostable, some of the substitutions lead to a further increase in the transition temperature. Analysis of the effects of high ionic strength on the stabilities of L30e variants shows that the long-range charge-charge interactions are as important as the short-range (salt bridge) interactions. The changes in stabilities of the T. celer L30e protein variants were compared with the changes in the energy of charge-charge interactions calculated using different computational models. It was found that there is a good qualitative agreement between experimental and calculated data: for 70-80% (19-21 of 26, confidence p < 0.003) of the variants, computational models predict correctly the sign of the stability changes. In particular, computational models identify correctly those charged amino acid residue substitutions of which led to enhancement in thermostability. Thus, optimization of the charge-charge interactions might be a useful approach for the rational increase in protein stability.",

A completely synthetic gene was constructed that expresses a variant of the wild-type sequence with all 3 cysteines replaced with alanine. The resulting recombinant protein is active and folds reversibly. Denaturation studies monitored by circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence yield coincident curves that suggest the equilibrium unfolding reaction is a 2-state process. Acid denaturation, however, reveals a cooperative transition at approximately pH 1.8 to a partially folded state. This acid state can be further denatured in a reversible manner by the addition of heat or urea as monitored by either CD or tryptophan fluorescence. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies indicate that the acid state of RNase H is both compact and monomeric. Although compact, the acid state does not resemble the native protein: the acid state displays a near-UV CD spectrum similar to the unfolded state and binds to and enhances the fluorescence of the dye 1-anilinonaphthalene, 8-sulfonate much more than either the native or unfolded states. Therefore, the acid state of E. coli RNase H has the characteristics of a molten globule: it retains a high degree of secondary structure, remains compact, yet does not appear to contain a tightly packed core.",

A mutation has been described that causes nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and produces a thermolabile aldolase (Kishi H et al., 1987, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 84:8623-8627). The disease arises from substitution of Gly for Asp-128, a residue at the subunit interface of human aldolase A. To elucidate the role of this residue in the highly homologous rabbit aldolase A, site-directed mutagenesis is used to replace Asp-128 with Gly, Ala, Asn, Gln, or Val. Rabbit aldolase D128G purified from Escherichia coli is found to be similar to human D128G by kinetic analysis, CD, and thermal inactivation assays. All of the mutant rabbit aldolases are similar to the wild-type rabbit enzyme in secondary structure and kinetic properties. In contrast, whereas the wild-type enzyme is a tetramer, chemical crosslinking and gel filtration indicate that a new dimeric species exists for the mutants. In sedimentation velocity experiments, the mutant enzymes as mixtures of dimer and tetramer at 4 degrees C. Sedimentation at 20 degrees C shows that the mutant enzymes are > 99.5% dimeric and, in the presence of substrate, that the dimeric species is active. Differential scanning calorimetry demonstrates that Tm values of the mutant enzymes are decreased by 12 degrees C compared to wild-type enzyme. The results indicate that Asp-128 is important for interface stability and suggest that 1 role of the quaternary structure of aldolase is to provide thermostability.",

        "abstract": "Our recently reported pressure-jump relaxation kinetics experiments on staphylococcal nuclease folding and unfolding [Vidugiris et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 4909] demonstrated that both transitions exhibit positive activation volumes, with that of folding being much larger than that of unfolding. Thus high pressure denatures proteins by slowing the rate of folding more than that of unfolding. In the present work, we take advantage of the very slow folding and unfolding rates under pressure to examine the kinetics and volume changes along the reaction coordinate for protein folding-unfolding for an interesting set of mutants of staphylococcal nuclease: P42G, P47G, P117G, and the double mutant, P47G+P117G. Previous studies have shown that replacement of an individual proline residue at position 42, 47, or 117 by glycine leads to paradoxical protein stabilization against denaturation by guanidine chloride, high temperature, or high pressure. In order to observe unfolding over an attainable pressure range, guanidine hydrochloride was employed. Within experimental error, the activation volumes and equilibrium volume changes were independent of the concentration of this denaturant and our analysis of the rate constants is consistent with the generally accepted hypothesis that this denaturant acts both by increasing the rate of unfolding and decreasing the rate of folding. We show that the stabilization resulting from each of the proline-to-glycine substitutions arises primarily from a decrease in the unfolding rate, and to a small degree, from an increase in the folding rate. The changes in rate constants upon proline-to-glycine substitution can be modeled in terms of small stabilization of the unfolded state, a greater stabilization of the transition state, and a still greater stabilization of the folded state. Although the rates were found to change for all of the mutants in the set, no changes greater than experimental error were found in the corresponding equilibrium volume changes and activation volumes for folding and unfolding. At low pressures (well below the onset of unfolding) the pressure-jump relaxation profiles for wild type proteins (both Foggi and V8) showed kinetic complexity. Although the effect was attenuated somewhat in pressure-jump profiles of one proline-to-glycine mutant (P42G), its persistence in data from all the mutants studied leads us to conclude that its origin is not cis/trans peptide bond isomerization at proline 117, 47, or 42.",

        "abstract": "Whereas melittin at micromolar concentrations is unfolded under conditions of low salt at neutral pH, it transforms to a tetrameric alpha-helical structure under several conditions, such as high peptide concentration, high anion concentration, or alkaline pH. The anion- and pH-dependent stabilization of the tetrameric structure is similar to that of the molten globule state of several acid-denatured proteins, suggesting that tetrameric melittin might be a state similar to the molten globule state. To test this possibility, we studied the thermal unfolding of tetrameric melittin using far-UV CD and differential scanning calorimetry. The latter technique revealed a broad but distinct heat absorption peak. The heat absorption curves were consistent with the unfolding transition observed by CD and were explainable by a 2-state transition mechanism between the tetrameric alpha-helical state and the monomeric unfolded state. From the peptide or salt-concentration dependence of unfolding, the heat capacity change upon unfolding was estimated to be 5 kJ (mol of tetramer)-1 K-1 at 30 degrees C and decreased with increasing temperature. The observed change in heat capacity was much smaller than that predicted from the crystallographic structure (9.2 kJ (mol of tetramer)-1 K-1), suggesting that the hydrophobic residues of tetrameric melittin in solution are exposed in comparison with the crystallographic structure. However, the results also indicate that the structure is more ordered than that of a typical molten globule state.

The stabilization occurs in the presence of urea, as measured by the dependence of the unfolding temperature on urea concentration.

The sequence of ClpB contains two ATP-binding regions that are enclosed between the N- and C-terminal extensions. Whereas it has been found that the N-terminal region of ClpB is essential for the chaperone activity, the structure of this region is not known, and its biochemical properties have not been studied. We expressed and purified the N-terminal fragment of ClpB (residues 1-147). Circular dichroism of the isolated N-terminal region showed a high content of alpha-helical structure. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the N-terminal region of ClpB is thermodynamically stable and contains a single folding domain. The N-terminal domain is monomeric, as determined by gel-filtration chromatography, and the elution profile of the N-terminal domain does not change in the presence of the N-terminally truncated ClpB (ClpBDeltaN). This indicates that the N-terminal domain does not form strong contacts with ClpBDeltaN. Consistently, addition of the separated N-terminal domain does not reverse an inhibition of ATPase activity of ClpBDeltaN in the presence of casein. As shown by ELISA measurements, full-length ClpB and ClpBDeltaN bind protein substrates (casein, inactivated luciferase) with similar affinity. We also found that the isolated N-terminal domain of ClpB interacts with heat-inactivated luciferase. Taken together, our results indicate that the N-terminal fragment of ClpB forms a distinct domain that is not strongly associated with the ClpB core and is not required for ClpB interactions with other proteins, but may be involved in recognition of protein substrates.",

Here, we have generated a series of mutants of this beta-sandwich protein, changing the hydrophobic moment and conformational stability, to investigate the structure-emulsification relationship. Predictive modelling of the hydrophobic moment of beta-strands and mutations known to increase conformational stability were used to generate the series. The proteins were tested for their emulsion stability and EE for oil-in-water mixtures. We show that the stabilization of emulsions by beta-sandwich proteins is best predicted by conformational stability during equilibrium denaturation in ionic surfactant. In contrast, the EE of these proteins is inversely related to an increase in their surface hydrophobicity following unfolding in surfactant. We also describe a novel beta-sandwich emulsifier with strong EE. The requirement for interdomain flexibility to achieve maximum emulsion stability and EE is also shown. This work increases our understanding of the mechanisms involved in protein emulsification and will be of use to the microencapsulation of proteins into polyester microspheres via emulsion-extraction protocols.",

        "abstract": "The F(1)F(0) ATP synthase is a reversible molecular motor that employs a rotary catalytic cycle to couple a chemiosmotic membrane potential to the formation/hydrolysis of ATP. The multisubunit enzyme contains two copies of the b subunit that form a homodimer as part of a narrow, peripheral stalk structure that connects the membrane (F(0)) and soluble (F(1)) sectors. The three-dimensional structure of the b subunit is unknown making the nature of any interactions or conformational changes within the F(1)F(0) complex difficult to interpret. We have used circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses of a series of N- and C-terminal truncated b proteins to investigate its stability and structure. Thermal denaturation of the b constructs exhibited distinct two-state, cooperative unfolding with T(m) values between 30 and 40 degrees C. CD spectra for the region comprising residues 53-122 (b(53-122)) showed theta;(222)/theta;(208) = 0.99, which reduced to 0.92 in the presence of the hydrophobic solvent trifluoroethanol. Thermodynamic parameters for b(53-122) (DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaC(p)) were similar to those reported for several nonideal, coiled-coil proteins. Together these results are most consistent with a noncanonical and unstable parallel coiled-coil at the interface of the b dimer.",

        "title": "Equilibrium folding of dimeric class mu glutathione transferases involves a stable monomeric intermediate.", 
        "abstract": "The conformational stabilities of two homodimeric class mu glutathione transferases (GSTM1-1 and GSTM2-2) were studied by urea- and guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation. Unfolding is reversible and structural changes were followed with far-ultraviolet circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence, enzyme activity, chemical cross-linking, and size-exclusion chromatography. Disruption of secondary structure occurs as a monophasic transition and is independent of protein concentration. Changes in tertiary structure occur as two transitions; the first is protein concentration dependent, while the second is weakly dependent (GSTM1-1) or independent (GSTM2-2). The second transition corresponds with the secondary structure transition. Loss in catalytic activity occurs as two transitions for GSTM1-1 and as one transition for GSTM2-2. These transitions are dependent upon protein concentration. The first deactivation transition coincides with the first tertiary structure transition. Dimer dissociation occurs prior to disruption of secondary structure. The data suggest that the equilibrium unfolding/refolding of the class mu glutathione transferases M1-1 and M2-2 proceed via a three-state process: N(2) <--> 2I <--> 2U. Although GSTM1-1 and GSTM2-2 are homologous (78% identity/94% homology), their N(2) tertiary structures are not identical. Dissociation of the GSTM1-1 dimer to structured monomers (I) occurs at lower denaturant concentrations than for GSTM2-2. The monomeric intermediate for GSTM1-1 is, however, more stable than the intermediate for GSTM2-2. The intermediates are catalytically inactive and display nativelike secondary structure. Guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation yields monomeric intermediates, which have a more loosely packed tertiary structure displaying enhanced solvent exposure of its tryptophans and enhanced ANS binding. The three-state model for the class mu enzymes is in contrast to the equilibrium two-state models previously proposed for representatives of classes alpha/pi/Sj26 GSTs. Class mu subunits appear to be intrinsically more stable than those of the other GST classes.",

        "abstract": "The covalently attached heme and its axial ligands not only are essential for the structure and function of cytochrome c but they also play an important role in the folding process. Under typical denaturing conditions (concentrated guanidine hydrochloride or urea near pH 7), one of the axial ligands, His 18, remains bound to the oxidized heme iron, but the second ligand, Met 80, is replaced by a non-native histidine ligand (His 26 or His 33 in horse cytochrome c). Using quenched-flow and NMR methods, hydrogen exchange rates were measured for several individual amide protons in guanidine-denatured horse cytochrome c. The observation of a single highly protected (140-fold) backbone amide, that of His 18, suggests the presence of a persistent H-bond consistent with heme ligation of the His 18 side chain in the unfolded state. Heme absorbance changes induced by rapid acidification of oxidized cytochrome c in 4.5 M guanidine hydrochloride from pH 7.8 to 4.6 or below exhibit two kinetic phases with rates of 110 and 25 s-1, attributed to the dissociation of non-native histidine ligands from the heme in the unfolded state. The kinetics of folding from guanidine-denatured cytochrome c under a variety of initial and final conditions was investigated by stopped-flow methods, using tryptophan fluorescence as a conformational probe and Soret absorbance as a probe for the ligation state of the heme. A fast kinetic phase (80 s-1) accompanied by a major decrease in fluorescence and a minor absorbance change coincides with the formation of a partially folded intermediate with interacting chain termini detected in earlier pulsed NH exchange measurements [Roder, H., El\u00f6ve, G. A., & Englander, S. W. (1988) Nature 335, 700]. At neutral pH, an intermediate kinetic phase (1.8 s-1) accounts for 78% of the absorbance change and 47% of the fluorescence change. In contrast, the folding kinetics at pH 5 is dominated by the fast phase, and the amplitude of the intermediate phase is reduced to approximately 10%. The pH-dependent amplitude changes show titration behavior with an apparent pK of approximately 5.7, consistent with the protonation of a single histidine residue. The intermediate phase can also be suppressed by the addition of 20 mM imidazole. Since both of these conditions interfere with histidine ligation, the intermediate kinetic phase is attributed to the presence of a non-native histidine ligand (His 26 or His 33) that can become trapped in a partially folded intermediate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The structural origin of the decrease in system volume upon protein denaturation by pressure has remained a puzzle for decades. This negative volume change upon unfolding is assumed to arise globally from more intimate interactions between the polypeptide chain and water, including electrostriction of buried charges that become exposed upon unfolding, hydration of the polypeptide backbone and amino acid side chains and elimination of packing defects and internal void volumes upon unfolding of the chain. However, the relative signs and magnitudes of each of these contributing factors have not been experimentally determined. Our laboratory has probed the fundamental basis for the volume change upon unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease (Snase) using variable solution conditions and point mutants of Snase (Royer CA et al., 1993, Biochemistry 32:5222-5232; Frye KJ et al., 1996, Biochemistry 35:10234-10239). Our prior results indicate that for Snase, neither electrostriction nor polar or nonpolar hydration contributes significantly to the value of the volume change of unfolding. In the present work, we investigate the pressure induced unfolding of three point mutants of Snase in which internal cavity size is altered. The experimentally determined volume changes of unfolding for the mutants suggest that loss of internal void volume upon unfolding represents the major contributing factor to the value of the volume change of Snase unfolding.",

        "abstract": "The folding of collagen in vitro is very slow and presents difficulties in reaching equilibrium, a feature that may have implications for in vivo collagen function. Peptides serve as good model systems for examining equilibrium thermal transitions in the collagen triple helix. Investigations were carried out to ascertain whether a range of synthetic triple-helical peptides of varying sequences can reach equilibrium, and whether the triple helix to unfolded monomer transition approximates a two-state model. The thermal transitions for all peptides studied are fully reversible given sufficient time. Isothermal experiments were carried out to obtain relaxation times at different temperatures. The slowest relaxation times, on the order of 10-15 h, were observed at the beginning of transitions, and were shown to result from self-association limited by the low concentration of free monomers, rather than cis-trans isomerization. Although the fit of the CD equilibrium transition curves and the concentration dependence of T(m) values support a two-state model, the more rigorous comparison of the calorimetric enthalpy to the van't Hoff enthalpy indicates the two-state approximation is not ideal. Previous reports of melting curves of triple-helical host-guest peptides are shown to be a two-state kinetic transition, rather than an equilibrium transition.",

        "abstract": "The 13.5 kDa N-terminal part of the propeptide remains associated with mature cathepsin C after proteolytic activation and excision of the activation peptide. This residual pro-part, isolated from the recombinant enzyme, folds spontaneously and rapidly to a stable, compact monomer with secondary structure and stable tertiary interactions. Folding and unfolding kinetics of the residual pro-part with intact disulfides are complex, and accumulation of transient intermediates is observed. The cleaved form of the pro-part isolated from natural human cathepsin C also folds, suggesting that the intact form comprises two folding domains. The linkages of the two disulfide bridges have been established as 30-118 and 54-136 for the native enzyme. The native disulfide bonds can be re-formed from the fully reduced and denatured state by oxidative refolding, resulting in a domain that is spectroscopically indistinguishable from the original refolded residual pro-part. Both disulfides are solvent-exposed and can be reduced in the absence of denaturant. The reduced form retains most or all of the native tertiary structure and is only approximately 2 kcal.mol(-1) less stable than the oxidized form. It folds fast relative to the rate of biosynthesis, to the same conformation as the oxidized form. Folding and disulfide formation are sequential. These results indicate that the proenzyme folds sequentially in vivo and that the residual pro-part constitutes a rapidly and independently folding domain that stabilizes the mature enzyme. It thus fulfills the criteria required of an intramolecular chaperone. It may also be involved in stabilizing the tetrameric structure of the mature enzyme.",

        "abstract": "To understand the structural basis of thermostability, we have determined the solution structure of a thermophilic ribosomal protein L30e from Thermococcus celer by NMR spectroscopy. The conformational stability of T. celer L30e was measured by guanidine and thermal-induced denaturation, and compared with that obtained for yeast L30e, a mesophilic homolog. The melting temperature of T. celer L30e was 94 degrees C, whereas the yeast protein denatured irreversibly at temperatures >45 degrees C. The two homologous proteins also differ greatly in their stability at 25 degrees C: the free energy of unfolding was 45 kJ/mole for T. celer L30e and 14 kJ/mole for the yeast homolog. The solution structure of T. celer L30e was compared with that of the yeast homolog. Although the two homologous proteins do not differ significantly in their number of hydrogen bonds and the amount of solvent accessible surface area buried with folding, the thermophilic T. celer L30e was found to have more long-range ion pairs, more proline residues in loops, and better helix capping residues in helix-1 and helix-4. A K9A variant of T. celer L30e was created by site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of electrostatic interactions on protein stability. Although the melting temperatures of the K9A variant is approximately 8 degrees C lower than that of the wild-type L30e, their difference in T(m) is narrowed to approximately 4.2 degrees C at 0.5 M NaCl. This salt-dependency of melting temperatures strongly suggests that electrostatic interactions contribute to the thermostability of T. celer L30e.",

        "abstract": "The interaction between ligands and proteins usually induces changes in protein thermal stability with modifications in the midpoint denaturation temperature, enthalpy of unfolding, and heat capacity. These modifications are due to the coupling of unfolding with binding equilibrium. Furthermore, they can be attained by changes in protein structure and conformational flexibility induced by ligand interaction. To study these effects we have used bovine serum albumin (BSA) interacting with three different anilinonaphthalene sulfonate derivatives (ANS). These ligands have different effects on protein stability, conformation, and dynamics. Protein stability was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy, whereas conformational changes were detected by circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy including kinetics of hydrogen/deuterium exchange. The order of calorimetric midpoint of denaturation was: 1,8-ANS-BSA > 2,6-ANS-BSA > free BSA > (nondetected) bis-ANS-BSA. Both 1,8-ANS and 2,6-ANS did not substantially modify the secondary structure of BSA, whereas bis-ANS induced a distorted alpha-helix conformation with an increase of disordered structure. Protein flexibility followed the order: 1,8-ANS-BSA < 2,6-ANS-BSA < free BSA < bis-ANS-BSA, indicating a clear correlation between stability and conformational flexibility. The structure induced by an excess of bis-ANS to BSA is compatible with a molten globule-like state. Within the context of the binding landscape model, we have distinguished five conformers (identified by subscript): BSA(1,8-ANS), BSA(2,6-ANS), BSA(free), BSA(bis-ANS), and BSA(unfolded) among the large number of possible states of the conformational dynamic ensemble. The relative population of each distinguishable conformer depends on the type and concentration of ligand and the temperature of the system.",

SEA and SEE have approximately 80% sequence identity but show some differences in their biological function. Here, the two superantigens and analogues were characterized biophysically. SEE was shown to have a substantially higher thermal stability than SEA. Both SEA and SEE were thermally stabilized by 0.1 mM Zn(2+) compared with Zn(2+)-reduced conditions achieved using 1 mM EDTA or specific replacements that affect Zn(2+) coordination. The higher stability of SEE was only partly caused by the T-cell receptor (TCR) binding regions, whereas regions in the vicinity of the major histocompatibility complex class II binding sites affected the stability to a greater extent. SEE exhibited a biphasic denaturation between pH 5.0-6.5, influenced by residues in the TCR binding regions. Interestingly, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, isoelectric focusing, and circular dichroism analysis indicated that conformational changes had occurred in the SEA/E chimerical constructs relative to SEA and SEE. Thus, it is proposed that the Zn(2+) binding site is very important for the stability and potency of SEA and SEE, whereas residues in the TCR binding site have a substantial influence on the molecular conformation to control specificity and function.",

        "abstract": "Standard methods for measuring free energy of protein unfolding by chemical denaturation require complete folding at low concentrations of denaturant so that a native baseline can be observed. Alternatively, proteins that are completely unfolded in the absence of denaturant can be folded by addition of the osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and the unfolding free energy can then be calculated through analysis of the refolding transition. However, neither chemical denaturation nor osmolyte-induced refolding alone is sufficient to yield accurate thermodynamic unfolding parameters for partly folded proteins, because neither method produces both native and denatured baselines in a single transition. Here we combine urea denaturation and TMAO stabilization as a means to bring about baseline-resolved structural transitions in partly folded proteins. For Barnase and the Notch ankyrin domain, which both show two-state equilibrium unfolding, we found that DeltaG degrees for unfolding depends linearly on TMAO concentration, and that the sensitivity of DeltaG degrees to urea (the m-value) is TMAO independent. This second observation confirms that urea and TMAO exert independent effects on stability over the range of cosolvent concentrations required to bring about baseline-resolved structural transitions. Thermodynamic parameters calculated using a global fit that assumes additive, linear dependence of DeltaG degrees on each cosolvent are similar to those obtained by standard urea-induced unfolding in the absence of TMAO. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this method to measurement of the free energy of unfolding of a partly folded protein, a fragment of the full-length Notch ankyrin domain.",

        "abstract": "The interaction between cytochrome c oxidase complex and adenosine triphosphate synthase (F1F0) complex in the purified, dispersed state and embedded in phospholipid vesicles was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and by spin-label electron paramagnetic resonance. The detergent-dispersed cytochrome oxidase and F1F0 complexes undergo endothermic thermodenaturation. However, when these complexes are embedded in phospholipid vesicles, they undergo exothermic thermodenaturation. The energy released is believed to result from the collapse of a strained interaction between unsaturated fatty acyl groups of phospholipids and an exposed area of the complex formed by the removal of interacting proteins. The exothermic enthalpy change of thermodenaturation of a protein-phospholipid exothermic enthalpy change of thermodenaturation of a protein-phospholipid vesicle containing both cytochrome oxidase complex and F1F0 was smaller than that of a mixture of protein-phospholipid vesicles formed from each individual electron transfer complex. This suggests specific interaction between cytochrome oxidase complex and F1F0 in the membrane. Further evidence for interaction between these two complexes is provided by saturation transfer EPR studies in which the rotational correlation time of spin-labeled cytochrome oxidase increases significantly when the complex is mixed with F1F0 prior to being embedded in phospholipid vesicles. From these results, it is concluded that at least a part of cytochrome oxidase and a part of F1F0 form a supermacromolecular complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. No such supermacromolecular complex is detected between F1F0 and ubiquinol--cytochrome c reductase.",

In the present study, various spectroscopic techniques were employed to investigate thermal stability of the monomeric form of yeast hexokinase B (YHB).

The structural transition proved to be significantly reversible below 55 degrees C and irreversible at higher temperatures. Thermoinactivation studies revealed that enzymatic activity diminished significantly at high temperatures, with greater loss of activity observed above 55 degrees C. Release of ammonia upon deamidation of YHB obeyed a similar temperature-dependence pattern. Dynamic light scattering and size exclusion-HPLC indicated formation of stable aggregates. Taking various findings on the influence of osmolytes and chaperone-like agents on YHB thermal denaturation together, it is proposed that the purely conformational transition of YHB is reversible, and irreversibility is due to aggregation, as a major cause.

        "abstract": "Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) serves as an important model system for the examination of almost all aspects of protein structure. Systematic studies of the effects of mutation on the thermodynamic stability of BPTI, however, have been limited by the extreme stability of the protein. A derivative of BPTI containing only the 5-55 disulfide bond, termed [5-55]Ala, has been shown previously to fold into a structure very similar to that of native BPTI and to be a functional trypsin inhibitor. [5-55]Ala undergoes a reversible thermal unfolding transition with a melting temperature of 39 degrees C, and is therefore well suited for stability studies. Using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach, we have examined the contribution to stability of each side-chain in the [5-55]Ala derivative of BPTI. These studies demonstrate the importance of the two hydrophobic cores composed largely of clusters of aromatic residues, as well as the internal hydrogen-bonding network, in stabilizing BPTI. Overall, there is a strong relationship between change in buried surface area and stability for both polar and hydrophobic residues, with proportionality constants of 50 and 20 cal/A2, respectively. None of the alanine substitutions substantially stabilized [5-55]Ala. Nonetheless, approximately 60% (28/46) of the alanine mutants were destabilized by less than 10 degrees C, suggesting that a form of BPTI with up to half of its residues being alanine could fold into a stable structure resembling the native one.",

Widely-shared, helical-bundle spectrin repeats are known to melt at temperatures as low as 40-45 degrees C and are also known to unfold via multiple pathways as single molecules in atomic force microscopy. Given the varied roles of spectrin family proteins in cell deformability, we sought to determine the coupled effects of temperature on forced unfolding. Bimodal distributions of unfolding intervals are seen at all temperatures for the four-repeat beta(1-4) spectrin-an alpha-actinin homolog. The major unfolding length corresponds to unfolding of a single repeat, and a minor peak at twice the length corresponds to tandem repeats. Increasing temperature shows fewer tandem events but has no effect on unfolding intervals. As T approaches T(m), however, mean unfolding forces in atomic force microscopy also decrease; and circular dichroism studies demonstrate a nearly proportional decrease of helical content in solution. The results imply a thermal softening of a helical linker between repeats which otherwise propagates a helix-to-coil transition to adjacent repeats. In sum, structural changes with temperature correlate with both single-molecule unfolding forces and shifts in unfolding pathways.",

In this paper, we explore the relationship between the disulfide's thermodynamic contribution to protein folding and its role in providing resistance to irreversible thermal inactivation. In T4 lysozyme (C54V/C97S), a non-crosslinked mutant lacking the two cysteines found in the wild type, sensitivity toward irreversible thermal inactivation increases dramatically at temperatures above the melting temperature of the molecule. In addition, most of the lost activity can be restored by denaturation/renaturation with guanidine hydrochloride. In contrast, the crosslinked mutant T4 lysozyme (13C-97C/C54V) inactivates relatively slowly, even above its melting temperature, and the lost activity is not restored by denaturation/renaturation. These observations suggest that the predominant inactivation pathways for non-crosslinked T4 lysozymes are conformation related, while those for the crosslinked variant are insensitive to the conformational route and thus are susceptible only to slower processes of a chemical nature. We also show that multiple mutants, constructed to contain the 3-97 disulfide plus a temperature-sensitive lesion, are more stable than the wild type to irreversible inactivation even though they are less stable to reversible thermal unfolding. These findings together suggest that the 3-97 disulfide provides stability to irreversible inactivation primarily via a pathway that is independent of its thermodynamic contribution. The 3-97 disulfide may stabilize T4 lysozyme by restricting the unfolded state to a class of more compact structures with less exposed hydrophobic surface, compared to the unfolded states of non-crosslinked T4 lysozymes. The results have implications both for the use of the stabilizing potential of disulfide bonds in protein engineering and for their roles in protein function and evolution.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding and denaturation curves of leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI) were elucidated using the technique of disulfide scrambling. In the presence of thiol initiator and denaturant, the native LCI denatures by shuffling its native disulfide bonds and transforms into a mixture of scrambled species. 9 of 104 possible scrambled isomers of LCI, amounting to 90% of total denatured LCI, can be distinguished. The denaturation curve that plots the fraction of native LCI converted into scrambled isomers upon increasing concentrations of denaturant shows that the concentration of guanidine thiocyanate and guanidine hydrochloride required to reach 50% of denaturation is 2.4 and 3.6 m, respectively. In contrast, native LCI is resistant to urea denaturation even at high concentration (8 m). The LCI unfolding pathway was defined based on the evolution of the relative concentration of scrambled isoforms of LCI upon denaturation. Two populations of scrambled species suffer variations along the unfolding pathway. One accumulates as intermediates under strong denaturing conditions and corresponds to open or relaxed structures, among which the beads-form isomer is found. The other population shows an inverse correlation between their relative abundances and the denaturing conditions and should have another kind of non-native structure that is more compact than the unfolded state. The rate constants of unfolding of LCI are low when compared with other disulfide-containing proteins. Overall, the results presented in this study show that LCI, a molecule with potential biotechnological applications, has slow kinetics of unfolding and is highly stable.",

        "abstract": "Tryptophan 59 forms the seat of the hydrophobic ligand-binding site in the small immunophilin FKBP12. Mutating this residue to phenylalanine or leucine stabilizes the protein by 2.72 and 2.35 kcal mol(-1), respectively. Here we report the stability data and 1.7 A resolution crystal structures of both mutant proteins, complexed with the immunosuppressant rapamycin. Both structures show a relatively large response to mutation involving a helical bulge at the mutation site and the loss of a hydrogen bond that anchors a nearby loop. The increased stability of the mutants is probably due to a combination of improved packing and an entropic gain at the mutation site. The structures are almost identical to that of wild-type FKBP12.6, an isoform of FKBP12 that differs by 18 residues, including Trp59, in its sequence. Therefore, the structural difference between the two isoforms can be attributed almost entirely to the identity of residue 59. It is likely that in FKBP12-ligand complexes Trp59 provides added binding energy at the active site at the expense of protein stability, a characteristic common to other proteins. FKBP12 associates with the ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle (RyR1), while FKBP12.6 selectively binds the ryanodine receptor in cardiac muscle (RyR2). The structural response to mutation suggests that residue 59 contributes to the specificity of binding between FKBP12 isoforms and ryanodine receptors.",

        "abstract": "d-amino acid oxidase from Trigonopsis variabilis (TvDAAO) is a flavoenzyme with high biotechnological and industrial interest. The overexpression and purification of the apoprotein form of a recombinant His-tagged TvDAAO allowed us to go deep into the structural differences between apoenzyme and holoenzyme, and on the cofactor binding and its contribution to enzyme stability. A significant decrease in intrinsic fluorescence emission took place upon FAD binding, associated to cofactor induced conformational transitions or subunit dimerization that could affect the local environment of protein tryptophan residues. Furthermore, acrylamide-quenching experiments indicated that one of the five tryptophan residues of TvDAAO became less accessible upon FAD binding. A K(d)=1.5+/-0.1x10(-7) M for the dissociation of FAD from TvDAAO was calculated from binding experiments based on both quenching of FAD fluorescence and activity titration curves. Secondary structure prediction indicated that TvDAAO is a mixed alpha/beta protein with 8 alpha-helices and 14 beta-sheets connected by loops. Prediction results were in good agreement with the estimates obtained by circular dichroism which indicated that both the apoenzyme and the holoenzyme had the same structural component ratios: 34% alpha-helix content, 20% beta-structure content (14% antiparallel and 6% parallel beta-sheet), 15% beta-turns and 31% of random structure. Circular dichroism thermal-transition curves suggested single-step denaturation processes with apparent midpoint transition temperatures (T(m)) of 37.9 degrees C and 41.4 degrees C for the apoenzyme and the holoenzyme, respectively. A three-dimensional model of TvDAAO built by homology modelling and consistent with the spectroscopic studies is shown. Comparing our results with those reported for pig kidney (pkDAAO) and Rhodotorula gracilis (RgDAAO) d-amino acid oxidases, a \"head-to-head\" interaction between subunits in the TvDAAO dimer might be expected.",

        "abstract": "Enthalpies and heat capacities were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry for bacteriophage lambda cI repressor binding to DNA containing various combinations of the three operator sites OR1, OR2, and OR3 (each comprising a consensus half-site and a specific nonconsensus half-site). Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to evaluate the effects of specific DNA binding on thermal melting of the N-terminal and C-terminal repressor domains. Principal findings of this study are as follows: (1) Binding of repressor to each of the DNA operators is dominated by a large negative enthalpy, in agreement with earlier van't Hoff analyses of quantitative footprint titration data [Koblan & Ackers (1992) Biochemistry 31, 57-65]. The calorimetric data also revealed negative heat capacities for cI binding that are of comparable magnitude with many other systems [Spolar & Record (1994) Science 263, 777-784]. However, this feature in combination with the large negative values of binding enthalpies leads to an enthalpic dominance throughout the physiological temperature range. The resulting thermodynamic profile is opposite to the entropically dominated binding observed for many systems, including lambda cro repressor which binds to the same sites as cI and also employs a helix-turn-helix binding domain [Takeda et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 8180-8184]. It is suggested that these thermodynamic differences may arise from interactions of the cI repressor's N-terminal \"arm\" with the DNA. (2) Repressor monomers do not bind significantly to DNA containing either a consensus half-site or a nonconsensus half-site. Binding affinity to the double-consensus operator is much weaker than to any of the natural full-site operators. The same was found with other combinations of half-sites. A mutant repressor (PT158) which is severely defective in dimerization [Burz et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 8399-8405] was also found to bind only full-site operators and showed dimeric stoichiometry. (3) The thermal melting unit for N-terminal domains in the absence of DNA was found to reach values of 6-8 (monomer units) at concentrations where high-order oligomers of wild-type protein are formed [Senear et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 6179-6189]. However, in the presence of DNA operator sites, the cooperative unit for thermal unfolding was reduced to precisely two monomers, indicating that the N-terminal domain binds strictly as a dimer. (4) Significant nonadditivity was observed for the repressor binding enthalpies and heat capacities determined with multiple combinations of full-site operators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Here, we report the characterization by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements of a variant form of Sso7d truncated at leucine 54 (L54Delta). It is shown that L54Delta has a folded conformation at neutral pH and that its thermal unfolding is a reversible process, represented well by the two-state N <=> D transition model, with a denaturation temperature of 53 degrees C. Fluorescence titration experiments indicate that L54Delta binds tightly to calf thymus DNA, even though the binding parameters are smaller than those of the wild-type protein. Therefore, the truncation of eight residues at the C-terminus of Sso7d markedly affects the thermal stability of the protein, which nevertheless retains a folded structure and DNA binding activity.",

        "abstract": "By measurement of UV absorbance, CD spectra, and enzyme activity, we have shown that human carbonic anhydrase II forms a stable and compact folding intermediate at a moderate concentration of guanidine hydrochloride. The major aim of this study was to map the intermediate structure. For that reason, site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce cysteine residues in various parts of the central beta-structure to give in each case a single cysteine residue. Thereafter, the accessibility of the introduced SH group to specific chemical labeling was used to probe the stability and compactness of the area surrounding each cysteine residue. Our results indicate that the folding intermediate has an ordered native-like secondary structure in the central part of the beta-sheet, whereas the peripheral part of the beta-sheet seems to be less ordered. A large hydrophobic cluster situated between the central beta-sheet core and secondary structure elements on the surface appears to be intact in the intermediate and is remarkably stable even at high GuHCl concentrations (> 5 M). This unusually stable substructure might function as a \"seed\" during the initiation of the folding process.",

        "abstract": "Many proteins are capable of populating partially folded states known as molten globule states. Alpha-lactalbumin forms a molten globule under a range of conditions including low pH (the A-state) and at neutral pH in the absence of Ca(2+) with modest amounts of denaturant. The A-state is the most thoroughly characterized and thought to mimic a kinetic intermediate populated during refolding at neutral pH. We demonstrate that the properties and interactions that stabilize the A-state and the pH 7 molten globule of human alpha-lactalbumin differ. The unfolding of the wild-type protein is compared to the unfolding of a variant that lacks the 6 - 120 disulfide bond and to an autonomously folded peptide construct that we have previously shown represents the minimum core structure of the A-state of human alpha-lactalbumin. Studies conducted at pH 2 and 7 show that the disulfide makes little contribution to the stability of the molten globule at pH 7 but is important at pH 2. In contrast, the beta-subdomain of the protein is less important at pH 2 than at pH 7. The role of helix propensity in stabilizing the different forms of the molten globule state is examined and it is shown that it cannot account for the differences. The strikingly different behavior observed at pH 2 and 7 indicates that the A-state may not be a rigorous mimic of the folding intermediate populated at pH 7.",

When the stability of the mutant was examined in 2H2O by NMR, CD, or fluorescence, a substantial increase in the amount of folded protein at the tmax was noted as well as a decrease in tmax, reflecting increased stability.",

We have used the pressure dependence of T(M) to evaluate the changes in volume, Delta(v), accompanying each protein transition event as a function of temperature and pressure. From analysis of the temperature and pressure dependences of Delta(v), we have additionally calculated the changes in expansibility, Delta(e), and isothermal compressibility, Delta(k)(T), associated with the thermally induced conformational transitions of cytochrome c. Specifically, if extrapolated to 25 degrees C, the native-to-unfolded (N-to-U) transition is accompanied by changes in volume, Delta(v), expansibility, Delta(e), and isothermal compressibility, Delta(k)(T), of -(5 +/- 3) x 10(-3) cm(3) g(-1), (1.8 +/- 0.3) x 10(-4) cm(3) g(-1) K(-1), and approximately 0 cm(3) g(-1) bar(-1), respectively.

By comparing the volumetric properties of the N-to-U and N-to-MG transitions of cytochrome c, we have estimated the properties of the native-to-molten globule (N-to-MG) transition. For the latter transition, the changes in volume, Delta(v), and isothermal compressibility, Delta(k)(T), are approximately 0 cm(3) g(-1) at 40 degrees C and 1.9 cm(3) g(-1) bar(-1) at 35 degrees C, respectively. Our estimate for the change in expansibility, Delta(e), upon the N-to-MG is negative and equal to -(5 +/- 3) x 10(-4) cm(3) g(-1) K(-1). This finding contrasts with the results of previous studies all of which report positive changes in expansibility associated with protein denaturation.

        "abstract": "The denaturant-induced unfolding kinetics of the 89-residue protein, barstar, have been examined using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) at 25 degrees C and pH 8.0. The core tryptophan, Trp53, in barstar serves as a fluorescence donor, and a thionitrobenzoic acid moiety (TNB) attached to a cysteine residue acts as an acceptor to form an efficient FRET pair. Four different single-cysteine containing mutants of barstar with cysteine residues at positions 25, 40, 62, and 82 were studied. The unfolding kinetics of the four mutant forms of barstar were monitored by measurement of the changes in the fluorescence intensity of Trp53 in the unlabeled and TNB-labeled proteins. The rate of change of fluorescence of the single-tryptophan residue, Trp53, in the unlabeled protein, where no FRET occurs, yields the rate of solvation of the core. This rate is similar for all four unlabeled proteins. The rate of the increase in the fluorescence of Trp53 in the labeled protein, where FRET from the tryptophan to the TNB label occurs, yields the rate of decrease in FRET efficiency during unfolding. The decrease in FRET efficiency for proteins labeled at either of the two buried positions (Cys40 or Cys82) occurs at a rate similar to the rate of core solvation. The decrease in FRET efficiency for the acceptor at Cys40 is also shown to be sensitive to the isomerization of the Tyr47-Pro48 cis bond. For the proteins where the label is at a solvent-exposed position (Cys25 and Cys62), the decrease in FRET efficiency occurs in two kinetic phases; 15-25% of the FRET efficiency decreases in the faster phase, and the remaining FRET efficiency decreases in a slower phase, the rate of which is the same as the rate of core solvation. These results clearly indicate that, during unfolding, the protein surface expands faster than, and independently of, water intrusion into the core.",

In the unfolded state, imino acids both restrict conformational space and present cis-trans isomerization barriers to folding. Because of its high proline and hydroxyproline content, the collagen triple-helix offers an opportunity to characterize the impact of imino acids on the unfolded state and folding kinetics. Here, NMR and CD spectroscopy are used to characterize the role of imino acids in a triple-helical peptide, T1-892, which contains an 18-residue sequence from type I collagen and a C-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp)(4) domain. The replacement of Pro or Hyp by an Ala in the (Gly-Pro-Hyp)(4) region significantly decreases the folding rate at low but not high concentrations, consistent with less efficient nucleation. To understand the molecular basis of the decreased folding rate, changes in the unfolded as well as the folded states of the peptides were characterized. While the trimer states of the peptides are all similar, NMR dynamics studies show monomers with all trans (Gly-Pro-Hyp)(4) are less flexible than monomers containing Pro --> Ala or Hyp --> Ala substitutions. Nucleation requires all trans bonds in the (Gly-Pro-Hyp)(4) domain and the constrained monomer state of the all trans nucleation domain in T1-892 increases its competency to initiate triple-helix formation and illustrates the impact of the unfolded state on folding kinetics.",

        "abstract": "Several members of the RNase A superfamily are endowed with antitumor activity, showing selective cytotoxicity toward tumor cell lines. One of these is onconase, the smallest member of the superfamily, which at present is undergoing phase-III clinical trials as an antitumor drug. Our investigation focused on other interesting features of the enzyme, such as its unusually high denaturation temperature, its low catalytic activity, and its renal toxicity as a drug. We used differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, fluorescence measurements, and limited proteolysis to investigate the molecular determinants of the stability of onconase and of a mutant, (M23L)-ONC, which is catalytically more active than the wild-type enzyme, and fully active as an antitumor agent. The determination of the main thermodynamic parameters of the protein led to the conclusion that onconase is an unusually stable protein. This was confirmed by its resistance to proteolysis. On the basis of this analysis and on a comparative analysis of the (M23L)-ONC variant of the protein, which is less stable and more sensitive to proteolysis, a model was constructed in line with available data. This model supports a satisfactory hypothesis of the molecular basis of onconase stability and low-catalytic activity.",

        "title": "Role of aromatic side chains in the folding and thermodynamic stability of integral membrane proteins.", 
        "abstract": "Aromatic residues are frequently found in helical and beta-barrel integral membrane proteins enriched at the membrane-water interface. Although the importance of these residues in membrane protein folding has been rationalized by thermodynamic partition measurements using peptide model systems, their contribution to the stability of bona fide membrane proteins has never been demonstrated. Here, we have investigated the contribution of interfacial aromatic residues to the thermodynamic stability of the beta-barrel outer membrane protein OmpA from Escherichia coli in lipid bilayers by performing extensive mutagenesis and equilibrium folding experiments. Isolated interfacial tryptophanes contribute -2.0 kcal/mol, isolated interfacial tyrosines contribute -2.6 kcal/mol, and isolated interfacial phenylalanines contribute -1.0 kcal/mol to the stability of this protein. These values agree well with the prediction from the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale, except for tyrosine residues, which contribute more than has been expected from the peptide models. Double mutant cycle analysis reveals that interactions between aromatic side chains become significant when their centroids are separated by less than 6 A but are nearly insignificant above 7 A. Aromatic-aromatic side chain interactions are on the order of -1.0 to -1.4 kcal/mol and do not appear to depend on the type of aromatic residue. These results suggest that the clustering of aromatic side chains at membrane interfaces provides an additional heretofore not yet recognized driving force for the folding and stability of integral membrane proteins.",

This protein has a maximum stability at 12 degrees C in 3 M guanidinium chloride and undergoes reversible high- and low-temperature melting at 28 and -3 degrees C, respectively, in this medium. The free energy of stabilization of the protein has been studied over a range of temperature that includes both melting transitions. The stability curve fits a constant delta Cp model over the entire range, permitting an unusually complete determination of the thermodynamic parameters of the protein and demonstrating that the low-temperature unfolded form of the protein may be interpreted as an extrapolation with constant delta Cp of the high-temperature unfolded form. The free energy of unfolding is a linear function of guanidinium concentration within experimental error which permits a rough estimate of the stability of the protein at low temperatures and of the differential interaction of the unfolded protein with guanidinium chloride. These equilibrium studies provide a basis for the interpretation of the kinetic studies reported in the following paper.",

        "abstract": "In continuation of earlier work [Hu, C. Q., & Sturtevant, J.M. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 178-182], differential scanning calorimetry has been employed in a study of the effects on the thermal denaturation of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase of two inhibitors of the enzyme, sulfate ion and the dye Cibracron blue F3GA. Sulfate ion, as is usual with ligands that dissociate during unfolding of the host protein, raises t1/2, the temperature of half-completion of the denaturation, has only a modest effect, stemming from the enthalpy of dissociation of the ligand, on the enthalpy of denaturation, and has little or no effect on the heat capacity change resulting from denaturation. In sharp contrast, Cibacron blue F3GA lowers t1/2 and drastically decreases both the enthalpy and heat capacity changes due to denaturation. The DSC results with sulfate ion are consistent with previous kinetic data [Scopes, R. K. (1978) Eur. J. Biochem. 91, 119-129; Khamis, M. H., & Larsson-Raznikiewicz, M. (1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 657, 190-194], which indicate two binding sites for sulfate ion at one of which the ligand acts as a competitive inhibitor. The results with Cibacron blue F3GA indicate that the dye induces a major destabilizing structural change in the enzyme in addition to rendering it enzymically inactive.",

        "abstract": "Organisms and cellular systems which have adapted to stresses such as high temperature, desiccation, and urea-concentrating environments have responded by concentrating particular organic solutes known as osmolytes. These osmolytes are believed to confer protection to enzyme and other macromolecular systems against such denaturing stresses. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) experiments were performed on ribonuclease A and hen egg white lysozyme in the presence of varying concentrations of the osmolytes glycine, sarcosine, N,N-dimethylglycine, and betaine. Solutions containing up to several molar concentrations of these solutes were found to result in considerable increases in the thermal unfolding transition temperature (Tm) for these proteins. DSC scans of ribonuclease A in the presence of up to 8.2 M sarcosine resulted in reversible two-state unfolding transitions with Tm increases of up to 22 degrees C and unfolding enthalpy changes which were independent of Tm. On the basis of the thermodynamic parameters observed, 8.2 M sarcosine results in a stabilization free energy increase of 7.2 kcal/mol for ribonuclease A at 65 degrees C. This translates into more than a 45,000-fold increase in stability of the native form of ribonuclease A over that in the absence of sarcosine at this temperature. Catalytic activity measurements in the presence of 4 M sarcosine give kcat and Km values that are largely unchanged from those in the absence of sarcosine. DSC of lysozyme unfolding in the presence of these osmolytes also results in Tm increases of up to 23 degrees C; however, significant irreversibly occurs with this protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

F., Hampsey, D. M., Stewart, J. W., Rackovsky, S., Goldstein, D., & Sherman, F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13225-13236]. Treatment of these proteins with a specific sulfhydryl blocking reagent (methyl methanethiosulfonate) to block Cys-102 has allowed investigation of the properties of monomeric forms of the proteins, denoted iso-1-MS. Comparison of the UV-visible absorbance properties (pH 6, 20 degrees C) shows minor differences between the normal Pro-71 iso-1-MS and two of the three mutant proteins. The Val-71 iso-1-MS protein has absorbance properties indistinguishable from those of the normal Pro-71 iso-1-MS protein, but the Ile-71 iso-1-MS and Thr-71 iso-1-MS proteins show reduced intensity of the 695-nm absorbance band and a small shift in the Soret maximum, from 408 nm for the Pro-71 iso-1-MS and Val-71 iso-1-MS proteins to 406 nm for the Thr-71 iso-1-MS and Ile-71 iso-1-MS proteins. Second derivative spectroscopy is used to assess differences in the polarity of the environment of tyrosine residues. The average degree of exposure of tyrosines to solvent is similar in all four proteins: 0.39 for the normal Pro-71 iso-1-MS and Val-71 iso-1-MS proteins; 0.40 for the Ile-71 iso-1-MS protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Class I MHC molecules are ternary complexes composed of an allotype specific heavy chain, a noncovalently associated protein beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m), and a peptide. The complexes are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum by a complex series of chaperones and peptide-loading mechanisms. In the absence of beta(2)m or peptide, very little class I heavy chain is transported to the surface of the cell. Complexes that do not contain all three parts of the protein are not made productively in vivo and not at all in vitro. The ability of the complex to withstand thermal denaturation in vitro has been shown to be related to the binding affinity of the peptide. Paradoxically, some low-affinity peptide complexes denature at or below human basal body temperatures in vitro but are effective biological agents in vivo. Here we show that these complexes are stabilized against thermal denaturation by physiological cosolvents and maximally stabilized by 150 mM NaCl. While the degree of stabilization by 150 mM NaCl is greatest for low-affinity peptide/MHC complexes, the mechanism of stabilization is independent of peptide sequence. This effect is hypothesized to occur by multiple mechanisms including increasing the affinity of beta(2)m for the complex and charge screening.",

        "abstract": "Single and multiple Xaa----Ala substitutions were constructed in the alpha-helix comprising residues 39-50 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme. The variant with alanines at 10 consecutive positions (A40-49) folds normally and has activity essentially the same as wild type, although it is less stable. The crystal structure of this polyalanine mutant displays no significant change in the main-chain atoms of the helix when compared with the wild-type structure. The individual substitutions of the solvent-exposed residues Asn-40, Ser-44, and Glu-45 with alanine tend to increase the thermostability of the protein, whereas replacements of the buried or partially buried residues Lys-43 and Leu-46 are destabilizing. The melting temperature of the lysozyme in which Lys-43 and Leu-46 are retained and positions 40, 44, 45, 47, and 48 are substituted with alanine (i.e., A40-42/44-45/47-49) is increased by 3.1 degrees C relative to wild type at pH 3.0, but reduced by 1.6 degrees C at pH 6.7. In the case of the charged amino acids Glu-45 and Lys-48, the changes in melting temperature indicate that the putative salt bridge between these two residues contributes essentially nothing to the stability of the protein. The results clearly demonstrate that there is considerable redundancy in the sequence information in the polypeptide chain; not every amino acid is essential for folding. Also, further evidence is provided that the replacement of fully solvent-exposed residues within alpha-helices with alanines may be a general way to increase protein stability. The general approach may permit a simplification of the protein folding problem by retaining only amino acids proven to be essential for folding and replacing the remainder with alanine.",

        "abstract": "One to four alanines were inserted by site-directed mutagenesis at three different locations within the alpha-helix comprising residues 39 to 50 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme. All insertion mutants were correctly folded and catalytically active although the insertions led to a thermal destabilization by 1.1 to 4.2 kcal/mol when compared to wild-type. Variants that restored part of the loss in stability associated with the initial alanine insertions could be found by randomizing the inserted amino acids. In selected cases, directed mutagenesis of adjacent residues was also used to regain stability. Structural information obtained from X-ray crystallography and/or 2D-NMR for 10 different variants showed two distinct ways in which the protein responded to the amino acid insertions: (1) The inserted amino acids were incorporated into the helix by replacing preceding wild-type amino acids and causing a shift in register towards the N terminus. As a consequence, wild-type amino acids were translocated from the helix into the preceding loop. (2) Insertions caused a \"looping out\" within the alpha-helix. In this case the perturbation was confined to a minimal region in the immediate vicinity of the insertion. No change in the length of the helix was detected in either case. The structural response appears to be determined by the maintenance of the hydrophobic interface between the helix and the rest of the protein. This interface remains essentially intact in all variant structures. The results exemplify the plasticity and the adaptability of the protein structure which allows the incorporation of additional amino acids into a secondary structure element without large structural perturbations, as long as vital internal interactions are preserved. They also suggest that loops in proteins related by evolution can vary in length not only because of insertions within the loops themselves but also as a consequence of insertions within neighboring secondary structure elements.",

        "abstract": "Although beta-sheets represent a sizable fraction of the secondary structure found in proteins, the forces guiding the formation of beta-sheets are still not well understood. Here we examine the folding of a small, all beta-sheet protein, the E. coli major cold shock protein CspA, using both equilibrium and kinetic methods. The equilibrium denaturation of CspA is reversible and displays a single transition between folded and unfolded states. The kinetic traces of the unfolding and refolding of CspA studied by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy are monoexponential and thus also consistent with a two-state model. In the absence of denaturant, CspA refolds very fast with a time constant of 5 ms. The unfolding of CspA is also rapid, and at urea concentrations above the denaturation midpoint, the rate of unfolding is largely independent of urea concentration. This suggests that the transition state ensemble more closely resembles the native state in terms of solvent accessibility than the denatured state. Based on the model of a compact transition state and on an unusual structural feature of CspA, a solvent-exposed cluster of aromatic side chains, we propose a novel folding mechanism for CspA. We have also investigated the possible complications that may arise from attaching polyhistidine affinity tags to the carboxy and amino termini of CspA.",

        "abstract": "A maleimide nitroxide spin-label (MAL-6) linked to a cysteine in the hydrophobic core and a coproporphyrin I (CP) appended on the N-terminus of a synthetic helix-loop-helix peptide ([alpha2]) have been used to examine the designed self-association of a four-helix bundle ([alpha2]2), focusing on the bundle topology and stability and the rotational dynamics of the spin-label. Gel-permeation chromatography demonstrated that the [alpha2] peptide and the peptide modified with a spin-label ([MAL-6-alpha2]), a coproporphyrin ([CP-alpha2]) and a coproporphyrin plus a spin-label ([CP-MAL-6-alpha2]) self-associate into four helix bundles in solution as designed. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra prove that all these peptides are highly alpha-helical, confirmed for [alpha2]2 by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of the two attached maleimide spin-labels in [MAL-6-alpha2]2 shows their effective rotational correlation time (tau(c)) is 7.3 +/- 0.5 ns, consistent with that expected for the tumbling of the four helix bundle itself, indicating the labels are immobilized. The ESR spectra were also unaltered by aqueous-phase paramagnetic ions, Ni(II), demonstrating all of the spin-labels are buried within the hydrophobic core. The lack of spin-spin interaction between the buried, immobilized spin-labels indicates they are remote (> 15 A) from each other, indicating an antiparallel topology of the monomers in [MAL-6-alpha2]2. The parent [alpha2]2 and the modified [MAL-6-alpha2]2 and [CP-alpha2]2 peptides are highly stable (deltaG(H2O) approximately 25 kcal/mol) as investigated by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curves monitored by ESR and CD spectroscopies. Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation leads to a shorter correlation time of the spin-label, tau(c) < 1 ns, approaching that of an unrestricted spin-label in solution. In contrast, trifluoroethanol caused dissociation of [MAL-6-alpha2]2 to yield two [MAL-6-alpha2] monomers with retention of secondary structure and changed the tau(c) to 2.5 +/- 0.5 ns, indicating that a significant degree of motional restriction is imposed on the spin-label by the secondary structure. The coproporphyrin probes covalently attached to the N-termini of [CP-alpha2]2 and [CP-MAL-6-alpha2]2 provided evidence that the helical monomers of both were in a parallel orientation, in contrast to the antiparallel orientation determined for [MAL-6-alpha2]2. Consequently, the ESR spectra of [MAL-6-alpha2]2 and [CP-MAL-6-alpha2]2 reveal major structural differences in the local vicinity of the spin-labels due to the topological difference between these two bundles. The ESR spectra of [CP-MAL-6-alpha2]2 contains two distinct nitroxide populations, indicating that one spin-label remains buried in the hydrophobic core and the other is excluded to solvent in this parallel topology. Alleviation of the steric interactions causing one spin-label in [CP-MAL-6-alpha2]2 to be solvent-exposed by addition of [CP-alpha2]2 results in formation of the heterodimeric [CP-alpha2]/[CP-MAL-6-alpha2], as evidenced by insertion of all the spin-labels into hydrophobic cores. The changes in global topology and local structure as evidenced by this pair of spectral probes have relatively minor effects on the course of guanidine denaturation of these bundles.",

        "abstract": "We have earlier reported that both guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced and heat-induced unfolding of seed coat soybean peroxidase (SBP), monitored by far UV CD, show single step transition. However, although GdnHCl-induced unfolding follows a two-state pathway, the heat-induced denaturation proceeds through intermediates as indicated by the very low cooperativity of transition. In the former case, analysis of the data based on the two-state model gives true thermodynamic parameters, whereas underestimated values are obtained in the latter case. Available complex equations also cannot be applied for the analysis of the thermal unfolding of SBP due to the absence of separate transitions for the intermediates. In the present study, we report a method to obtain true thermodynamic parameters from thermal transition curves of SBP using the two-state model. When SBP is subjected to thermal unfolding at high GdnHCl concentrations (5.8-6.9 M), cooperative behavior is observed, which allowed the analysis by the two-state model to determine their thermodynamic parameters. We then obtained the thermodynamic parameters in the absence of GdnHCl by extrapolating the graph of linear dependence of DeltaH(m) on T(m) to the T(m) corresponding to 0 m GdnHCl. Another key point for checking the validity of our method was the fact that the unfolded state of SBP generated by either heat or GdnHCl is the same by which we could cross-check our results with that obtained from GdnHCl unfolding. Having obtained the true thermodynamic parameters, we report a detailed thermodynamic study of SBP. Further we address the effect of heme in the thermal unfolding mechanism of SBP.",

Intrinsic and ANS fluorescence studies, together with fluorescence quenching by acrylamide, suggested that the hydrophobic patches are more exposed in the denatured conformation. Typical chaperone-like proteins, including alpha- and beta-caseins and alpha-crystalline could inhibit thermal aggregation of CT, and their inhibitory effect was nearly pH-independent (within the pH range of 7-9). This was partially counteracted by alpha-, beta- and especially gamma-cyclodextrins, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions may play a major role. Loss of thermal aggregation at extreme acidic and basic conditions, combined with changes in net charge/pH profile of aggregation upon chemical modification of lysine residues are taken to support concomitant involvement of electrostatic interactions.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding and refolding kinetics of six proline mutants of the human lysozyme (h-lysozyme) were carried out and compared to that of the wild-type protein. Our results show that the slow refolding phase observed in the h-lysozyme refolding kinetics cannot be ascribed to proline isomerization reactions. The h-lysozyme contains two proline residues at positions 71 and 103, both in the trans conformation in the native state. The refolding kinetics of the P71G/P103G mutant, in which both prolines have been replaced by a glycine, were found to be similar to those of the wild-type protein. The same slow phase amplitude of about 10% was found for both proteins, and the slow phase rate constants were also identical within experimental error. Other mutants such as P103G or P71G, in which only one of the two prolines has been replaced by a glycine, and A47P with its three prolines, gave identical slow refolding phases. The X-ray structure analysis and scanning microcalorimetric study of each protein (Herning et al., unpublished experiments) have confirmed that none of the considered mutations affects significantly protein structure and that no major changes in protein stability were brought about by these mutations. Therefore, comparison of the properties of the mutant and wild-type proteins is legitimate. Interestingly, the refolding kinetics of the V110P mutant, in which a proline residue has been introduced at position 110 (N-terminus of an alpha-helix), were clearly triphasic. For this mutant an additional very slow phase with properties similar to those expected from the proline hypothesis was detected. Equilibrium denaturation studies were conducted for each protein, and the refolding pathway of h-lysozyme is partly presented. We also discuss the effect of proline mutations on the energetics of the folding pathway of the h-lysozyme in water.",

Stabilities of the four mutants were measured by calorimetry and by hydrogen exchange. Values of delta delta(WT-->mut), the difference in delta G of folding/unfolding between the wild type and mutant, estimated by both methods are in good agreement and are in the range 4.7-6.0 kcal/mol. There is no general correlation between stability and hydrogen exchange rates at pH 3.5 and 30 degrees C. Exchange occurs by two parallel pathways, one involving small noncooperative fluctuations of the native state, and the other involving cooperative, global unfolding. In the mutant proteins, the rates for exchange by the unfolding mechanism are accelerated by a factor corresponding to the increase in the unfolding/folding equilibrium constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The influence of amino acid substitutions and deletions on the stability of bovine calbindin D9k, the smallest protein known with a pair of EF-hand calcium-binding sites, has been studied using circular dichroism and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. The five modifications are confined to one of the two Ca2+ -binding sites. The Ca2+-loaded forms of the wild-type and mutant calbindins are too stable to be significantly denatured by heating at 90 degrees C or by adding 8 M urea. For the Ca2+-free (apo) forms thermal unfolding appears to be only half complete at 90 degrees C, while denaturation is complete in 7-8 M urea. Four of the mutant proteins show reduced resistance towards unfolding by urea, but one of the modified proteins (Glu-17----Gln) shows an increased stability, presumably because of a reduced electrostatic repulsion in the native state. According to X-ray crystallographic data the OH group of the single tyrosine of calbindin (Tyr-13) is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxyl group of Glu-35, thus linking the two alpha helices flanking the N-terminal Ca2+ site. The pK of ionization of the Tyr-13 hydroxyl group was over 13 for calcium forms of the wild-type protein, between 12.3 and 12.8 for the calcium form of three mutants and between 11.5 and 11.7 for the apoproteins. Significant differences in pH stability between wild type and mutants were observed in the calcium forms, but were not apparent in the apo forms.",

        "abstract": "It was shown previously that the introduction of a negatively charged amino acid at the N-terminus of an alpha-helix could increase the thermostability of phage T4 lysozyme via an electrostatic interaction with the \"helix dipole\" [Nicholson, H., Becktel, W. J., & Matthews, B. W. (1988) Nature 336, 651-656]. The prior report focused on the two stabilizing substitutions Ser 38----Asp (S38D) and Asn 144----Asp (N144D). Two additional examples of stabilizing mutants, T109D and N116D, are presented here. Both show the pH-dependent increase in thermal stability expected for the interaction of an aspartic acid with an alpha-helix dipole. Control mutants were also constructed to further characterize the nature of the interaction with the alpha-helix dipole. High-resolution crystal structure analysis was used to determine the nature of the interaction of the substituted amino acids with the end of the alpha-helix in both the primary and the control mutants. Control mutant S38N has stability essentially the same as that of wild-type lysozyme but hydrogen bonding similar to that of the stabilizing mutant S38D. This confirms that it is the electrostatic interaction between Asp 38 and the helix dipole, rather than a change in hydrogen-bonding geometry, that gives enhanced stability. Structural and thermodynamic analysis of mutant T109N provide a similar control for the stabilizing replacement T109D. In the case of mutant N116D, there was concern that the enhanced stability might be due to a favorable salt-bridge interaction between the introduced aspartate and Arg 119, rather than an interaction with the alpha-helix dipole. The additivity of the stabilities of N116D and R119M seen in the double mutant N116D/R119M indicates that favorable interactions are largely independent of residue 119. As a further control, Asp 92, a presumed helix-stabilizing residue in wild-type lysozyme, was replaced with Asn. This decreased the stability of the protein in the manner expected for the loss of a favorable helix dipole interaction. In total, five mutations have been identified that increase the thermostability of T4 lysozyme and appear to do so by favorable interactions with alpha-helix dipoles. As measured by the pH dependence of stability, the strength of the electrostatic interaction between the charged groups studied here and the helix dipole ranges from 0.6 to 1.3 kcal/mol in 150 mM KCl. In the case of mutants S38D and N144H, NMR titration was used to measure the pKa's of Asp 38 and His 144 in the folded structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "For proteins that contain a disulfide bond, stability is linked thermodynamically to thiol-disulfide exchange. We use this relationship to obtain unfolding free energies for both the reduced and oxidized forms of Escherichia coli thioredoxin from measurements of the effective concentrations of protein thiols. We then evaluate the effect of an amino acid substitution on disulfide bond formation in both the native and denatured states of the protein. Although the Pro-34----Ser substitution in thioredoxin results in a decrease of the effective concentration of protein thiols in the native state, the effective concentration increases in the denatured state. The net effect of the amino acid substitution is to increase the stability of reduced thioredoxin by approximately 2.4 kcal/mol, whereas the stability of the oxidized protein remains the same. By assuming a two-state unfolding equilibrium and a mutation free energy of -7.7 kcal/mol for the Pro-34----Ser substitution in the reduced, urea-unfolded state (based on estimates of solvation and entropic changes), we obtained relative free energies for the native and denatured states of the mutant and wild-type proteins, in both the reduced and oxidized forms.",

        "abstract": "Helix 9 at the C-terminus of class alpha glutathione transferase (GST) polypeptides is a unique structural feature in the GST superfamily. It plays an important structural role in the catalytic cycle. Its contribution toward protein stability/folding as well as the binding of nonsubstrate ligands was investigated by protein engineering, conformational stability, enzyme activity, and ligand-binding methods. The helix9 sequence displays an unfavorable propensity toward helix formation, but tertiary interactions between the amphipathic helix and the GST seem to contribute sufficient stability to populate the helix on the surface of the protein. The helix's stability is enhanced further by the binding of ligands at the active site. The order of ligand-induced stabilization increases from H-site occupation, to G-site occupation, to the simultaneous occupation of H- and G-sites. Ligand-induced stabilization of helix9 reduces solvent accessible hydrophobic surface by facilitating firmer packing at the hydrophobic interface between helix and GST. This stabilized form exhibits enhanced affinity for the binding of nonsubstrate ligands to ligandin sites (i.e., noncatalytic binding sites). Although helix9 contributes very little toward the global stability of hGSTA1-1, its conformational dynamics have significant implications for the protein's equilibrium unfolding/refolding pathway and unfolding kinetics. Considering the high concentration of reduced glutathione in human cells (about 10 mM), the physiological form of hGSTA1-1 is most likely the thiol-complexed protein with a stabilized helix9. The C-terminus region (including helix9) of the class alpha polypeptide appears not to have been optimized for stability but rather for catalytic and ligandin function.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of the disulfide-bond forming enzyme DsbA depends on the very low pKa of a cysteine residue in its active-site and on the relative instability of the oxidized enzyme compared to the reduced one. A thermodynamic cycle has been used to correlate its redox properties to the difference in the free energies of folding (deltadeltaGred/ox) of the oxidized and reduced forms. However, the relation was proved unsatisfied for a number of DsbA variants. In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic and redox properties of a highly destabilized variant DsbA(P151A) (substitution of cis-Pro151 by an alanine) by the means of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (HS-DSC). When the value of deltadeltaGred/ox obtained fluorimetrically for DsbA(P151A) does not correlate with the value expected from its redox potential, the value of deltadeltaGred/ox provided by HS-DSC are in perfect agreement with the predicted thermodynamic cycle for both wild-type and variant. HS-DSC data indicate that oxidized wild-type enzyme and the reduced forms of both wild-type and variant unfold according to a two-state mechanism. Oxidized DsbA(P151A) shows a deviation from two-state behavior that implies the loss of interdomain cooperativity in DsbA caused by Pro151 substitution. The presence of chaotrope in fluorimetric measurements could facilitate domain uncoupling so that the fluorescence probe (Trp76) does not reflect the whole unfolding process of DsbA(P151A) anymore. Thus, theoretical thermodynamic cycle is respected when an appropriate method is applied to DsbA unfolding under conditions in which protein domains still conserve their cooperativity.",

        "abstract": "Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are a group of infectious neurological diseases associated with the structural conversion of an endogenous protein (PrP) in the central nervous system. There are two major forms of this protein: the native and noninfectious cellular form, PrP(C); and the misfolded, infectious, and proteinase K-resistant form, PrP(Sc). The C-terminal domain of PrP(C) is mainly alpha-helical in structure, whereas PrP(Sc) in known to aggregate into an assembly of beta-sheets, forming amyloid fibrils. To identify the regions of PrP(C) potentially involved in the initial steps of the conversion to the infectious conformation, we have used high-resolution NMR spectroscopy to characterize the stability and structure of bovine recombinant PrP(C) (residues 121 to 230) during unfolding with the denaturant urea. Analysis of the 800 MHz (1)H NMR spectra reveals region-specific information about the structural changes occurring upon unfolding. Our data suggest that the dissociation of the native beta-sheet of PrP(C) is a primary step in the urea-induced unfolding process, while strong hydrophobic interactions between helices alpha1 and alpha3, and between alpha2 and alpha3, stabilize these regions even at very high concentrations of urea.",

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding of the Escherichia coli 70 kDa heat shock protein, DnaK, exhibits three well defined transitions. At pH 7.6, these transitions are centered at 45.2, 58.0 and 73.3 degrees C. High sensitivity calorimetric scans as a function of pH indicate that the folding/unfolding behavior is well described by a four-state model which includes a delta H, tm and delta Cp for each state. Calorimetric scans of a 44 kDa N-terminal proteolytic fragment show a major transition centered at 47.5 degrees C (N1) and a minor transition at 79.4 degrees C (N2). A calorimetric scan of a 23 kDa C-terminal proteolytic fragment exhibits a low temperature peak at 58.5 degrees C (C1) and a high temperature peak at 70.6 degrees C (C2). Deconvolution analysis of the low temperature peak reveals that it is actually composed of two transitions of roughly equal delta H centered at 50.4 degrees C (C1a) and 58.2 degrees C(C1b). These experiments have allowed us to assign the transitions of the intact protein as follows. The low temperature transition of DnaK can be assigned to the N-terminal region on the basis of the similarity between the delta H and tm values for the low temperature transition and those obtained for the N1 transition of the isolated N-terminal fragment. This assignment is also supported by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence emission as a function of temperature. DnaK contains a single tryptophan localized at residue 102 in the N-terminal domain of the protein. Additionally, calorimetric scans show that the tm of the low temperature transition increases by 9.2 degrees C in the presence of excess ADP, which is known to bind to the N-terminal domain. The middle transition can be assigned to the C1a and C1b transitions of the C-terminal fragment on the basis of the similarity of delta H and tm. In the intact protein C1a and C1b form a single cooperative unit; however, the cooperative interactions between these folding/unfolding domains are disrupted in the isolated fragment. The high temperature transition of the intact protein is composed of contributions from both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the protein. These studies have allowed us to develop a quantitative model of the folding/unfolding behavior of DnaK.",

The hexameric subunit composition was also evident from electron micrographs, which show a triangular antiprism structure very similar to that of bovine GDH. The enzyme is exceptionally thermostable, with a half-time of inactivation of 3.5 h at 105 degrees C. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed a tm for denaturation of 113 degrees C, and a tm for activation at 60 degrees C. Antigenic cross-reaction with ES4 GDH was observed with the purified GDH from the thermophilic Archaea, Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis as well as with bovine and yeast GDHs. The genome of ES4 was shown to contain a single copy of the gdhA gene, and this was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the GDH from ES4 corresponded to the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence obtained from the pure protein. From the nucleotide sequence the ES4 protein is composed of 420 residues. It has a relatively high hydrophobicity and a low number of sulfur-containing residues compared with mesophilic GDHs. Relatively high homology (52%) exists between the deduced amino acid sequence of ES4 GDH and Clostridium difficile GDH. Of the two distinct families of GDH sequences known, ES4 GDH belongs to the same family as vertebrates, C. difficile, and other Archaea. The gdhA gene of ES4 was expressed in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free lysate, thus providing a system for structural studies of the mechanisms of thermostability in hyper-thermophilic proteins.",

        "abstract": "Tissue factor (TF), a small transmembrane receptor, binds factor VIIa (FVIIa), and the formed complex initiates blood coagulation by proteolytic activation of substrate factors IX and X. A naturally occurring mutation in the human TF gene was recently reported, where a single-base substitution results in an R200W mutation in the TF extracellular domain [Zawadzki, C., Preudhomme, C., Gaveriaux, V., Amouyel, P., and Jude, B. (2002) Thromb. Haemost. 87, 540-541]. This mutation appears to be associated with low monocyte TF expression and may protect against thrombosis but has not been associated with any pathological condition, and individuals who present the heterozygous trait appear healthy. Here, we report the activity, folding, and aggregation behavior of the R200W mutant of the 219-residue soluble extracellular domain of TF (sTF(R200W)) compared to that of the wild-type protein (sTF(wt)). No differences in stability or FVIIa cofactor activity but an impaired ability to promote FX activation at physiological conditions between the sTF(R200W) mutant and sTF(wt) were evident. Increased binding of 1-anilino-8-naphthalene-sulfonic acid (ANS) to sTF(R200W) indicated a population of partially folded intermediates during denaturation. sTF(R200W) showed a dramatically increased propensity for aggregate formation compared to sTF(wt) at mildly acidic pHs, with an increased rate of aggregation during conditions, promoting the intermediate state. The lowered pH resistance could explain the loss of sTF(R200W) in vivo because of aggregation of the mutant. The intrinsic structure of the sTF aggregates appears reminiscent of amyloid fibrils, as revealed by thioflavin T fluorescence, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. We conclude that the lowered activity for FX activation and the propensity of the mutant protein to misfold and aggregate will both contribute to decreased coagulation activity in TF(R200W) carriers, which could protect from thrombotic disease.",

We have characterized the thermodynamics of folding and sequence-specific association with DNA of the MAT alpha 2 homeodomain of yeast. Using differential scanning and isothermal titration calorimetry, we measured the enthalpy, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy changes of these processes. The protein-DNA interaction is enthalpically driven at physiological temperatures. DSC data on the process of melting the protein-DNA complex at different salt concentrations were dissected into its endothermic components, yielding the enthalpy change and dissociation constant of binding. A comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of the free and DNA-bound protein species revealed the formation of additional alpha-helical structure upon binding to DNA. We propose that the latter half of helix 3, the recognition helix, is substantially unfolded in the free protein under the conditions used, as has been observed with other homeodomains [Tsao, D. H. H., et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 15053-15060: Cox, M., et al. (1995) J. Biomol. NMR 5, 23-32]. Formation of protein structure is induced by DNA binding, and the energies measured for association therefore include a component due to folding.",

        "abstract": "An Escherichia coli expression vector, containing the alkaline phosphatase promoter and the stII heat-stable enterotoxin signal sequence, along with the cDNA of the kringle 1 (K1) region of human plasminogen (HPg), has been employed to express into the periplasmic space amino acid residues 82-163 (E163----D) of HPg. This region of the molecule contains the entire K1 domain (residues C84-C162) of HPg, as well as two non-kringle amino-terminal amino acids (S82-E83) that are present in their normal locations in HPg and a carboxyl-terminal amino acid, D163, that results from mutation of the E163, normally present at this location in the HPg amino acid sequence. After purification of r-K1 by chromatographic techniques, we have investigated its omega-amino acid binding properties by titration calorimetry, intrinsic fluorescence, and differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC). The antifibrinolytic agent, epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), possesses a single binding site for r-K1. The thermodynamic properties of this interaction, studied by calorimetric titrations of the heats of binding with this ligand, reveal a Kd of 12 +/- 2 microM at 25 degrees C and pH 7.4, a corresponding delta G of -6.7 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol, a delta H of -3.6 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol, and a delta S of 10.5 +/- 0.8 eu. The intrinsic fluorescence of r-K1 decreases by approximately 44% when its binding site is saturated with EACA, and titrations of this perturbation with EACA lead to calculation of a Kd of approximately 13 microM, a value in good agreement with that obtained from titration calorimetric analysis. EACA represents the strongest binding ligand of a variety of simple aliphatic omega-amino acids examined. A cyclic analogue of EACA, trans-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, interacts with r-K1 with an approximate 12-fold tighter Kd (1.0 +/- 0.2 microM). Investigations by DSC, at pH 7.4, demonstrate that a significant stabilization of the r-K1 structure occurs when EACA binds to this domain. The temperature of maximum heat capacity change (Tm) in the thermal denaturation of r-K1 increases from approximately 340.8 to 359.1 K as a consequence of EACA binding. These studies demonstrate that a fully functional EACA-binding kringle from HPg can be expressed and secreted in E. coli, purified by techniques that do not require refolding, and investigated as an independent structural unit.",

        "abstract": "High-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry has been applied to the study of the reversible thermal unfolding of the lysozyme of T4 bacteriophage in which the threonine residue at position 157 has been replaced by seven different residues. High-resolution structures derived from X-ray crystallography have been reported for these and six other mutants by Alber et al. [Alber, T., Dao-Pin, S., Wilson, K., Wozniak, J. A., Cook, S. P., & Matthews, B. W. (1987) Nature 330, 41-46]. At pH 2.5 the changes relative to the wild-type protein in the standard free energy of unfolding produced by these mutations indicate apparent destabilizations of 0.6 kcal mol-1 (T157R) to 1.9 kcal mol-1 (T157I), whereas the changes in enthalpy of unfolding range from -5.8 kcal mol-1 (T157N) to 11.9 kcal mol-1 (T157E). Since the denaturations are in all cases accompanied by large changes in heat capacity amounting to 2.5 kcal K-1 mol-1, both the free energies and enthalpies are functions of temperature. An intriguing feature of the present results is the relatively large enthalpy changes and the corresponding compensating entropy changes. Our present understanding of the intramolecular energetics of proteins is insufficient to account for these changes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper the thermal denaturation of ribonuclease S, the product of mild digestion of ribonuclease A by subtilisin, is deeply investigated by means of DSC and CD measurements. It results that at whatever pH in the range 4-7.5 the process if fully reversible but not well represented by the simple two-state N<-->D transition. Actually, a two-state model that considers both unfolding and dissociation, NL<-->D + L*, well accounts for the main features of the process: the tail present in the low-temperature side of DSC peaks and the marked dependence of denaturation temperature on protein concentration. This mechanism is strictly linked to the exact stoichiometry of RNase S. An excess of the protein component of RNase S, the so-called S-protein, shifts the system toward a more complex behavior, that deserves a separate treatment in the accompanying paper [Graziano, G., Catanzano, F., Giancola, C., & Barone, G. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 13386-13392]. The thermodynamic analysis leads to the conclusion that the difference in thermal stability between RNase S and RNase A is due to entropic effects, i.e., a greater conformational flexibility of both backbone and side chains in RNase S. The process becomes irreversible at pH 8.0-8.5, probably due to side-reactions occurring at high temperature. Finally, the influence of phosphate ion on the stability of RNase A and RNase S at pH 7.0 is studied and explained in terms of its binding on the active site of ribonuclease. The analysis enables us to obtain an estimate of the apparent association constant and binding enthalpy also.",

        "abstract": "Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in vivo was used to create destabilizing site specific changes at position 6 in iso-1-cytochrome c in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These changes were made in combination with the stabilizing N52I substitution. The resulting proteins showed that a variety of forces and interactions are responsible for these destabilizations. Increasing side chain size was the strongest predictor of decreases in cytochrome c levels in vivo. With intermediate size replacements, increasing hydrophobicity correlated with the proteins' thermostability. Some differences in protein levels in vivo could not be explained by side chain size and hydrophobicity alone. Therefore, specific interactions of individual amino acids may also be involved. The N52I-stabilizing mutation tended to increase the protein levels to the same degree relative to the amino acid at position 6. These stabilized cytochromes had an increased specific activity when compared to the series with the original N52. Strains with these altered cytochromes c showed temperature sensitivities for protein levels and function. Thermodynamic measurements in vivo of the WT (C102A), N52I, G6A, G6A N52I, and G6S N52I correlated with the in vivo data.

Using pressure and temperature as denaturants on a significant number of variants, and by determining the free energy of unfolding at different temperatures, we estimated the stability of variants unable to complete the unfolding transition owing to the experimental conditions required for pressure experiments. The overall set of results allowed us to map the contributions to stability of the hydrophobic core residues of RNase A, with the positions most critical for stability being V54, V57, I106 and V108. We also show that the stability differences can be attributed to both hydrophobic interactions and packing density with an equivalent energetic magnitude. The main hydrophobic core of RNase A is tightly packed, as shown by the small-to-large and isosteric substitutions. In addition, we found that large changes in the number of methylene groups have non-additive positive stability interaction energies that are consistent with exquisite tight core packing and rearrangements of van der Waals' interactions in the protein interior, even after drastic deleterious substitutions.",

The expressed protein, which contains an additional N-terminal methionine residue, has physical and catalytic properties close to those of bovine ribonuclease A. The expressed protein accumulates in inclusion bodies and has scrambled disulfide bonds; the native disulfide bonds are regenerated during purification. Site-directed mutations have been made at each of the two cis proline residues, 93 and 114, and a double mutant has been made. In contrast to results reported for replacement of trans proline residues, replacement of either cis proline is strongly destabilizing. Thermal unfolding experiments on four single mutants give delta Tm approximately equal to 10 degrees C and delta delta G0 (apparent) = 2-3 kcal/mol. The reason is that either the substituted amino acid goes in cis, and cis<==>trans isomerization after unfolding pulls the unfolding equilibrium toward the unfolded state, or else there is a conformational change, which by itself is destabilizing relative to the wild-type conformation, that allows the substituted amino acid to form a trans peptide bond.",

Unfolding of the protein involves a fast and a slow equilibrium, which depend on the degree of protonation of His19 and His33. Both the fast equilibrium between protonated and deprotonated histidines and the slow equilibrium between folded and unfolded protein could be monitored by means of 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The degree of protonation of His19 and His33 appears to be determinant in the unfolding process of the protein. It is shown however that even when the histidines are uncharged, the protein has only limited stability, probably as a result of the presence of all four Glu's of E-L30 in its triple-stranded beta-sheet. At equimolar concentrations of the folded and unfolded form, the rate constant characterizing the transition between these forms is approximately 0.14 s-1. Making use of sequential resonance assignments of the 1H NMR spectrum [van de Ven, F.J.M., & Hilbers, C.W. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 192, 419-441], the fast equilibrium could be interpreted in terms of alterations in the spatial structure of E-L30 in a specific domain of the molecule.

        "abstract": "Residue His119 acts as an acid/base during the cleavage/hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A). In the native enzyme, His119 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp121. This His...Asp dyad is conserved in all homologous pancreatic ribonucleases of known sequence. Yet, replacing Asp121 with an asparagine or alanine residue does not have a substantial effect on either structure or function [Schultz, L. W., Quirk, D. J., and Raines, R. T. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 8886-8898]. Here, the pH dependencies of the conformational stabilities of wild-type RNase A and the D121N, D121A, and H119A variants were determined by monitoring thermal stability over the pH range 1.2-6.0. Replacing Asp121 with an asparagine or alanine residue results in a loss of conformational stability at pH 6.0 of deltadeltaG(o) = 2.0 kcal/mol, from a total of 9.0 kcal/mol. The magnitude of this loss is similar to that to transition-state binding during catalysis. As the pH decreases, the aspartate residue becomes protonated and deltadeltaG(o) decreases. D121N RNase A and D121A RNase A are approximately equivalent in conformational stability. This equivalence arises from compensating changes to enthalpy and entropy. A general analytical method was developed to determine the value of the pKa of a residue in the native and denatured states of a protein by comparing the pH-stability profile of the wild-type protein with that of a variant in which the ionizable residue is replaced with a nonionizable one. Accordingly, Asp121 was found to have pKa values of approximately 2.4 and 3.4 in the native and denatured states, respectively, of wild-type RNase A. This change in pKa can account fully for the differential effects of pH on the conformational stabilities of the wild-type and variant proteins. We conclude that the His...Asp catalytic dyad in pancreatic ribonucleases has two significant roles: (1) to position the proper tautomer of His119 for catalysis and (2) to enhance the conformational stability of the native enzyme. Most enzymic residues contribute to catalysis or stability (or neither). Asp121 of RNase A is a rare example of a residue that contributes equally to both.",

        "abstract": "OCP1 and OCP2, the most abundant proteins in the cochlea, are evidently subunits of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. Although transcribed from a distinct gene, OCP2 is identical to Skp1. OCP1 is equivalent to the F-box protein known as Fbs1, Fbx2, or NFB42 - previously shown to bind N-glycosylated proteins and believed to function in the retrieval and recycling of misfolded proteins. The high concentrations of OCP1 and OCP2 in the cochlea suggest that the OCP1-OCP2 heterodimer may serve an additional function independent of its role in a canonical SCF complex. At 25 degrees C, urea-induced denaturation of OCP1 is slow, but reversible. The data suggest that the protein possesses one or more disordered regions, a conclusion supported by analysis of the far-UV circular dichroism spectrum and the appearance of the (1)H, (15)N-HSQC spectrum. Thermal denaturation of OCP1 is irreversible, evidently due to formation of high molecular weight aggregates. Analysis with a kinetic model yields an estimate for the activation energy for unfolding of 49 kcal/mol. Urea denaturation data for OCP2 returns DeltaG(o) and m values of 6.2 kcal/mol and 1.5 kcal mol(-)(1) M(-1), respectively. In contrast to OCP1, thermal denaturation of OCP2 is reversible. In phosphate-buffered saline, at pH 7.40, the protein exhibits a DeltaH(vH)/DeltaH(cal) ratio of 1.69, suggesting that denaturation proceeds largely from the native dimer directly to the unfolded state. OCP1 and OCP2 associate tightly at room temperature.

In contrast to most amyloid systems, the kinetics became slower with increasing LEN concentrations. At high protein concentrations a significant lag in time was observed between the conformational changes and the formation of fibrils, consistent with the formation of soluble off-pathway oligomeric species and a branched pathway. The presence of off-pathway species was confirmed by small angle x-ray scattering. At low protein concentrations the structural rearrangements were concurrent with fibril formation, indicating the absence of formation of the off-pathway species.

Analyses of solvent and thermal denaturation experiments provide the cardinal thermodynamic parameters, like deltaG, deltaH, deltaS, T(m), and deltaC(p), that characterize the conformational stability for each homologue. The homologue from Bacillus staerothermophilus (BstHPr) was established as the most thermostable homologue and also the homologue with highest deltaG at all temperatures. A good correlation between habitat temperature of the organism and thermal stability of the protein is also seen. Stability curves (deltaG vs T) for every homologue are also reported; these reveal very similar deltaC(p) and temperature of maximum stability (T(S)) values for all HPr homologues. Stability curves show that the higher thermal stability of some homologues is not a result of change in curvature of the curve or a shift to higher temperature, but rather a displacement of the stability curves to higher deltaG values. Stability curves also allowed estimation of deltaG at habitat temperature of the organisms, and we find good agreement between homologues. Electrostatic contributions to stability of each homologue were investigated by measuring stability as a function of varying pH and NaCl concentration, and our results suggest that most HPr homologues share similar electrostatic contributions to stability.",

In nearly all cases, the loss of ATPase activity closely paralleled the temperature dependence of the excess heat capacity. Although the irreversible nature of the denaturation precluded thermodynamic interpretation, a kinetic analysis was feasible. A two-state kinetic model was found to fit the calorimetric data very well. The activation energies of thermal denaturation calculated from calorimetric data were very close to those determined from Arrhenius plots of the apparent first-order rate constants of loss of ATPase activity versus reciprocal of the temperature. The nucleotide binding site occupancy profoundly influenced the temperature at which thermal denaturation occurred. In particular, the temperature at which the maximum in excess heat capacity occurs (Tm) was increased about 8 degrees C by occupancy of tight, noncatalytic ATP binding sites and by an additional 3-4 degrees C by the presence of nucleotides in the medium during heating. The thermal denaturation of CF1, an enzyme composed of nine polypeptide chains, is highly cooperative in that it obeys the simple two-step kinetic model. Since the removal of the epsilon and delta subunits has little effect on thermal denaturation, the major forces that stabilize CF1 must, thus, be between the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits.",

        "abstract": "Inhalational anesthetic agents are known to alter protein function, but the nature of the interactions underlying these effects remains poorly understood. We have used differential scanning calorimetry to study the effects of the anesthetic agent halothane on the thermally induced unfolding transition of bovine serum albumin. We find that halothane (0.6-10 mM) stabilizes the folded state of this protein, increasing its transition midpoint temperature from 62 to 71 degrees C. Binding of halothane to the native state of serum albumin thus outweighs any non-specific interactions between the thermally unfolded state of serum albumin and halothane in this concentration range. Based on the average enthalpy change DeltaH for unfolding of 170 kcal/mol, the increase from 62 to 71 degrees C corresponds to an additional Gibbs energy of stabilization (DeltaDeltaG) due to halothane of more than 4 kcal/mol. Analysis of the dependence of DeltaDeltaG on halothane concentration shows that thermal unfolding of a bovine serum albumin molecule is linked to the dissociation of about one halothane molecule at lower halothane concentrations and about six at higher halothane concentrations. Serum albumin is the first protein that has been shown to be stabilized by an inhalational anesthetic.",

The three alpha subunits are from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and an interspecies hybrid in which the C-terminal domain comes from E. coli (alpha-2 domain) and the N-terminal domain comes from S. typhimurium (alpha-1 domain). Analysis of denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride at 25 degrees C showed that the alpha-2 domain of S. typhimurium was more stable than the alpha-2 domain of E. coli, but the alpha-1 domain of S. typhimurium was less stable than the alpha-1 domain of the E. coli protein; overall, the hybrid protein was slightly less stable than the two original proteins. It is concluded that the stability to guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of each of the domains of the interspecies hybrid is similar to the stability of the domain of the species from which it originated. The E. coli protein was more stable to thermal denaturation than the other proteins near the denaturation temperature, but the order of their thermal stability was reversed at 25 degrees C and coincided with that obtained from guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation.",

        "abstract": "In an effort to relate structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic features in a model macromolecular recognition process, the amino acid residues in the reactive surface of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and surrounding residues were substituted individually by alanine, and the effects of the point-mutations on the kinetics and thermodynamics of inhibition by BPTI toward trypsin and chymotrypsin were investigated. Fifteen alanine mutants were produced. The majority of the BPTI mutants exhibited a binding affinity similar to that of the wild-type protein. The exceptions were the primary specificity site (PI) mutant and those mutants that seem to have nonlocal perturbations of structure, as revealed by circular dichroism and thermostability measurements. The mutation at the P1 site caused a reduction in the binding free energy of 10 and 1.8 kcal mol-1 for trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. The losses in binding affinity were determined almost exclusively by an increase in the dissociation rate constant. However, the rate of association of the P1 mutant, Lys-15-Ala, with trypsin was also drastically reduced (> 200-fold). Calorimetric measurements of the heats of binding for the association of chymotrypsin with the wild-type inhibitor and its alanine mutants allowed determination of the relative contributions of the changes in enthalpy and entropy to the free energy of binding. Compensatory changes in the two parameters were observed in several cases, which were attributed to desolvation effects at the binding interface.",

        "abstract": "The biological activity of some proteins is known to be sensitive to oxidative damage caused by a variety of oxidants. The model protein staphylococcal nuclease was used to explore the effect on protein structural stability of oxidizing methionine to the sulfoxide form. These effects were compared with the effects of substituting methionines with isoleucine and leucine, a potential strategy for stabilizing proteins against oxidative damage. Wild-type nuclease and various mutants were oxidized with hydrogen peroxide. Stabilities of both oxidized and unoxidized proteins were determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. Oxidation destabilized the wild-type protein by over 4 kcal/mol. This large loss of stability supports the idea that in some cases loss of biological activity is linked to disruption of the protein native state. Comparison of mutant protein's stability losses upon oxidation showed that methionines 65 and 98 had a much greater destabilizing effect when oxidized than methionines 26 or 32. While substitution of methionine 98 carried as great an energetic penalty as oxidation, substitution at position 65 was less disruptive than oxidation. Thus a simple substitution mutagenesis strategy to protect a protein against oxidative destabilization is practical for some methionine residues.",

        "abstract": "Similar to other proteins of the periplasm of Escherichia coli, TEM 1 beta-lactamase contains only a single disulfide bond. It can fold to its native conformation in both the presence and the absence of this disulfide bond. The GdmC1-dependent equilibrium unfolding of beta-lactamase in vitro is well described by a N reversible I reversible U three-state model in which the native protein (N) first reacts to an intermediate of the molten globule type (I) and then to the unfolded state (U). We find that the disulfide bond of beta-lactamase stabilizes I relative to U, but does not change the stability of N relative to I. The I reversible U transition is an extremely rapid reaction for both reduced and oxidized beta-lactamase, but the N reversible I folding kinetics are slow and identical in the presence and the absence of the disulfide bond. This insensitivity of the N reversible I equilibrium and kinetics suggests that the region around the disulfide bond is already native-like folded and is presumably buried in the intermediate I, prior to the slow and rate-limiting events of folding. This was confirmed by measuring the stability of the disulfide bond, which, to a first approximation, is identical in N and I. In native, reduced beta-lactamase, the thiol groups are inaccessible for oxidation by DsbA, but at the stage of the molten globule intermediate I oxidation is still possible, because I is in fast exchange with the unfolded protein U. The introduction of the disulfide bond into beta-lactamase by DsbA competes with conformational folding at the stage of the final slow steps in the folding of the reduced protein. The major problem in the oxidation of proteins with one or two disulfide bonds (such as beta-lactamase) is not the formation of incorrect disulfide bonds, but the premature burial of the thiol groups by the rapid conformational folding of the reduced protein. DsbA, the major thiol/ disulfide isomerase of the bacterial periplasm, meets this problem. It is a very strong oxidant, and its reaction with cysteine residues in unfolded proteins is extremely fast.",

Here we show that upon heating, purified P22 procapsids release their scaffolding protein subunits, and the coat protein lattice expands in the absence of any other cellular or viral components. Following these processes by differential scanning calorimetry revealed four different transitions that correlated with structural transitions in the coat protein shells. Exit of scaffolding protein from the procapsid occurred reversibly and just above physiological temperature. Expansion of the procapsid lattice, which was exothermic, occurred after the release of scaffolding protein. Partial denaturation of coat subunits within the intact shell structure was detected prior to the major endothermic event. This major endotherm occurred above 80 degrees C and represents particle breakage and irreversible coat protein denaturation. The results indicate that the coat subunits are designed to form a metastable precursor lattice, which appears to be separated from the mature lattice by a kinetic barrier.",

        "abstract": "Bacteriophage T4 lysozyme is a basic molecule with an isoelectric point above 9.0, and an excess of nine positive charges at neutral pH. It might be expected that it would be energetically costly to bring these out-of-balance charges from the extended, unfolded, form of the protein into the compact folded state. To determine the contribution of such long-range electrostatic interactions to the stability of the protein, five positively charged surface residues, Lys16, Arg119, Lys135, Lys147 and Arg154, were individually replaced with glutamic acid. Eight selected double, triple and quadruple mutants were also constructed so as to sequentially reduce the out-of-balance formal charge on the molecule from +9 to +1 units. Each of the five single variant proteins was crystallized and high-resolution X-ray analysis confirmed that each mutant structure was, in general, very similar to the wild-type. In the case of R154E, however, the Arg154 to Glu replacement caused a rearrangement in which Asp127 replaced Glu128 as the capping residue of a nearby alpha-helix. The thermal stabilities of all 13 variant proteins were found to be fairly similar, ranging from 0.5 kcal/mol more stable than wild-type to 1.7 kcal/mol less stable than wild-type. In the case of the five single charge-change variants, for which the structures were determined, the changes in stability can be rationalized in terms of changes in local interactions at the site of the replacement. There is no evidence that the reduction in the out-of-balance charge on the molecule increases the stability of the folded relative to the unfolded form, either at pH 2.8 or at pH 5.3. This indicates that long-range electrostatic interactions between the substituted amino acid residues and other charged groups on the surface of the molecule are weak or non-existent. Furthermore, the relative stabilities of the multiple charge replacement mutant proteins were found to be almost exactly equal to the sums of the relative stabilities of the constituent single mutant proteins. This also clearly indicates that the electrostatic interactions between the replaced charges are negligibly small. The activities of the charge-change mutant lysozymes, as measured by the rate of hydrolysis of cell wall suspensions, are essentially equal to that of the wild-type lysozyme, but on a lysoplate assay the mutant enzymes appear to have higher activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Equilibrium stability was determined by urea denaturation at various pH and temperature values. Unfolding and refolding rates were measured over a range of urea concentrations. The data from the equilibrium and kinetic studies fit a simple two-state model, except at lower urea concentrations, where the folding kinetics indicate a transient intermediate. Unfolding is very slow, with a half-life of about 2 h in 8 M urea at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C. Comparison of the urea dependence of the folding kinetics and equilibrium indicates the protein undergoes 93% of its total change in solvent exposure on going from the unfolded state to the transition state. Thus, the transition state is quite compact. The presence of dithiothreitol destabilized the protein by 7 kcal/mol, indicating the presence of an unusually strong disulfide linkage between the two cysteines in the molecule. Protein stability is dramatically reduced at alkaline pH values; this can be attributed to a titratable shift (pKa = 7.8) in the slope of the urea dependence of unfolding.",

        "abstract": "The CUB domain is a widespread 110-amino-acid module found in functionally diverse, often developmentally regulated proteins, for which an antiparallel beta-barrel topology similar to that in immunoglobulin V domains has been predicted. Spermadhesins have been proposed as a subgroup of this protein family built up by a single CUB domain architecture. To test the proposed structural model, we have analyzed the structural organization of two members of the spermadhesin protein family, porcine seminal plasma proteins I/II (PSP-I/PSP-II) heterodimer and bovine acidic seminal fluid protein (aSFP) homodimer, using differential scanning calorimetry, far-ultraviolet circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Thermal unfolding of PSP-I/PSP-II and aSFP were irreversible and followed a one-step process with transition temperatures (Tm) of 60.5 degrees C and 78.6 degrees C, respectively. The calorimetric enthalpy changes (delta Hcat) of thermal denaturation were 439 kJ/mol for PSP-I/PSP-II and 660 kJ/mol for aSFP dimer. Analysis of the calorimetric curves of PSP-I/PSP-II showed that the entire dimer constituted the cooperative unfolding unit. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and deconvolution of circular dichroic spectra using a convex constraint analysis indicated that beta-structure and turns are the major structural element of both PSP-I/PSP-II (53% of beta-sheet, 21% of turns) and aSFP (44% of beta-sheet, 36% of turns), and that the porcine and the bovine proteins contain little, if any, alpha-helical structure. Taken together, our results indicate that the porcine and the bovine spermadhesin molecules are probably all-beta-structure proteins, and would support a beta-barrel topology like that predicted for the CUB domain. Other beta-structure folds, such as the Greek-key pattern characteristic of many carbohydrate-binding protein domains cannot be eliminated. Finally, the same combination of biophysical techniques was used to characterize the residual secondary structure of thermally denatured forms of PSP-I/PSP-II and aSFP, and to emphasize the aggregation tendency of these forms.",

The parent proteins differ at 40 positions in the sequence of 268 amino acids, and the hybrids differ by up to 15 amino acids from the Escherichia coli alpha subunit.

The mutants Val61Tyr, Val61Glu, Val61His, and Val61Lys exhibit electronic spectra identical to that of the wild type, suggesting that mutation at Val61 did not affect the overall protein structure significantly. The redox potentials determined by differential pulse voltammetry were -10 (wild type), -25 (Val61Glu), -33 (Val61Tyr), 12 (Val61His), and 17 mV (Val61Lys) versus NHE. The thermal stabilities and urea-mediated denaturation of wild-type cytochrome b(5) and its mutants were in the following order: wild type > Val61Glu > Val61Tyr > Val61His > Val61Lys. The kinetics of denaturation of cytochrome b(5) by urea was also analyzed. The first-order rate constants of heme transfer between cytochrome b(5) and apomyoglobin at 20 +/- 0.2 degrees C were 0.25 +/- 0.01 (wild type), 0.42 +/- 0.02 (Val61Tyr), 0.93 +/- 0.04 (Val61Glu), 2.88 +/- 0.01 (Val61His), and 3.88 +/- 0.02 h(-)(1) (Val61Lys). The crystal structure of Val61His was determined using the molecular replacement method and refined at 2.1 A resolution, showing that the imidazole side chain of His61 points away from the heme-binding pocket and extends into the solvent, the coordination distances from Fe to NE2 atoms of two axial ligands are approximately 0.6 A longer than the reported value, and the hydrogen bond network involving Val61, the heme propionates, and three water molecules no longer exists. We conclude that the conserved residue Val61 is located at one of the key positions, the \"electrostatic potential\" around the heme-exposed area and the hydrophobicity of the heme pocket are determinant factors modulating the redox potential of cytochrome b(5), and the hydrogen bond network around the exposed heme edge is also an important factor affecting the heme stability.",

A three-state equation is derived which relates the stability of three different conformations of apomyoglobin (native [N], unfolded [U], and intermediate [I]) as a function of urea and of pH. This equation fits our data reasonably well. The parameters which give the best fit have both thermodynamic and structural implications for N, I, and U. Specifically, I is closer in Gibbs energy to U than to N, indicating that side-chain packing results in much of the stability of native protein structure. The equilibria between N and I and between I and U are equally sensitive to urea, suggesting that much of the surface of I is inaccessible to solvent. The acid-induced transition in which N unfolds can be described as the result of titration of approximately two histidines with low pKaS in N.

This study addresses this question by making a series of single substitution mutations in the model protein staphylococcal nuclease. These mutants have had a residue capable of participating in hydrogen bonding either removed or introduced. The variants we have investigated are as follows: nine valines substituted with threonine and serine; eight threonines converted to valine, serine, and cysteine; and seven tyrosines replaced by phenylalanine and leucine. The stabilities of these 56 mutant proteins were determined by titration with guanidine hydrochloride using fluorescence as a probe of structure. In general, it was found that the stability effects of removing a hydrogen bonding residue and replacing it with a nonbonding residue were relatively small. This was true even in the case of buried residues participating in hydrogen bonds, where the substituted residue leaves an unfulfilled hydrogen bond in the hydrophobic core. In contrast, introducing a hydrogen bonding residue in place of a nonbonding residue was generally more costly energetically. A wide variability in the cost of burying a hydroxyl was observed, but this does not seem to be due to differences in hydrogen bonding. The overall energetic contribution of various wild-type hydrogen bonding interactions was evaluated as being favorable. A range of energies from approximately 1.5 to 4.0 kcal/mol was estimated for the contribution of these interactions to the stability of the native state.",

        "abstract": "The X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions in the SH2D1A gene that encodes an SH2 domain protein named SH2D1A or SAP. The identification of a number of missense mutations within the protein's SH2 domain, each of which can directly cause disease, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the function of an interaction protein module, SH2, in the pathogenesis of XLP. We show here that SAP mutants found in XLP patients are defective in binding its physiological ligands signaling lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAM), a co-receptor in T cell activation, and Fyn, a Src family protein tyrosine kinase. Consequently, these mutants are deficient in signaling through the SLAM receptor. This is reflected by compromised abilities for the mutants to recruit Fyn to SLAM and to activate Fyn, by reduced phosphorylation of the receptor, and by deficiencies for the mutants in blocking binding of SHP-2 to SLAM. Furthermore, all mutants examined are defective in protein folding as manifested by their significantly reduced melting temperatures upon thermal denaturation, compared to that of SAP. Taken together, these results suggest that defects in ligand binding, receptor signaling, and protein folding collectively contribute to the loss of function for disease-causing SAP mutants.",

        "abstract": "Bovine alpha-lactalbumin has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry with various concentrations of calcium to elucidate the effect of this ligand on its thermal properties. In the presence of excess calcium, alpha-lactalbumin unfolds upon heating with a single heat-absorption peak and a significant increase of heat capacity. Analysis of the observed heat effect shows that this temperature-induced process closely approximates a two-state transition. The transition temperature increases in proportion with the logarithm of the calcium concentration, which results in an increase in the transition enthalpy as expected from the observed heat capacity increment of denaturation. As the total concentration of free calcium in solution is decreased below that of the proteins, there are two temperature-induced heat absorption peaks whose relative area depends on the calcium concentration, such that further decrease of calcium concentration results in a increase of the low-temperature peak and a decrease of the high-temperature one. The high-temperature peak occurs at the same temperature as the unfolding of the holo-protein, while the low-temperature peak is within the temperature range associated with the unfolding of the apo-protein. Statistical thermodynamic modeling of this process shows that the bimodal character of the thermal denaturation of bovine alpha-lactalbumin at non-saturated calcium concentrations is due to a high affinity of Ca2+ for alpha-lactalbumin and a low rate of calcium exchange between the holo- and apo-forms of this protein. Using calorimetric data, the calcium-binding constant for alpha-lactalbumin has been determined to be 2.9 x 10(8) M-1.",

        "abstract": "An analysis of the pairwise side-chain packing geometries of cysteine residues observed in high-resolution protein crystal structures indicates that cysteine pairs have pronounced orientational preferences due to the geometric constraints of disulfide bond formation. A potential function was generated from these observations and used to evaluate models for novel disulfide bonds in human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII). Three double-cysteine variants of HCAII were purified and the effective concentrations of their thiol groups were determined by titrations with glutathione and dithiothreitol. The effects of the cysteine mutations on the native state structure and stability were characterized by circular dichroism, enzymatic activity, sulfonamide binding, and guanidine hydrochloride titration. These analyses indicate that the PAIRWISE potential is a good predictor of the strength of the disulfide bond itself, but the overall structural and thermodynamic effects on the protein are complicated by additional factors. In particular, the effects of cysteine substitutions on the native state and the stabilization of compact nonnative states by the disulfide can override any stabilizing effect of the cross-link.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium and kinetic studies on the folding of a series of amino acid replacements at position 211 in the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase from Escherichia coli were performed in order to determine the role of this position in the rate-limiting step in folding. Previous studies [Beasty, A. M., Hurle, M. R., Manz, J. T., Stackhouse, T., Onuffer, J. J., & Matthews, C. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 2965-2974] have shown that the rate-limiting step corresponds to the association/dissociation of the amino (residues 1-188) and carboxy (residues 189-268) folding units. In terms of the secondary structure, the amino folding unit consists of the first six strands and five alpha helices of this alpha/beta barrel protein. The carboxy folding unit comprises the remaining two strands and three alpha helices; position 211 is in strand 7. Replacement of the wild-type glycine at position 211 with serine, valine, and tryptophan at most alters the rate of dissociation of the folding units; association is not changed significantly. In contrast, glutamic acid and arginine dramatically decelerate and accelerate, respectively, both association and dissociation. The difference in effects is attributed to long-range electrostatic interactions for these charged side chains; steric effects and/or hydrogen bonding play lesser roles. When considered with previous data on replacements at other positions in the alpha subunit [Hurle, M. R., Tweedy, N. B., & Matthews, C. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 6356-6360], it is clear that beta strands 6 (in the amino folding unit) and 7 (in the carboxy folding unit and containing position 211) dock late in the folding process.",

Crystallographic studies have suggested the importance of the amino acids Thr-40, Arg-106, Arg-126 and Tyr-128 for the hydrogen bonding network of the fatty acid carboxylate group. Two phenylalanines at 16 and 57 are positioned to interact with the acyl chain of the fatty acid. We prepared 13 mutant proteins by site-directed mutagenesis and tested them for fatty acid binding and stability. Substitution of amino acids Phe-16, Arg-106 or Arg-126 created proteins which showed a large decrease in or complete loss of oleic acid binding. Substitution of Phe-57 by Ser or Val and of Tyr-128 by Phe had no great effect. The stability of the mutant proteins was tested by denaturation studies on the basis of fatty acid binding or tryptophan fluorescence and compared with that of the wild-type M-FABP. There was no direct relationship between fatty acid-binding activity and stability. Less stable mutants (F57S and Y128F) did not show a marked change in fatty acid-binding activity. Substitution of Arg-126 by Gln or Arg-106 by Thr eliminated binding activity, but the former mutant protein showed wild-type stability, in contrast to the latter.

Thermal denaturation of Xys1L reveals three thermodynamically independent domains, and that of Xys1S, which is a proteolytic fragment of Xys1L (without a C-terminal part), reveals two thermodynamically independent domains, each of which follows a two-state thermal unfolding process under our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the thermodynamic parameters of unfolding for each domain do not fit some of the correlations obtained for most compact globular proteins. It is known that if delta Hres(T) and delta Sres(T) are plotted against temperature for a number of water-soluble compact globular proteins, they all have a common value at approximately 110 degrees C (383 K). Calculation of the variations in the enthalpy and entropy of unfolding per residue for each domain of xylanase with temperature gave us delta Hres(383) and delta Sres(383) values of approximately 3 kcal/(mol of residue) and 9 cal/(K.mol of residue), respectively. This is practically 2-fold larger than those apparent for most medium-sized globular protein values.

One promising candidate is barley chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 (CI-2), a plant protein that has been extensively characterized with respect to structure and function. Based on the tertiary structure of wild-type (WT) CI-2, five mutants with lysine contents ranging from 20 to 25 mol percent were designed, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by ion exchange and gel permeation chromatography. Inasmuch as previous transgenic experiments suggested that proper folding and stability may be essential for in vivo accumulation of the engineered proteins in plant cells, we first undertook an in vitro study of the conformation and thermodynamic stability of the CI-2 mutants in order to select an ideal candidate for plant expression. Mutant and WT CI-2 proteins had similar circular dichroism spectra, suggesting similar secondary structures. However, differences in the accessibility of the sole tryptophan residue, Trp24, indicated that the local conformation differed among the mutants. The thermodynamic stability of the mutants ranged from <2 to 4.9 kcal/mol compared with approximately 7 kcal/mol for the wild-type protein. In conjunction with proteolytic stability studies, we have identified one mutant that has the potential to be expressed in a stable manner in plant cells.",

These prototype domains unfold fully reversibly, even when the conserved structural disulfide bridge is reduced. This has allowed us to probe the factors that limit the expression yield of soluble immunoglobulin domains in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm (intrabodies). The most important factor is thermodynamic stability, and there is an excellent quantitative correlation between stability and yield. Surprisingly, an unprocessed N-terminal methionine residue can severely compromise VL stability, but this problem can be overcome by changing the amino acid following the initiator methionine residue. Transcription from the strong T7 promoter does not increase the amount of soluble material over that obtained from the tetA promoter, but large amounts of inclusions bodies can be obtained. Elevated temperature shifts protein from a productive folding pathway to aggregation. The structural disulfide bridge does not form in the cytoplasm, but the two consensus cysteine residues can be quantitatively oxidized in vitro. In summary, stability engineering provides a plannable route to the high-yield cytoplasmic expression of functional intrabody domains.",

        "abstract": "Neurotransmission relies on synaptic vesicles fusing with the membrane of nerve cells to release their neurotransmitter content into the synaptic cleft, a process requiring the assembly of several members of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family. SNAREs represent an evolutionarily conserved protein family that mediates membrane fusion in the secretory and endocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells. On membrane contact, these proteins assemble in trans between the membranes as a bundle of four alpha-helices, with the energy released during assembly being thought to drive fusion. However, it is unclear how the energy is transferred to the membranes and whether assembly is conformationally linked to fusion. Here, we report the X-ray structure of the neuronal SNARE complex, consisting of rat syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin 2, with the carboxy-terminal linkers and transmembrane regions at 3.4 A resolution. The structure shows that assembly proceeds beyond the already known core SNARE complex, resulting in a continuous helical bundle that is further stabilized by side-chain interactions in the linker region.

All the circularly permuted G-CSFs (cpG-CSFs) were able to fold into biologically active structures that could recognize the G-CSF receptor. CD and NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that all of the cpG-CSFs adopted a fold similar to that of the native molecule, except for one [cpG-CSF(L1)[142/141]] which has the new termini at the end of loop 34 with the shorter L1 linker. All of the cpG-CSFs underwent cooperative unfolding by urea, and a systematically lower free energy change (DeltaGurea) was observed for molecules with the shorter L1 linker than for those molecules in which the original termini were directly linked (the L0 linker). The thermodynamic stability of the cpG-CSFs toward urea was found to correlate with their relative ability to stimulate proliferation of G-CSF responsive cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the G-CSF sequence is robust in its ability to undergo linear rearrangement and adopt a biologically active conformation. The choice of linker, with its effect on stability, seems to be important for realizing the full biological activity of the three-dimensional structure. The breakpoint and linker together are the ultimate determinants of the structural and biological profiles of these circularly permuted cytokines. In the following paper [McWherter, C. A., et al.

        "abstract": "The type 1 human immunodeficiency virus presents a conical capsid formed by several hundred units of the capsid protein, CA. Homodimerization of CA occurs via its C-terminal domain, CA-C. This self-association process, which is thought to be pH-dependent, seems to constitute a key step in virus assembly. CA-C isolated in solution is able to dimerize. An extensive thermodynamic characterization of the dimeric and monomeric species of CA-C at different pHs has been carried out by using fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), absorbance, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Thermal and chemical denaturation allowed the determination of the thermodynamic parameters describing the unfolding of both CA-C species. Three reversible thermal transitions were observed, depending on the technique employed. The first one was protein concentration-dependent; it was observed by FTIR and NMR, and consisted of a broad transition occurring between 290 and 315 K; this transition involves dimer dissociation. The second transition (Tm approximately 325 K) was observed by ANS-binding experiments, fluorescence anisotropy, and near-UV CD; it involves partial unfolding of the monomeric species. Finally, absorbance, far-UV CD, and NMR revealed a third transition occurring at Tm approximately 333 K, which involves global unfolding of the monomeric species. Thus, dimer dissociation and monomer unfolding were not coupled. At low pH, CA-C underwent a conformational transition, leading to a species displaying ANS binding, a low CD signal, a red-shifted fluorescence spectrum, and a change in compactness. These features are characteristic of molten globule-like conformations, and they resemble the properties of the second species observed in thermal unfolding.",

By analyzing FKBP12, an alpha/beta-protein that folds with two-state kinetics, we have been able to address three key questions concerning the use of TFE. First, does TFE perturb the folding pathway? Second, can the observed changes in the rate of folding and unfolding in TFE be attributed to a change in free energy of a single state? Finally, can TFE be used to infer information on secondary structure formation in the transition state? Protein engineering experiments on FKBP12, coupled with folding and unfolding experiments in 0% and 9.6% TFE, conclusively show that TFE does not perturb the folding pathway of this protein. Our results also suggest that the changes in folding and unfolding rates observed in 9.6% TFE are due to a global effect of TFE on the protein, rather than the stabilization of any elements of secondary structure in the transition state. Thus, studies with TFE and other co-solvents can be accurately interpreted only when combined with other techniques.",

However, results from experiments performed at two different scanning rates suggest that interpretation of data in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics is not unreasonable. For papain, the ratio of calorimetric (delta Hcal) to van't Hoff (delta HvH) enthalpies approximated to 2.0. This value indicates that papain domains unfold almost independently, as it has been reported previously. In contrast, chymopapain displayed a more cooperative behavior with a delta Hcal to delta HvH ratio of 1.3-1.4. DSC curves were analyzed in terms of a mechanism that includes domain-domain interactions. The results showed a negligible interdomain free energy in the case of papain, but a significant value of approx. 1.0 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) for chymopapain.

The midpoint temperature for the transition between the folded and folded states, T(m), of the hemopexin-ferriheme complex exhibits a significant dependence on pH. When the pH is reduced from 7 to 5 (50 mM BisTris buffer and 50 mM NaCl), T(m) decreases by approximately 23 degrees C despite the relatively higher chloride concentration that tends to stabilize the protein. The thermal stability of the hemopexin-ferroheme complex was examined at pH 7.4 to yield a T(m) that is 3.2 degrees C lower than that of the hemopexin-ferriheme complex under identical conditions. The effect of transition metal ions, which hemopexin has recently been shown to bind [Mauk, M. R., Rosell, F. I., Lelj-Garolla, B., Moore, G. R., and Mauk, A. G.

These metal ions also interfered significantly with the recovery of the native state from the unfolded protein when the protein on returning to 20 degrees C. The current results demonstrate how the conditions within the endosomes of hepatocytes (pH approximately 5.0, [Cl(-)] approximately 60 mM) and the potential presence of transition metal ions or heme iron reduction contribute to the membrane receptor-mediated process of heme release from hemopexin.",

        "abstract": "We have measured the stability and stoichiometry of variants of the human p53 tetramerization domain to assess the effects of mutation on homo- and hetero-oligomerization. The residues chosen for mutation were those in the hydrophobic core that we had previously found to be critical for its stability but are not conserved in human p73 or p51 or in p53-related proteins from invertebrates or vertebrates. The mutations introduced were either single natural mutations or combinations of mutations present in p53-like proteins from different species. Most of the mutations were substantially destabilizing when introduced singly. The introduction of multiple mutations led to two opposite effects: some combinations of mutations that have occurred during the evolution of the hydrophobic core of the domain in p53-like proteins had additive destabilizing effects, whereas other naturally occurring combinations of mutations had little or no net effect on the stability, there being mutually compensating effects of up to 9.5 kcal/mol of tetramer. The triple mutant L332V/F341L/L344I, whose hydrophobic core represents that of the chicken p53 domain, was nearly as stable as the human domain but had impaired hetero-oligomerization with it. Thus, engineering of a functional p53 variant with a reduced capacity to hetero-oligomerize with wild-type human p53 can be achieved without any impairment in the stability and subunit affinity of the engineered homo-oligomer.",

        "abstract": "Bergerac-type chimeras of spectrin SH3 were designed by extending a beta-hairpin by eight amino acids so that the extension protruded from the domain body like a \"nose\" being exposed to the solvent. A calorimetric study of several Bergerac-SH3 variants was carried out over a wide range of pH values and protein concentrations and the three-dimensional structure of one of them, SHH, was determined. X-ray studies confirmed that the nose had a well defined beta-structure whilst the chimera formed a stable tetramer within the crystal unit because of four tightly packed noses. In the pH range of 4-7 the heat-induced unfolding of some chimeras was complex and concentration dependent, whilst at pH values below 3.5, low protein concentrations of all the chimeras studied, including SHH, seemed to obey a monomolecular two-state unfolding model. The best set of data was obtained for the SHA variant, the unfolding heat effects of which were systematically higher than those of the WT protein (about 16.4 kJ/mol at 323 K), which may be close to the upper limit of the enthalpy gain due to 10 residue beta-hairpin folding. At the same time, the chimeras with high nose stability, which, like SHH, have a hydrophobic (IVY) cluster on their surface, showed a lower apparent unfolding heat effect, much closer to that of the WT protein. The possible reasons for this difference are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase contains two tryptophans, both situated in the carboxy-terminal domain, and seven tyrosines, five in the amino-terminal domain, one in the domain-domain interface, and one in the carboxy-terminal domain. Site-specific mutagenesis has been used to construct two single-tryptophan mutants and one no-tryptophan mutant by replacing one or both native tryptophans, W308 and W333, with phenylalanines. The mutations have been shown to have a relatively small effect on the overall structure and enzymatic properties of the mutants. Both tryptophans are quenched in the folded state. The steady-state emission spectra and tryptophan quantum yields are the same in the single-tryptophan mutants and in the wild-type protein. Large changes in the tryptophan emission maxima and steady-state emission intensities are observed upon unfolding. Far-UV circular dichroism and steady-state as well as time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy have been used to monitor the equilibrium unfolding transitions of these mutants and wild-type PGK. For each protein, the transitions followed by CD and steady-state fluorescence are nearly coincident, suggesting that the structural changes monitored by local fluorescence probes and ellipticity changes, which are sensitive to the changes in the overall structure, report a single cooperative transition, consistent with a two-state unfolding mechanism. Both tryptophans have three lifetimes, which follow a similar pattern as a function of denaturant concentration. The amplitude terms associated with the two longer lifetimes increase with unfolding while the short lifetime amplitude decreases. It thus appears that these population amplitudes represent markers for the unfolded and folded states, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "Importance of contact persistence in denatured state loop formation: kinetic insights into sequence effects on nucleation early in folding.", 
        "abstract": "Protein folding is dependent on the formation and persistence of simple loops early in folding. Ease of loop formation and persistence is believed to be dependent on the steric interactions of the residues involved in loop formation. We have previously investigated this factor in the denatured state of iso-1-cytochrome c using a five-amino-acid insert in front of a unique histidine in the N-terminal region of the protein. Previously, we reported that the apparent pK(a) values of loop formation for the most flexible (all Gly) and least flexible (all Ala) insert were, within error, the same. We evaluate whether this observation is due to differences in the persistence of loop contacts or due to effects of local sequence sterics and main-chain hydration on the persistence length of the chain. We also test whether sequence order affects loop formation. Here, we report kinetic results coupled to further mutagenesis of the insert to discern between these possibilities. We find that the amino acid-glycine versus alanine-next to the loop forming histidine has a dominant effect on loop kinetics and equilibria. A glycine in this position speeds loop breakage relative to alanine, resulting in less stable loops. At high percentage of Gly in the insert, rates of loop formation and breakage exactly compensate, leading to a leveling out in loop stability. Loop formation rates also increase with glycine content, inconsistent with poly-Gly segments being more extended than previously suspected due to main-chain hydration or local sterics. Unlike loop breakage rates, loop formation rates are insensitive to local sequence. Together, these observations suggest that contact persistence plays a more important role in defining the \"folding code\" than rates of loop formation.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium behaviour of the bovine phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) has been studied under various conditions of pH, temperature and urea concentration. Far-UV and near-UV CD, fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies indicate that, in its native state, PEBP is mainly composed of beta-sheets, with Trp residues mostly localized in a hydrophobic environment; these results suggest that the conformation of PEBP in solution is similar to the three-dimensional structure determined by X-ray crystallography. The pH-induced conformational changes show a transition midpoint at pH 3.0, implying nine protons in the transition. At neutral pH, the thermal denaturation is irreversible due to protein precipitation, whereas at acidic pH values the protein exhibits a reversible denaturation. The thermal denaturation curves, as monitored by CD, fluorescence and differential scanning calorimetry, support a two-state model for the equilibrium and display coincident values with a melting temperature Tm = 54 degrees C, an enthalpy change DeltaH = 119 kcal.mol-1 and a free energy change DeltaG(H2O, 25 degrees C) = 5 kcal.mol-1. The urea-induced unfolding profiles of PEBP show a midpoint of the two-state unfolding transition at 4.8 M denaturant, and the stability of PEBP is 4.5 kcal.mol-1 at 25 degrees C. Moreover, the surface active properties indicate that PEBP is essentially a hydrophilic protein which progressively unfolds at the air/water interface over the course of time. Together, these results suggest that PEBP is well-structured in solution but that its conformation is weakly stable and sensitive to hydrophobic conditions: the PEBP structure seems to be flexible and adaptable to its environment.",

        "abstract": "A procedure has been developed for the isolation and identification of mutants in the bacterial serine protease subtilisin that exhibit enhanced thermal stability. The cloned subtilisin BPN' gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was treated with bisulfite, a chemical mutagen that deaminates cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA. Strains containing the cloned, mutagenized subtilisin gene which produced subtilisin with enhanced thermal stability were selected by a simple plate assay procedure which screens for esterase activity on nitrocellulose filters after preincubation at elevated temperatures. One thermostable subtilisin variant, designated 7150, has been fully characterized and found to differ from wild-type subtilisin by a single substitution of Ser for Asn at position 218. The 7150 enzyme was found to undergo thermal inactivation at one-fourth the rate of the wild-type enzyme when incubated at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the mid-point in the thermally induced transition from the folded to unfolded state was found to be 2.4-3.9 degrees C higher for 7150 as determined by differential scanning calorimetry under a variety of conditions. The refined, 1.8-A crystal structures of the wild-type and 7150 subtilisin have been compared in detail, leading to the conclusion that slight improvements in hydrogen bond parameters in the vicinity of position 218 result in the enhanced thermal stability of 7150.",

        "abstract": "We previously suggested that proteins gain more stability from the burial and hydrogen bonding of polar groups than from the burial of nonpolar groups (Pace, C. N. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 310-313). To study this further, we prepared eight Thr-to-Val mutants of RNase Sa, four in which the Thr side chain is hydrogen-bonded and four in which it is not. We measured the stability of these mutants by analyzing their thermal denaturation curves. The four hydrogen-bonded Thr side chains contribute 1.3 +/- 0.9 kcal/mol to the stability; those that are not still contribute 0.4 +/- 0.9 kcal/mol to the stability. For 40 Thr-to-Val mutants of 11 proteins, the average decrease in stability is 1.0 +/- 1.0 kcal/mol when the Thr side chain is hydrogen-bonded and 0.0 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol when it is not. This is clear evidence that hydrogen bonds contribute favorably to protein stability. In addition, we prepared four Val-to-Thr mutants of RNase Sa, measured their stability, and determined their crystal structures. In all cases, the mutants are less stable than the wild-type protein, with the decreases in stability ranging from 0.5 to 4.4 kcal/mol. For 41 Val-to-Thr mutants of 11 proteins, the average decrease in stability is 1.8 +/- 1.3 kcal/mol and is unfavorable for 40 of 41 mutants. This shows that placing an [bond]OH group at a site designed for a [bond]CH3 group is very unfavorable. So, [bond]OH groups can contribute favorably to protein stability, even if they are not hydrogen-bonded, if the site was selected for an [bond]OH group, but they will make an unfavorable contribution to stability, even if they are hydrogen-bonded, when they are placed at a site selected for a [bond]CH3 group. The contribution that polar groups make to protein stability depends strongly on their environment.",

        "abstract": "This study reports the first quantitative estimate of the thermodynamic stability (Delta G degrees ) of a protein in low-temperature partly frozen aqueous solutions in the presence of the protective osmolytes trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), glycine betaine, and sarcosine. The method, based on guanidinium chloride denaturation of the azurin mutant C112S from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, distinguishes between the deleterious effects of subfreezing temperatures from those due specifically to the formation of a solid ice phase. The results point out that in the liquid state molar concentrations of these osmolytes stabilize significantly the native fold and that their effect is maintained on cooling to -15 degrees C. At this temperature, freezing of the solution in the absence of any additive causes a progressive destabilization of the protein, Delta G degrees decreasing up to 3-4 kcal/mol as the fraction of liquid water in equilibrium with ice ( V L) is reduced to less than 1%. The ability of the three osmolytes to prevent the decrease in protein stability at small V L varies significantly among them, ranging from the complete inertness of sarcosine to full protection by TMAO. The singular effectiveness of TMAO among the osmolytes tested until now is maintained high even at concentrations as low as 0.1 M when the additive stabilization of the protein in the liquid state is negligible. In all cases the reduction in Delta G degrees caused by the solidification of water correlates with the decrease in m-value entailing that protein-ice interactions generally conduct to partial unfolding of the native state. It is proposed that the remarkable effectiveness of TMAO to counter the ice perturbation is owed to binding of the osmolyte to ice, thereby inhibiting protein adsorption to the solid phase.",

        "abstract": "A series of Ala vs. Gly mutations at different helical and nonhelical positions of the chemotactic protein CheY, from E. coli, has been made. We have used this information to fit a general analytical equation that describes the free energy changes of an Ala to Gly mutation within +/- 0.45 kcal mol-1 with 95% confidence. The equation includes three terms: (1) the change in solvent-accessible hydrophobic surface area, corrected for the possible closure of the cavity left by deleting the C beta of the Ala; (2) the change in hydrophilic area of the nonintramolecularly hydrogen-bonded groups; and (3) the dihedral angles of the position being mutated. This last term extends the calculation to any conformation, not only alpha-helices. The general applicability of the equation for Ala vs. Gly mutations, when Ala or a small solvent-exposed polar residue is the wild-type residue, has been tested using data from other proteins: barnase, CI2 trypsin inhibitor, T4 lysozyme, and Staphylococcus nuclease. The predictive power of this simple approach offers the possibility of extending it to more complex mutations.",

In the molten globule state, most of the aromatic resonances deviate from their random coil values, indicating that aromatic side chains form some ordered structures in the molten globule state. When the urea concentration increases, the resonances are shifted, and the deviations from the random coil values are diminished. Because the chemical shifts of several random coil peptides are found to be independent of urea concentration, the urea-induced shifts of the resonances in the molten globule state reflect the unfolding transition of some ordered structures. The unfolding transitions measured by individual aromatic resonances do not coincide with each other. The unfolding transition curves obtained from some aromatic resonances are also different from those of the secondary structures measured by circular dichroism spectra. These results clearly show that the unfolding of the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin is not a cooperative two-state process.",

        "abstract": "To reveal the basis of the thermal stability of 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus, urea-induced unfolding of the enzyme and of its mesophilic counterpart from Escherichia coli has been studied. The urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of T. thermophilus and E. coli IPMDHs at 27 degreesC was monitored by measuring the changes in far-UV CD, intrinsic fluorescence, anilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) binding, and catalytic activity in the presence of nonionic detergent Tween 20. For both enzymes, the spectral methods revealed a biphasic unfolding transition. The first transition was protein concentration-independent, whereas the second was protein concentration-dependent for both enzymes. The observation suggested a three-state unfolding mechanism with a dimeric intermediate. However, the intermediates of the E. coli and the T. thermophilus IPMDHs seemed to be different from each other. The intermediate of the E. coli IPMDH lost its secondary and tertiary structure more than that of the thermophilic enzyme. E. coli IPMDH lost enzymatic activity through the transition from the native to the intermediate state, though the intermediate of the T. thermophilus enzyme was still active. The unfolding process of E. coli IPMDH can be explained by a sequential unfolding of individual folding domains, while there is only a small structural perturbation in the intermediate of T. thermophilus IPMDH. The higher thermal stability of T. thermophilus IPMDH can be attributed to the increase in the extent of interaction inside the first domain which unfolded prior to the unfolding of the whole molecular structure in E. coli IPMDH.",

The equilibrium transition curves of guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding in 13 and 26% (v/v) ethanol have shown that the unfolding significantly deviates from a two-state mechanism. The kinetics of denaturant-induced refolding and unfolding of hen egg-white lysozyme were investigated by stopped-flow CD at three ethanol concentrations: 0, 13, and 26% (v/v). Immediately after dilution of the denaturant, the refolding curves showed a biphasic time course in the far-UV region, with a burst phase with a significant secondary structure and a slower observable phase. However, when monitored by the near-UV CD, the burst phase was not observed and all refolding kinetics were monophasic. To clarify the effect of nonnative secondary structure induced by the addition of ethanol on the folding/unfolding kinetics, the kinetic m values were estimated from the chevron plots obtained for the three ethanol concentrations. The data indicated that the folding/unfolding kinetics of hen lysozyme in the presence of varying concentrations of ethanol under acidic condition is explained by a model with both on-pathway and off-pathway intermediates of protein folding.",

The modified protein has a structural stabilization energy of approximately 50% of that of native cytochrome c, whereas the secondary structure is not affected by the modification. In the modified protein the fraction of slow exchanging amides is smaller compared to that in the native protein, and the exchange rate constants are found to be 2-3 times larger for the slow (half-life of 5.5 h) and intermediate (half-life of 4.1 min) exchanging fraction of amides. The exchange rate of a fast exchanging fraction of amides (half-life smaller than 1 min), most likely surface exposed amides, is not influenced by tertiary destabilization of the protein. The results in aqueous solution agree well with data obtained by monitoring the amide-proton exchange using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance. In films, using attenuated total reflection infrared techniques, this difference in tertiary stability between modified and native cytochrome c could also be demonstrated.

The reduced protein was found to take, at low temperatures, a partially folded conformation that can be distinguished from both the native and denatured states. The folded protein was in a metastable state with delta GD value of 2.2-2.8 kcal/mol at 6 degrees C. The conformation was variable depending on temperature conditions; its stability was decreased at a lower temperature (1.0-1.2 kcal/mol at 0 degrees C). Subsequent reoxidation at 6 degrees C by oxidized glutathione led efficiently the reduced protein to the correctly renatured form having the iron-binding capacity, indicating that the partially folded state is the immediate precursor to subsequent oxidative refolding.",

This residue is central for the catalysis and stability of TbTIM. Cys14 was changed to the other 19 amino acids to determine the characteristics that the residue must have to yield catalytically competent stable enzymes. C14A, C14S, C14P, C14T, and C14V TbTIMs were essentially wild type in activity and stability. Mutants with Asn, Arg, and Gly had low activities and stabilities. The other mutants had less than 1% of the activity of TbTIM. One of the latter enzymes (C14F) was purified to homogeneity. Size exclusion chromatography and equilibrium sedimentation studies showed that C14F TbTIM is a monomer, with a k(cat) approximately 1000 times lower and a K(m) approximately 6 times higher than those of TbTIM. In C14F TbTIM, the ratio of the elimination (methylglyoxal and phosphate formation) to isomerization reactions was higher than in TbTIM. Its secondary structure was very similar to that of TbTIM; however, the quantum yield of its aromatic residues was lower. The analysis of the data with the 19 mutants showed that to yield enzymes similar to the wild type, the residue must have low polarity and a van der Waals volume between 65 and 110 A(3).

        "abstract": "The conformational stability of ribonuclease Sa (RNase Sa) has been measured at the per-residue level by NMR-monitored hydrogen exchange at pH* 5.5 and 30 degrees C. In these conditions, the exchange mechanism was found to be EXII. The conformational stability calculated from the slowest exchanging amide groups was found to be 8.8 kcal/mol, in close agreement with values determined by spectroscopic methods. RNase Sa is curiously rich in acidic residues (pI = 3.5) with most basic residues being concentrated in the active-site cleft. The effects of dissolved salts on the stability of RNase Sa was studied by thermal denaturation experiments in NaCl and GdmCl and by comparing hydrogen exchange rates in 0.25 M NaCl to water. The protein was found to be stabilized by salt, with the magnitude of the stabilization being influenced by the solvent exposure and local charge environment at individual amide groups. Amide hydrogen exchange was also measured in 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 M GdmCl to characterize the unfolding events that permit exchange. In contrast to other microbial ribonucleases studied to date, the most protected, globally exchanging amides in RNase Sa lie not chiefly in the central beta strands but in the 3/10 helix and an exterior beta strand. These structural elements are near the Cys7-Cys96 disulfide bond.",

        "abstract": "Barnase was mutated by inserting into its active site loop sequences found in the related enzyme ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1), according to either structural or sequential similarity alignments. The barnase/RNase T1 hybrid corresponding to the structural alignment of the two proteins, endo-[RNaseT1-(93-99)]102abarnase, contains RNase T1 residues at positions 93-99 inserted between residues at positions 102 and 103 of barnase. The other constructed mutant, endo-[RNaseT1-(95-98)]104abarnase, has RNase T1 residues at positions 95-98 inserted between residues at positions 104 and 105 in barnase, corresponding to published sequence alignments of the two proteins in this region. The mutants were characterized by absorbance, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy; the stability, folding and unfolding kinetics, and catalytic activity were measured and compared with the wild-type enzyme. Endo-[RNaseT1-(93-99)]102abarnase, the mutant protein corresponding to the structural alignment of barnase with ribonuclease T1, shows a slightly higher stability (approximately 5 kJ/mol) towards urea and heat denaturation than the mutant endo-[RNaseT1-(95-98)]104abarnase, designed according to a sequence alignment between the two enzymes. Both mutants have very low catalytic activity, although the effect of mutation is almost entirely limited to kcat in the case of the mutant corresponding to the structural alignment between barnase and ribonuclease T1, while both kcat and Km are affected in the mutant corresponding to the sequence alignment between the two enzymes. Thus, the superiority of structural over sequential alignments cannot be supported conclusively by direct experiment in the present case.",

        "abstract": "We measured whether solvent viscosity, and hence chain diffusion, plays a role in the rate-limiting step of the folding reactions of GCN4-p2', a simple alpha-helical coiled coil derived from the leucine zipper region of bZIP transcriptional activator GCN4. To deconvolute the dual effects of viscosogenic solvents on both viscosity, eta, and stability, earlier attempts assumed that the cosolvent and denaturant interact to the same degree in the transition state. Applying this analysis to GCN4-p2' yielded a nearly 1/eta dependence between folding rates and viscosity for both the dimeric and the cross-linked, monomeric versions of the coiled coil, but it revealed no such coherent relationship for cytochrome c. We also developed a method to determine the relative viscosity dependence of the dimeric and monomeric forms of the coiled coil independent of the assumption concerning the transition state's relative interaction with cosolvents and denaturants. Application of this method indicated that the effect of viscosity on both the folding and the unfolding rates was the same for the dimeric and monomeric versions, further supporting the view that the folding of the dimeric version is folding-limited rather than encounter-limited. The finding that GCN4-p2' folding appears to exhibit a 1/eta viscosity dependence implies that the rate-limiting step in folding is opposed predominantly by solvent-derived rather than internal frictional forces. These results are interpreted in relation to various models for protein folding.",

        "abstract": "Several models have been proposed to explain the high temperatures required to denature enzymes from thermophilic organisms; some involve greater maximum thermodynamic stability for the thermophile, and others do not. To test these models, we reversibly melted two analogous protein domains in a two-state manner. E2cd is the isolated catalytic domain of cellulase E2 from the thermophile Thermomonospora fusca. CenAP30 is the analogous domain of the cellulase CenA from the mesophile Cellulomonas fimi. When reversibly denatured in a common buffer, the thermophilic enzyme E2cd had a temperature of melting (Tm) of 72.2 degrees C, a van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (DeltaHVH) of 190 kcal/mol, and an entropy of unfolding (DeltaSu) of 0.55 kcal/(mol*K); the mesophilic enzyme CenAP30 had a Tm of 56.4 degrees C, a DeltaHVH of 107 kcal/mol, and a DeltaSu of 0. 32 kcal/(mol*K). The higher DeltaHVH and DeltaSu values for E2cd suggest that its free energy of unfolding (DeltaGu) has a steeper dependence on temperature at the Tm than CenAP30. This result supports models that predict a greater maximum thermodynamic stability for thermophilic enzymes than for their mesophilic counterparts. This was further explored by urea denaturation. Under reducing conditions at 30 degrees C, E2cd had a concentration of melting (Cm) of 5.2 M and a DeltaGu of 11.2 kcal/mol; CenAP30 had a Cm of 2.6 M and a DeltaGu of 4.3 kcal/mol. Under nonreducing conditions, the Cm and DeltaGu of CenAP30 were increased to 4.5 M and 10.8 kcal/mol at 30 degrees C; the Cm for E2cd was increased to at least 7.4 M at 32 degrees C. We were unable to determine a DeltaGu value for E2cd under nonreducing conditions due to problems with reversibility. These data suggest that E2cd attains its greater thermal stability (DeltaTm = 15.8 degrees C) through a greater thermodynamic stability (DeltaDeltaGu = 6.9 kcal/mol) compared to its mesophilic analogue CenAP30.",

        "abstract": "In this work we have investigated the contribution to protein stability of residues forming the boundaries of alpha-helices. At the N-terminus of helix 2 of human growth hormone there are two residues, Ser71 and Glu74, which form two reciprocal hydrogen bonds between the side chains and the backbone nitrogens of either residue (the N-capping box). In order to evaluate the stabilizing effect of each hydrogen bond, site-directed mutagenesis was employed. In addition, the effect of side-chain negative charge on helix stabilization, via charge dipole interaction, was assessed. Ultraviolet spectroscopy and near- and far-UV CD spectroscopy as well as guanidine hydrochloride protein denaturation were used as assays to monitor the conformational and free energy of stabilization changes induced by the point mutations. The results of these experiments can be summarized as follows: (a) receptor binding studies showed that the tertiary conformation of each mutant was similar to that of the native hormone, (b) far-UV CD spectroscopic analyses showed that the overall alpha-helical content was unchanged in the mutants, (c) UV absorption and CD spectroscopic analyses indicated small alterations in helical packing in those mutants in which the hydrogen bond between the side chain of Ser71 and backbone NH of Glu74 was disrupted, (d) the hydrogen bond involving the side chain of Ser71 contributes at least 1.0 kcal/mol to protein stabilization and has a 2-fold larger stabilizing effect than that of the hydrogen bond involving the Glu74 side chain, and (e) the putative charge-dipole interaction of Glu74 with the alpha-helix dipole does not contribute to the stabilization of the tertiary conformation of human growth hormone.",

        "abstract": "Crk-II is a signaling adaptor protein that is involved in many cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. It has a modular domain architecture consisting of an Src homology 2 domain (SH2) followed by two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. The structures and ligand-binding properties of the SH2 and the middle SH3 domains are well-characterized. Several studies suggest that the C-terminal SH3 domain plays an important regulatory role in the protein; however, no structural information is available on this domain, and relatively little is known about its binding partners. In the current work, we have solved the solution NMR structure of the C-terminal SH3 domain. The domain adopts the standard SH3 fold comprising a five-stranded beta barrel. In agreement with alignment and modeling studies, the structure indicates that the canonical-binding surface of the SH3 domain is unusually polar and suggests that this domain may not bind typical PXXP ligands or that it may bind them with reduced affinity. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies show that the domain folds in a reversible two-state manner and that the stability of the fold is similar to that observed for other SH3 domains. These studies offer some insight into the likely structural and thermodynamic consequences of point mutations in the cSH3 domain that are known to deregulate Crk-II function. Our results set the stage for a better understanding the role of the cSH3 domain in the context of the full-length protein.",

        "abstract": "The context-dependent nature in which mutations affect protein stability was investigated using the FK506-binding protein, FKBP12. Thirty-four mutations were made at sites throughout the protein, including residues located in the hydrophobic core, the beta-sheet, and the solvent-exposed face of the alpha-helix. Urea-induced denaturation experiments were used to measure the change in stability of the mutants relative to that of the wild type (Delta DeltaGU-F). The results clearly show that the extent of destabilization, or stabilization, is highly context-dependent. Correlations were sought in order to link Delta DeltaGU-F to various structural parameters. The strongest correlation found was between Delta DeltaGU-F and N, the number of methyl(ene) groups within a 6 A radius of the group(s) deleted. For mutations of buried hydrophobic residues, a correlation coefficient of 0.73 (n = 16,where n is the number of points) was obtained. This increased to 0.81 (n = 24) on inclusion of mutations of partially buried hydrophobic residues. These data could be superimposed on data obtained for other proteins for which similarly detailed studies have been performed. Thus, the contribution to stability from hydrophobic side chains, independent of the extent to which a side chain is buried, can be estimated quantitatively using N. This correlation appears to be a general feature of all globular proteins. The effect on stability of mutating polar and charged residues in the alpha-helix and beta-sheet was also found to be highly context-dependent. Previous experimental and statistical studies have shown that specific side chains can stabilize the N-caps of alpha-helices in proteins. Substitutions of Ile56 to Thr and Asp at the N-cap of the alpha-helix of FKBP12, however, were found to be highly destabilizing. Thus, the intrinsic propensities of an amino acid for a particular element of secondary structure can easily be outweighed by tertiary packing factors. This study highlights the importance of packing density in determining the contribution of a residue to protein stability. This is the most important factor that should be taken into consideration in protein design.",

        "abstract": "We have examined the chemical denaturations of the Klentaq and Klenow large-fragment domains of the Type 1 DNA polymerases from Thermus aquaticus (Klentaq) and Escherichia coli (Klenow) under identical solution conditions in order to directly compare the stabilization energetics of the two proteins. The high temperature stability of Taq DNA polymerase is common knowledge, and is the basis of its use in the polymerase chain reaction. This study, however, is aimed at understanding the thermodynamic basis for this high-temperature stability. Chemical denaturations with guanidine hydrochloride report a folding free energy (DeltaG) for Klentaq that is over 20 kcal/mol more favorable than that for Klenow under the conditions examined. This difference between the stabilization free energies of a homologous mesophilic-thermophilic protein pair is significantly larger than generally observed. This is due in part to the fact that the stabilization free energy for Klentaq polymerase, at 27.5 kcal/mol, is one of the largest ever determined for a monomeric protein. Large differences in the chemical midpoints of the unfolding (Cm) and the dependences of the unfolding free energy on denaturant concentration in the transition region (m-value) between the two proteins are also observed. Measurements of the sedimentation coefficients of the two proteins in the native and denatured states report that both proteins approximately double in hydrodynamic size upon denaturation, but that Klentaq expands somewhat more than Klenow.",

        "abstract": "Denaturation of defatted human albumin monomer, monitored by differential scanning calorimetry, is monophasic as reflected by the single, resulting endotherm. With low levels of various ligands, biphasic or monophasic unfolding processes are manifested as bimodal or unimodal thermograms, respectively. The greater the affinity of native protein for ligand, the greater is the tendency for biphasic denaturation. We propose that such a biphasic unfolding process arises from a substantial increase in stability (transition temperature) of remaining native protein during denaturation. This increase in stability derives from the free energy of ligand binding becoming more negative due to the release of high affinity ligand by unfolding protein. The tendency for biphasic denaturation is greatest at low (subsaturating) levels of ligand where greatest increases in stability occur. Biphasic unfolding arising from such ligand redistribution results from denaturation of different kinds of protein molecules, ligand-poor and ligand-rich species, and not from sequential unfolding of domains within the same molecule. Differentiating between these two mechanisms is necessary for the correct interpretation of biphasic denaturation data. Furthermore, biphasic unfolding due to ligand redistribution occurs independently of the means used to effect denaturation. The maximum increase in stability due to ligand binding relative to the stability of defatted albumin monomer alone occurs with the intermediate affinity ligand octanoate (22 degrees C) and not with the high affinity ligand hexadecanoate (15 degrees C). This indicates a much greater affinity of denatured albumin for hexadecanoate since increase in stability derives from the difference between free energy of ligand binding to folded and unfolded protein forms.",

The presence of two distinct heat absorption peaks allowed direct measurement of the enthalpy differences between the native, intermediate, and denatured states. Conditions of low pH and high NaCl concentration facilitated observation of the intermediate, or I-state. We propose to consider the nuclease protein as composed of two subdomains, divided along the active-site cleft. The structure of the I-state apparently consists mainly of the folded beta-barrel subdomain, as does that of a nuclease fragment protein [Shortle, D., & Abeygunawardana, C. (1993) Structure 1, 121-134]. The cooperativity of folding of the subdomains is maintained by electrostatic bonds across the active-site cleft. Removal of these bonds by the mutation D77A or E75V results in decooperation of the protein's structure and a three-state mechanism of denaturation at pH 7.0. The origins of differences in the enthalpy change of denaturation and in the m value of guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation with mutant nucleases are discussed in terms of this three-state mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The stability (reflected in denaturation temperature, Td) of defatted human albumin monomer, monitored by differential scanning calorimetry, decreases with increasing protein concentration. This is shown to be compatible with a simple model in which reversible polymerization of denatured monomer promotes unfolding. This model also predicts an increase in transition cooperativity with decreasing protein concentration whereas experimentally cooperativity decreases because the rate of thermally induced polymerization of unfolded monomer is slow relative to the scan rate of the calorimeter. The denaturation of undefatted human albumin monomer, subsaturated with high affinity endogenous long-chain fatty acid (LCFA), was previously observed by differential scanning calorimetry to be a biphasic process. Td for the first endotherm, associated with the denaturation of LCFA-poor species, decreases with increasing protein concentration similar to that for defatted monomer whereas Td for the second endotherm, associated with denaturation of LCFA-rich species, is independent of concentration. The magnitude of the concentration dependence of Td relates directly to the extent of polymerization of denatured monomer, which decreases with increasing level of bound ligand. The bimodal thermogram observed for undefatted monomer persists upon simultaneous extrapolation of Td values to low concentration and low scan rate thereby demonstrating that this biphasic denaturation arising from ligand redistribution during denaturation is a true thermodynamic phenomenon and not an artifact of specific experimental conditions or the method used to induce denaturation.",

The N-cap is found to stabilize the protein by up to approximately 2.5 kcal mol(-1).

        "abstract": "Asp residues are significantly under represented in beta-sheet regions of proteins, especially in the middle of beta-strands, as found by a number of studies using statistical, modeling, or experimental methods. To further understand the reasons for this under representation of Asp, we prepared and analyzed mutants of a beta-domain. Two Gln residues of the immunoglobulin light-chain variable domain (V(L)) of protein Len were replaced with Asp, and then the effects of these changes on protein stability and protein structure were studied. The replacement of Q38D, located at the end of a beta-strand, and that of Q89D, located in the middle of a beta-strand, reduced the stability of the parent immunoglobulin V(L) domain by 2.0 kcal/mol and 5.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Because the Q89D mutant of the wild-type V(L)-Len domain was too unstable to be expressed as a soluble protein, we prepared the Q89D mutant in a triple mutant background, V(L)-Len M4L/Y27dD/T94H, which was 4.2 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type V(L)-Len domain. The structures of mutants V(L)-Len Q38D and V(L)-Len Q89D/M4L/Y27dD/T94H were determined by X-ray diffraction at 1.6 A resolution. We found no major perturbances in the structures of these Q-->D mutant proteins relative to structures of the parent proteins. The observed stability changes have to be accounted for by cumulative effects of the following several factors: (1) by changes in main-chain dihedral angles and in side-chain rotomers, (2) by close contacts between some atoms, and, most significantly, (3) by the unfavorable electrostatic interactions between the Asp side chain and the carbonyls of the main chain. We show that the Asn side chain, which is of similar size but neutral, is less destabilizing. The detrimental effect of Asp within a beta-sheet of an immunoglobulin-type domain can have very serious consequences. A somatic mutation of a beta-strand residue to Asp could prevent the expression of the domain both in vitro and in vivo, or it could contribute to the pathogenic potential of the protein in vivo.",

The results show stabilization by sulfate via anion-specific binding in the concentration range 0-0.1 M and via the Hofmeister effect in the concentration range 0.1-1.0 M. The increase in T(m) caused by anion binding at 0.1 M sulfate is 20 degrees at pH 2 but only 1 degree at pH 9, where the net proton charge on the protein is near 0. The 10 degrees increase in T(m) between 0.1 and 1.0 M Na(2)SO(4), caused by the Hofmeister effect, is independent of pH. A striking property of the NaCl results is the absence of any significant stabilization by 0.1 M NaCl, which indicates that any Debye screening is small. pH-dependent stabilization is produced by 1 M NaCl: the increase in T(m) between 0 and 1.0 M is 14 degrees at pH 2 but only 1 degree at pH 9. The 14 degree increase at pH 2 may result from anion binding or from both binding and Debye screening. Taken together, the results for Na(2)SO(4) and NaCl show that native ribonuclease A is stabilized at low pH in the same manner as molten globule forms of cytochrome c and apomyoglobin, which are stabilized at low pH by low concentrations of sulfate but only by high concentrations of chloride.",

        "title": "Effects of point mutations in a hinge region on the stability, folding, and enzymatic activity of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase.", 
        "abstract": "The role of a hinge region in the folding, stability, and activity of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase was investigated with three site-directed mutants at valine-88, the central residue of the hinge. The three mutants, V88A and V88I and a valine-88 deletion, were created to perturb the packing of hydrophobic residues in the interior of a loose turn formed by residues 85-91. Deleting the valine-88 residue destabilized the protein by 2.93 +/- 0.6 kcal/mol as determined by equilibrium unfolding transitions in urea monitored by circular dichroism at 20 degrees C. Substitution of alanine for valine-88 stabilized the protein by -0.20 +/- 0.02 kcal/mol, and the isoleucine substitution was mildly destabilizing by 1.73 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol. Although there was no clear correlation between side-chain volume and stability, these results suggest that side-chain interactions in the interior of the turn influence the folding and stability of dihydrofolate reductase. The specific activity of the valine deletion mutant was approximately twice that of the wild-type protein while the specific activities of the V88A and V88I proteins were only slightly greater than the wild type. The full time courses of the reactions catalyzed by the mutants were almost identical with that for the wild type, indicating no major changes in the kinetic mechanism. Additionally, the rate constants associated with interconversion between various forms of the apoenzyme were identical for the mutant and wild-type enzymes. The rate constants for refolding transitions were examined by dilution of urea-inactivated protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Do the polarities of the N-terminus or the apolarity of the C-terminus of bovine RNase A influence the relative yields of its two 3D domain-swapped dimeric conformers, the N-dimer and C-dimer? We have addressed this question by substituting Ala-4 or Ala-5 with serine (A4S and A5S mutants) or Ser-123 with alanine (S123A mutant) through site-directed mutagenesis. Both the polarity of the N-terminus and the apolarity of the C-terminus of RNase A were, therefore, increased. CD spectra revealed no significant differences between the secondary structures of the mutants and native RNase A. According to thermal denaturation analyses, the A4S and A5S mutants are less stable, and the S123A mutant is more stable than wild type RNase A. By subjecting the mutants under mild or drastic denaturing conditions, side-by-side with native and recombinant RNase A, to a thermally induced oligomerization procedure, the following results were obtained. (i) The N-terminal mutants showed a higher propensity, with respect to the native protein, to form N-dimers under mild unfolding conditions. (ii) The C-terminal mutant showed a higher propensity to form the C-dimer under severely unfolding conditions. These results are discussed in light of the relative stabilities of the various RNase A species under different environmental conditions, and we conclude that the hydrophilic or hydrophobic character of the RNase N-terminus or C-terminus can be an important variable governing the oligomerization of RNase A and possibly other proteins through the 3D domain-swapping mechanism.",

        "title": "Stabilization of barstar by chemical modification of the buried cysteines.", 
        "abstract": "The internal packing of residues in the small monomeric protein barstar was severely perturbed by chemical modification of the two buried cysteine residues with the thiol reagent 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) after prior unfolding of the protein using guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). The modification produces mixed disulfides between 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and the two Cys residues. To understand the effects of the modification of the individual cysteine residues, Cys40 and Cys82, the modification was also carried out on the two single Cys --> Ala mutant forms of barstar, C40A and C82A, whose structures, activities, and stabilities were first shown to be similar to those of wt barstar. Equilibrium GdnHCl-induced denaturation studies on wt barstar show that the modification causes the midpoint of the denaturation curve to increase by 0.6 M and the stability to increase by 1.3 kcal mol-1. Both C40A and C82A also denature at higher concentrations of GdnHCl after modification. Modification of Cys40 has approximately the same stabilizing contribution as does modification of Cys82. The structures of the modified and unmodified proteins have been compared using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, UV difference absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is shown that the 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) groups introduced by reaction with DTNB are buried in hydrophobic environments in the modified C40A and C82A mutant proteins, as well as in modified wt barstar. The far-UV CD spectra of the modified and unmodified proteins are similar, but the mean residue ellipticity at 220 nm of wt barstar is reduced by 30% upon modification. Such a decrease is not seen for either C40A or C82A. The barnase-inhibiting activities of the three modified proteins are shown to be similar to those of the corresponding unmodified proteins. Thus, the severe perturbations of the internal packing, which result in a significant increase in stability, do not appear to affect the overall fold of barstar.",

        "abstract": "The refolding and unfolding kinetics of a soluble domain of apocytochrome b5 extending from residue 1 to 104 have been characterized using stopped flow and equilibrium-based fluorescence methods. The isolated apoprotein unfolds reversibly in the presence of GuHCl. From cooperative unfolding curves, the conformational stability (Delta G(uw)), in the absence of denaturant, is estimated to be 11.6 +/- 1.5 kJ mol-1 at 10 degrees C. The stability of apocytochrome b5 is lower than that of the corresponding form of the holoprotein (Delta G approximately 25 kJ mol-1) and exhibits a transition midpoint at 1.6 M GuHCl. Kinetic studies support the concept of a two-state model with both unfolding and refolding rates showing an exponential dependence on denaturant concentration with no evidence of the formation of transient intermediates in either limb of the chevron plot. Apocytochrome b5 is therefore an example of a protein in which both kinetics and equilibria associated with folding are described by a two-state model. The values of mku and mkf obtained from kinetic analysis are an indication of a transition state (mku/meq of 0.29) that resembles the native form by retaining similar solvent accessibility and many of the noncovalent interactions found in the apoprotein. The changes in heat capacity support a transition state that resembles the apoprotein with a value for Delta Cpf of -3.6 kJ mol-1 K-1 estimated for the refolding reaction. From these measurements, a model of refolding that involves the rapid nucleation of hydrophobic residues around Trp26 is suggested as a major event in the formation of the native apoprotein.",

        "title": "Structural characterization of an equilibrium unfolding intermediate in cytochrome c.", 
        "abstract": "Although the denaturant-induced unfolding transition of cytochrome c was initially thought to be a cooperative process, recent spectroscopic studies have shown deviations from two-state behavior consistent with accumulation of an equilibrium intermediate. However, little is known about the structural and thermodynamic properties of this state, and whether it is stabilized by the presence of non-native heme ligands. We monitored the reversible denaturant-induced unfolding equilibrium of oxidized horse cytochrome c using various spectroscopic probes, including fluorescence, near and far-UV CD, heme absorbance bands in the Soret, visible and near-IR regions of the spectrum, as well as 2D NMR. Global fitting techniques were used for a quantitative interpretation of the results in terms of a three-state model, which enabled us to determine the intrinsic spectroscopic properties of the intermediate. A well-populated intermediate was observed in equilibrium experiments at pH 5 using either guanidine-HCl or urea as a denaturant, both for wild-type cytochrome c as well as an H33N mutant chosen to prevent formation of non-native His-heme ligation. For a more detailed structural characterization of the intermediate, we used 2D 1H-15N correlation spectroscopy to follow the changes in peak intensity for individual backbone amide groups. The equilibrium state observed in our optical and NMR studies contains many native-like structural features, including a well-structured alpha-helical sub-domain, a short Trp59-heme distance and solvent-shielded heme environment, but lacks the native Met80 sulfur-iron linkage and shows major perturbations in side-chain packing and other tertiary interactions. These structural properties are reminiscent of the A-state of cytochrome c, a compact denatured form found under acidic high-salt conditions, as well as a kinetic intermediate populated at a late stage of folding. The denaturant-induced intermediate also resembles alkaline forms of cytochrome c with altered heme ligation, suggesting that disruption of the native methionine ligand favors accumulation of structurally analogous states both in the presence and absence of non-native ligands.",

        "abstract": "Sugars and polyols are used to stabilize proteins. The degree of stabilization conferred on a model protein by sucrose was calculated in terms of the free energy of folding. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) was denatured by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) in different sucrose concentrations. The linear extrapolation method [1,2] was used to calculate the free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant. Although sucrose increased the concentration of GuHCl required to unfold the protein, the free energy of folding in water was unchanged. In order to probe the nature of the stabilizing effect of sucrose, an FT-Raman spectroscopic study of denaturant-polyol systems was undertaken. Investigations of interactions between GuHCl, urea or formamide and polyhydric compounds, revealed no evidence for hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole associations. Polyhydric compounds caused minor changes in denaturant spectra although the converse was not observed. The structure of deuterated water changed on addition of denaturants. For non-ionic denaturants, addition of polyhydric solutes countered this change in water structure. Thus polyhydric compounds oppose the effect of denaturants on water structure. The observed increase in GuHCl concentration required to unfold PGK in the presence of sucrose may be attributed to this property of sucrose.",

Experimental results reveal that both chemical denaturation using guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and thermal unfolding of PsbQ proceed as a two-state reversible process. The denaturation free-energy changes (DeltaG(D)) at 20 degrees C extrapolated from GdnHCl (4.0 +/- 0.6 kcal mol(-1)) or thermal unfolding (4.4 +/- 0.8 kcal mol(-1)) are very close. Moreover, the far-UV CD spectra of the denatured PsbQ registered at 90 degrees C in the absence and presence of 6.0 M GdnHCl superimpose, leading us to conclude that both denatured states of PsbQ are structurally and energetically similar. The thermal unfolding of PsbQ has been also characterized by CD and DSC over a wide pH range. The stability of PsbQ is at its maximum at pH comprised between 5 and 8, being wider than the optimal pH for oxygen evolution in the lumen of thylakoid membranes. In addition, no significant structural changes were detected in PsbQ between 50 and 55 degrees C in the pH range of 3-8, suggesting that PsbQ behaves as a soluble and stable particle in the lumen when it detaches from PSII under physiological stress conditions such as high temperature (45-50 degrees C) or low pH (<5.0). Sedimentation experiments showed that, in solution at 20 degrees C, the PsbQ protein is a monomer with an elongated shape.",

        "abstract": "The thermal behavior of gamma II, gamma IIIA, gamma IIIB, and gamma IVA crystallin, from calorimetric and spectral studies, has been analyzed in terms of selective unfolding of domains, interdomain interactions, conformational stability, and the existence of intermediates in the order-disorder transition equilibrium. The major endothermic transition (Tm) observed calorimetrically for all four fractions occurs between 67 and 78 degrees C, with enthalpy change (delta H) from 80 to 150 kcal/mol, values that agree reasonably well with those from spectroscopic measurements. gamma II and gamma IIIB show a second thermal event at T less than Tm whereas gamma IIIA and gamma IVA showed no additional transition. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of gamma II at acidic pH, unlike gamma IVA, is biphasic as monitored by CD and fluorescence, indicating the existence of an intermediate. The absence of a cooperative transition in gamma IVA in acidic urea and the appearance of a single endotherm in differential scanning calorimetry at low pH have been attributed to a structured intermediate that melts at low temperature. The difference in the folding/unfolding of gamma II and gamma IVA has been explained by subtle differences in the packing arrangement of their two domains and interactions between them. Thermal aggregation of gamma-crystallins could be prevented either by preincubation with ionic detergents or at low pH or in the presence of chemical denaturant, indicating that the protein surface charge and solvent polarity influence their stability. An increase in the 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate-bound fluorescence during heat denaturation also suggests that the thermal aggregation is governed by hydrophobic interactions.",

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding and domain structure of myosin subfragment 1 (S1) from rabbit skeletal muscles and their changes induced by nucleotide binding were studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The binding of ADP to S1 practically does not influence the position of the thermal transition (maximum at 47.2 degrees C), while the binding of the non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP, adenosine 5'-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate (AdoPP[NH]P) to S1, or trapping of ADP in S1 by orthovanadate (Vi), shift the maximum of the heat adsorption curve for S1 up to 53.2 and 56.1 degrees C, respectively. Such an increase of S1 thermostability in the complexes S1-AdoPP[NH]P and S1-ADP-Vi is confirmed by results of turbidity and tryptophan fluorescence measurements. The total heat adsorption curves for S1 and its complexes with nucleotides were decomposed into elementary peaks corresponding to the melting of structural domains in the S1 molecule. Quantitative analysis of the data shows that the domain structure of S1 in the complexes S1-AdoPP[NH]P and S1-ADP-Vi is similar and differs radically from that of nucleotide-free S1 and S1 in the S1-ADP complex. These data are the first direct evidence that the S1 molecule can be in two main conformations which may correspond to different states during the ATP hydrolysis: one of them corresponds to nucleotide-free S1 and to the complex S1-ADP, and the other corresponds to the intermediate complexes S1-ATP and S1-ADP-Pi. Surprisingly it turned out that the domain structure of S1 with ADP trapped by p-phenylene-N, N'-dimaleimide (pPDM) thiol cross-linking almost does not differ from that of the nucleotide-free S1. This means that pPDM-cross-linked S1 in contrast to S1-AdoPP[NH]P and S1-ADP-Vi can not be considered a structural analogue of the intermediate complexes S1-ATP and S1-ADP-Pi.",

        "abstract": "Delta(5)-3-Ketosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas putida biotype B is one of the most proficient enzymes catalyzing an allylic isomerization reaction at rates comparable to the diffusion limit. The hydrogen-bond network (Asp99... Wat504...Tyr14...Tyr55...Tyr30) which links the two catalytic residues, Tyr14 and Asp99, to Tyr30, Tyr55, and a water molecule in the highly apolar active site has been characterized in an effort to identify its roles in function and stability. The DeltaG(U)(H2O) determined from equilibrium unfolding experiments reveals that the elimination of the hydroxyl group of Tyr14 or Tyr55 or the replacement of Asp99 with leucine results in a loss of conformational stability of 3.5-4.4 kcal/mol, suggesting that the hydrogen bonds of Tyr14, Tyr55, and Asp99 contribute significantly to stability. While decreasing the stability by about 6.5-7.9 kcal/mol, the Y55F/D99L or Y30F/D99L double mutation also reduced activity significantly, exhibiting a synergistic effect on k(cat) relative to the respective single mutations. These results indicate that the hydrogen-bond network is important for both stability and function. Additionally, they suggest that Tyr14 cannot function efficiently alone without additional support from the hydrogen bonds of Tyr55 and Asp99. The crystal structure of Y55F as determined at 1.9 A resolution shows that Tyr14 OH undergoes an alteration in orientation to form a new hydrogen bond with Tyr30. This observation supports the role of Tyr55 OH in positioning Tyr14 properly to optimize the hydrogen bond between Tyr14 and C3-O of the steroid substrate. No significant structural changes were observed in the crystal structures of Y30F and Y30F/Y55F, which allowed us to estimate approximately the interaction energies mediated by the hydrogen bonds Tyr30...Tyr55 and Tyr14...Tyr55. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hydrogen-bond network provides the structural support that is needed for the enzyme to maintain the active-site geometry optimized for both function and stability.",

        "abstract": "In an attempt to elucidate the determinants of redox potential and protein stability in cytochrome b5, three mutants at a highly conserved residue Val45, which is a member of heme hydrophobic pocket residues have been characterized. The V45Y mutant was designed to introduce a bulkier residue and a hydroxyl group to the heme pocket. The mutants V45H and V45E were constructed to test the effect of positive and negative charge on the stability and redox potential of proteins. The influence of these mutants on the protein stability towards thermal, urea, acid, ethanol and on the redox potential were studied. It is concluded that the decrease of hydrophobic free energy and the larger volume of the tyrosine make the phenylhydroxyl group of tyrosine still sitting inside the hydrophobic pocket, while the side chain of the mutant V45E and V45H shift away from the heme pocket. The redox potentials of mutants V45Y, V45H, V45E and wild-type of cytochrome b5 are -35 mV, 8 mV, -26 mV and -3 mV, respectively. The bigger change of the V45Y on redox potential is due to the close contact between the hydroxyl group and the heme, while the changes of the V45E and V45H result from the alteration of charge density and distribution around the heme. Different relative stability of these mutants towards heat have been observed with the order: WT > V45Y-V45H > V45E being both in the oxidized and reduced state. The relative stability induced by addition of urea decreases in the order: WT > V45Y > V45H > V45E. These results suggest that the difference in the hydrophobic free energy is a major factor contributing to the stability of the Val45 mutants. Also the loose of the helix III in the mutant V45E makes it more unstable. These results indicate that residue Val45 plays an important role in the stability and redox potential of the protein.",

        "abstract": "The intestinal fatty acid binding protein is one of a class of proteins that are primarily beta-sheet and contain a large interior cavity into which ligands bind. A highly conserved region of the protein exists between two adjacent antiparallel strands (denoted as D and E in the structure) that are not within hydrogen bonding distance. A series of single, double, and triple mutations have been constructed in the turn between these two strands. In the wild-type protein, this region has the sequence Leu 64/Gly 65/Val 66. Replacing Leu 64 with either Ala or Gly decreases the stability and the midpoint of the denaturation curve somewhat, whereas mutations at Gly 65 affect the stability slightly, but the protein folds at a rate similar to wild-type and binds oleate. Val 66 appears not to play an important role in maintaining stability. All double or triple mutations that include mutation of Leu 64 result in a large and almost identical loss of stability from the wild-type. As an example of the triple mutants, we investigated the properties of the Leu 64 Ser/Gly 65 Ala/Val 66 Asn mutant. As measured by the change in intrinsic fluorescence, this mutant (and similar triple mutants lacking leucine at position 64) folds much more rapidly than wild-type. The mutant, and others that lack Leu 64, have far-UV CD spectra similar to wild-type, but a different near-UV CD spectrum. The folded form of the protein binds oleate, although less tightly than wild-type. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies using electrospray mass spectrometry indicate many more rapidly exchangeable amide protons in the Leu 64 Ser/Gly 65 Ala/Val 66 Asn mutant. We propose that there is a loss of defined structure in the region of the protein near the turn defined by the D and E strands and that the interaction of Leu 64 with other hydrophobic residues located nearby may be responsible for (1) the slow step in the refolding process and (2) the final stabilization of the structure. We suggest the possibility that this region of the protein may be involved in both an early and late step in refolding.",

        "abstract": "To characterize the thermal stability of 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus, urea-induced unfolding of the enzyme and of its mesophilic counterpart from Escherichia coli was investigated at various temperatures. The unfolding curves were analyzed with a three-state model for E.coli IPMDH and with a two-state model for T.thermophilus IPMDH, to obtain the free energy change DeltaG degrees of each unfolding process. Other thermodynamic parameters, enthalpy change DeltaH, entropy change DeltaS and heat capacity change DeltaC(p), were derived from the temperature dependence of DeltaG degrees. The main feature of the thermophilic enzyme was its lower dependence of DeltaG degrees on temperature resulting from a low DeltaC(p). The thermophilic IPMDH had a significantly lower DeltaC(p), 1.73 kcal/mol.K, than that of E.coli IPMDH (20.7 kcal/mol.K). The low DeltaC(p) of T.thermophilus IPMDH could not be predicted from its change in solvent-accessible surface area DeltaASA. The results suggested that there is a large structural difference between the unfolded state of T.thermophilus and that of E.coli IPMDH. Another responsible factor for the higher thermal stability of T.thermophilus IPMDH was the increase in the most stable temperature T(s). The DeltaG degrees maximum of T.thermophilus IPMDH was much smaller than that of E.coli IPMDH. The present results clearly demonstrated that a higher melting temperature T(m) is not necessarily accompanied by a higher DeltaG degrees maximum.",

        "abstract": "Thermodynamics of thermal transitions of a calcium-binding lysozyme, canine milk lysozyme (CML), was studied using differential scanning calorimetry and compared with those for homologous proteins, human alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-hLA) and equine milk lysozyme (EML). The results showed that CML and EML exhibit two clear heat absorption peaks in the absence of calcium ions (apo-form), although the cooperative thermal transition of alpha-hLA is apparently absent in this form. The first peak represents the unfolding transition from the native to an unfolding intermediate state (N-I transition) and the second peak represents that from the intermediate to the thermally unfolded state (I-U transition). We interpret that the cooperative thermal transition, which is observed between the intermediate and the thermally unfolded states of CML and EML, comes from the native-like packing interaction in their intermediate states. Furthermore, to examine the role of the stabilization mechanism of CML intermediate, we constructed four variant CMLs (H21G, I56L, A93S and V109K), in which the residues of CML are substituted for those of EML, and also investigated their thermal stability. Especially the His21 and Val109 of CML play a role in stabilization of the intermediate state and their contributions to the unfolding free energy are estimated to be 2.0 and 1.8 kJ/mol, respectively. From the results of the mutational analysis, a few differences in the local helical interactions within the alpha-domain are found to be predominant in stabilizing the intermediate state.",

        "abstract": "Serum retinol binding protein (RBP) is a member of the lipocalin family, proteins with up-and-down beta-barrel folds, low levels of sequence identity, and diverse functions. Although tryptophan 24 of RBP is highly conserved among lipocalins, it does not play a direct role in activity. To determine if Trp24 and other conserved residues have roles in stability and/or folding, we investigated the effects of conservative substitutions for the four tryptophans and some adjacent residues on the structure, stability, and spectroscopic properties of apo-RBP. Crystal structures of recombinant human apo-RBP and of a mutant with substitutions for tryptophans 67 and 91 at 1.7 A and 2.0 A resolution, respectively, as well as stability measurements, indicate that these relatively exposed tryptophans have little influence on structure or stability. Although Trp105 is largely buried in the wall of the beta-barrel, it can be replaced with minor effects on stability to thermal and chemical unfolding. In contrast, substitutions of three different amino acids for Trp24 or replacement of Arg139, a conserved residue that interacts with Trp24, lead to similar large losses in stability and lower yields of native protein generated by in vitro folding. The results and the coordinated nature of natural substitutions at these sites support the idea that conserved residues in functionally divergent homologs have roles in stabilizing the native relative to misfolded structures. They also establish conditions for studies of the kinetics of folding and unfolding by identifying spectroscopic signals for monitoring the formation of different substructures.",

        "abstract": "Collagen-like peptides with potential for ion pair formation were studied to investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the triple-helix conformation. Three peptides--(POG)10, the EK-containing peptide (POG)4EKG(POG)5, and T3-487, a peptide with 18 residues of type III collagen and a C-terminal (GPO)4 tail--all form stable triple helices in aqueous solution, with melting temperatures of 58, 46, and 26 degrees C, respectively, at neutral pH. The thermal stabilities of these peptides correlate with their imino acid content, which is 66%, 60%, and 41%, respectively. Variation of pH over the range of 1-13 led to 8-9 degrees C changes in the Tm of the EK-containing peptide and peptide T3-487, with the greatest stability seen at pH values where both acidic and basic residues are ionized. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation shows these peptides are largely trimeric at low temperature, with no hexamers or larger aggregates, indicating that the pH-dependent stability arises from intramolecular interaction. Computer modeling indicates both intrachain ion pairs and interchain ion pairs can form and stabilize the triple helix. Studies of the pH dependence of the thermal stability of (POG)10 and the N-terminal acetylated form of T3-487 indicate that repulsion of the three charged N-terminal or C-terminal ends has a destabilizing effect. Taking into account these end effects, the energy contribution of two oppositely charged residues in a triple helix which are sterically capable of participating in ion pairs and backbone hydrogen bonding is 0.5-1 kcal/mol ion pair. It is possible that the stabilizing influence of ion pairs arises indirectly, through elimination of like charge repulsion, formation of ion pairs in the single chain form, or solvent effects.",

        "abstract": "The energy derived from optimized van der Waals interactions in closely packed, folded proteins has been proposed to be of similar energetic magnitude to hydrophobicity in stabilizing the native state. If packing is this energetically important, it should influence the evolution of protein core sequences. To test this hypothesis, the occurrence of various amino acid side chains in the major hydrophobic core of staphylococcal nuclease and 42 homologous proteins was determined. Most such positions in this protein family are usually isoleucine, leucine, or valine. Previously we have constructed and measured the stabilities of 12 single, 44 double, 64 triple, and 32 quadruple mutants, representing all possible permutations of these three side chains at two overlapping sets of four positions in the core of staphylococcal nuclease. The stabilities and interaction energies of those mutants with various combinations of the most common, or consensus, sequence were compared to the stabilities of all other mutants. Mutants which had the consensus side-chain combinations were not necessarily the most stable, but usually were found to have the best interaction energies. In other words, these proteins were far more stable than would be predicted from simply summing the observed energetic effects of the component single mutations, apparently reflecting particularly favorable packing interactions that are possible for the most common side chains. An additional 12 mutants which tested possible alternate explanations of the results were constructed. The stabilities and interaction energies of these mutants also support the conclusion that packing is a crucial determinant guiding the sequence evolution of protein cores.",

These Escherichia coli proteins are encoded on the same operon, with GroES positioned first. In this report, we have investigated the reversible folding of GroES. Using fluorescence anisotropy of dansyl-labeled GroES, intrinsic fluorescence, bis-ANS binding, sedimentation velocity, and limited proteolysis, we show that GroES unfolds in a single, two-state transition. Importantly, intrinsic fluorescence and sedimentation velocity analyses show that GroES is capable of refolding and reassembling from a urea denatured state. The refolded GroES is fully active as shown by its ability to assist GroEL in the refolding of rhodanese. These results indicate that chaperonins may not require other chaperonins for successful folding/assembly. We also show that GroES is capable of assisting in the refolding/reassembly of fully denatured GroEL. The reversible folding of GroES coupled with the ability of GroES to assist the refolding/reassembly of GroEL suggest that the groE operon may be organized in a manner that provides a structural role in GroES/GroEL assembly as well as a functional role.",

Thermal unfolding has been studied as a function of W0, the molar ratio of water to AOT, in the solution. Measuring the change in fluorescence intensity as a function of temperature, we observe a reversible transition for W0 in the range 5-12. Heating rate dependencies carried out on these transitions (0.6-3.0 degrees C/min) indicate that the transition temperature and the apparent van't Hoff enthalpy change depend on the scanning rate as well as on W0. The values of the transition temperature, T(m) and the enthalpy change, delta H degrees(un), extrapolated to an infinitely slow scanning rate, are analyzed considering the electrostatic interaction of the charged residues of the protein with the charges of the surfactant molecules forming reverse micelles, the variation of the size of the reverse micelles, and the relative rates of unfolding, refolding, and irreversible denaturation.",

        "abstract": "Human triosephosphate isomerase (hTIM) is a dimeric enzyme of identical subunits, adopting the alpha/beta-barrel fold. In a previous work, a monomeric mutant of hTIM was engineered in which Met14 and Arg98, two interface residues, were changed to glutamine. Analysis of equilibrium denaturation of this monomeric mutant, named M14Q/R98Q, revealed that its conformational stability, 2.5kcal/mol, is low as compared to the stability of dimeric hTIM (19.3 kcal/mol). The fact that this value is also lower than the conformational stabilities usually found for monomeric proteins suggests that the hTIM monomers are thermodynamically unstable. In the present work, we attempted to stabilize the M14Q/R98Q mutant by introducing stabilizing mutations in alpha-helices of the protein. Five mutations were proposed, designed to increase alpha-helix propensity by introducing alanines at solvent-exposed sites (Q179A, K193A), to introduce favorable interactions with helix dipoles (Q179D, S105D), or to reduce the conformational entropy of unfolding by introducing proline residues at the \"N-cap\" position of alpha-helices (A215P). Three replacements (Q179D, K193A, and A215P) were found to increase the stability of the native dimeric hTIM and the monomeric M14Q/R98Q. These results suggest that the monomeric hTIM mutant can be stabilized to a considerable extent by following well-established rules for protein stabilization. A comparison of the stabilizing effect performed by the mutations on the dimeric hTIM and the monomeric M14Q/R98Q allowed us to reinforce a model of equilibrium denaturation proposed for both proteins.",

From the results, a model is developed for thermal denaturation of beta-galactosidase which includes the reversible dissociation of ligands, reversible formation of an inactive tetramer, irreversible dissociation of the inactive tetramer to inactive monomers, and subsequent aggregation of inactive monomers to dimers and larger aggregates. Under some conditions, partial reversibility of the activity loss could be demonstrated, and several intermediates in the thermal denaturation process were trapped by quenching and observed by electrophoresis and molecular exclusion chromatography. The ligands Mg2+ and phenylethyl thio-beta-D-galactoside increase the stability of beta-galactosidase to heat denaturation by shifting the ligand binding equilibrium according to Le Chatelier's principle, thus decreasing the concentration of the ligand-free tetramer which can proceed to subsequent steps. Circular dichroism results indicated that beta-galactosidase is dominated by beta-sheet with lower amounts of alpha-helix. Large changes in secondary structure begin to occur only after activity has been lost. Single amino acid changes at the active site can have significant effects on thermal stability of beta-galactosidases. Some of the effects result from increased thermal stability of the ligand-free enzyme itself. Other effects result from changes in ligand binding, but the magnitude of the resulting changes in stability is not related to the strength of ligand binding in a simple fashion.",

We have determined the energetics of placing Ile or Asn residues at four buried positions in a two-stranded coiled coil. As expected, Ile is favored over Asn at these buried positions, but not as much as predicted by considering only the hydrophobic effect. It appears that interstrand hydrogen bonds form between the side-chains of the buried Asn residues and these contribute to the conformational stability of the coiled-coil peptides. However, these contributions are highly dependent on the locations of the Asn pairs.

        "abstract": "The irreversible thermal unfolding of the class A beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus has been investigated at pH 7.0, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and inactivation kinetic techniques. DSC transitions showed a single peak with a denaturation enthalpy of 646 kJ.mol-1 and were moderately scan rate dependent, suggesting that the process was partially kinetically controlled. The inactivation kinetics at constant temperature showed that the irreversible denaturation of the enzyme occurs as the sum of two exponential terms whose amplitudes are strongly temperature dependent within the transition range so that, at the lowest temperatures within this interval, irreversible inactivation would proceed mainly through the slow phase. The fraction of irreversibly denatured enzyme (D) as a function of temperature for a given scanning rate was calculated by numerical integration of the kinetic equation with temperature, using previously determined kinetic parameters. This D form was the most populated of the unfolded states only at temperatures well above the maximum in the calorimetric transition. Combination of the results of kinetic and DSC experiments has allowed us to separate the contribution of the final D state to the excess enthalpy change from the contribution arising from the reversibly denatured forms of the enzyme (I(i), i = 1,..., n), with the resulting conclusion that the scan rate dependence of the calorimetric traces was the result of two different dynamic effects, viz., the irreversible step and a slow relaxation process during formation of the reversibly denatured intermediate states. Finally, the problems of using results obtained at a single scan rate to validate the two-state kinetic model are commented on.",

The conformational stability of apoflavodoxin from Anaboena PCC 7119 has been studied by calorimetry and urea denaturation as a function of pH and ionic strength. At pH > 12, the protein is unfolded. Between pH 11 and pH 6, the apoprotein is folded properly as judged from near-ultraviolet (UV) circular dichroism (CD) and high-field 1H NMR spectra. In this pH interval, apoflavodoxin is a monomer and its unfolding by urea or temperature follows a simple two-state mechanism. The specific heat capacity of unfolding for this native conformation is unusually low. Near its isoelectric point (3.9), the protein is highly insoluble. At lower pH values (pH 3.5-2.0), apoflavodoxin adopts a conformation with the properties of a molten globule. Although apoflavodoxin at pH 2 unfolds cooperatively with urea in a reversible fashion and the fluorescence and far-UV CD unfolding curves coincide, the transition midpoint depends on the concentration of protein, ruling out a simple two-state process at acidic pH. Apoflavodoxin constitutes a promising system for the analysis of the stability and folding of alpha/beta proteins and for the study of the interaction between apoflavoproteins and their corresponding redox cofactors.",

        "abstract": "To clarify the role of amino acid residues at turns in the conformational stability and folding of a globular protein, six mutant human lysozymes deleted or substituted at turn structures were investigated by calorimetry, GuHCl denaturation experiments, and X-ray crystal analysis. The thermodynamic properties of the mutant and wild-type human lysozymes were compared and discussed on the basis of their three-dimensional structures. For the deletion mutants, Delta47-48 and Delta101, the deleted residues are in turns on the surface and are absent in human alpha-lactalbumin, which is homologous to human lysozyme in amino acid sequence and tertiary structure. The stability of both mutants would be expected to increase due to a decrease in conformational entropy in the denatured state; however, both proteins were destabilized. The destabilizations were mainly caused by the disappearance of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Each part deleted was recovered by the turn region like the alpha-lactalbumin structure, but there were differences in the main-chain conformation of the turn between each deletion mutant and alpha-lactalbumin even if the loop length was the same. For the point mutants, R50G, Q58G, H78G, and G37Q, the main-chain conformations of these substitution residues located in turns adopt a left-handed helical region in the wild-type structure. It is thought that the left-handed non-Gly residue has unfavorable conformational energy compared to the left-handed Gly residue. Q58G was stabilized, but the others had little effect on the stability. The structural analysis revealed that the turns could rearrange the main-chain conformation to accommodate the left-handed non-Gly residues. The present results indicate that turn structures are able to change their main-chain conformations, depending upon the side-chain features of amino acid residues on the turns. Furthermore, stopped-flow GuHCl denaturation experiments on the six mutants were performed. The effects of mutations on unfolding-refolding kinetics were significantly different among the mutant proteins. The deletion/substitutions in turns located in the alpha-domain of human lysozyme affected the refolding rate, indicating the contribution of turn structures to the folding of a globular protein.",

        "abstract": "In order to quantitate the contributions of the polar, uncharged amino acids to the stability of the native state of staphylococcal nuclease, each of the 13 alanines, 9 glycines, 9 threonines, 6 prolines, 6 glutamines, 6 asparagines, and 3 serines was substituted, either with both alanine and glycine or with 1 of these 2 amino acids plus valine. For each mutant, the stability to reversible denaturation (delta GH2O) was quantitated by determining the Kapp for this reaction as a function of guanidine hydrochloride concentration. In addition, the parameter mGuHCl (= d(delta G)/d[GuHCl]) was calculated from the data. To identify the local structural features responsible for the relatively large and variable changes in delta GH2O and mGuHCl observed for the same type of substitution at different locations in nuclease, statistical correlations were sought between delta GH2O, mGuHCl, and a number of descriptors of the local structure. As with substitutions of the large hydrophobic amino acids [Shortle, D., Stites, W. E., & Meeker, A. K. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8033-8041], mutation of polar, uncharged residues to Gly leads to a change in stability that, on average, correlates well with the degree to which the wild-type residue is buried. This correlation is especially significant for threonine, an amino acid with both polar and hydrophobic character, but is not demonstrated for the more typically hydrophobic residue alanine. As reported in the previous study of alanine/glycine substitutions of hydrophobic residues, a significant correlation between changes in stability and changes in the value of mGuHCl is again observed, strengthening the conclusion that the putative structural changes in the denatured state which lead to increases or decreases in mGuHCl are responsible for a significant fraction of the stability loss for an average mutant. The existence of this correlation is consistent with the denatured state of wild-type staphylococcal nuclease having evolved to a relatively high free energy via optimization of a balance between a maximal exposure of hydrophobic surface and a minimal gain in chain entropy. On average, mutations are less stable in proportion to the extent of which they perturb this balance. A new and puzzling correlation is reported between the extent of buriedness of a residue in the wild-type native state versus the difference in mGuHCl between the Ala mutation and the Gly mutation at that position.",

        "abstract": "The structural stability of a peroxidase, a dimeric protein from palm tree Chamaerops excelsa leaves (CEP), has been characterized by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism and steady-state tryptophan fluorescence at pH 3. The thermally induced denaturation of CEP at this pH value is irreversible and strongly dependent upon the scan rate, suggesting that this process is under kinetic control. Moreover, thermally induced transitions at this pH value are dependent on the protein concentration, leading to the conclusion that in solution CEP behaves as dimer, which undergoes thermal denaturation coupled with dissociation. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of CEP denaturation at pH 3 was accomplished on the basis of the simple kinetic scheme N-->kD, where k is a first-order kinetic constant that changes with temperature, as given by the Arrhenius equation; N is the native state, and D is the denatured state, and thermodynamic information was obtained by extrapolation of the kinetic transition parameters to an infinite heating rate.",

        "abstract": "A series of individual alanine mutations has been constructed in the helical region 115 to 123 in phage T4 lysozyme in order to evaluate the contribution to protein stability of the different side-chains within this region. Pairwise alanine mutations and a combination mutant with seven alanine substitutions were constructed to evaluate the additive effects upon structure and stability. Only three residues within this region (Ser117, Leu118 and Leu121) have a substantial influence upon stability (change in free energy of unfolding greater than 1.0 kcal/mol). Replacement of Ser117 with alanine results in an increase in protein stability of 1.27 kcal/mol, apparently due to the release of strain present in the wild-type protein. Replacement of the buried residues Leu118 and Leu121 is destabilizing. Substitution of the remaining six residues with alanine has relatively little effect on stability. This is consistent with prior studies showing that only 20 to 30% of the residues in amphipathic helices in T4 lysozyme are critical for stability. For some of the pairwise alanine mutants the effects on stability are additive. For most of these mutants, however, there is a slight (approximately 0.15 to 0.25 kcal/mol) non-additivity such that the double mutant is more stable than the sum of the constituent single mutants. This effect is consistently observed for residues with positions i, i +4; i.e. adjacent, but in consecutive turns of the helix, suggesting a weak but significant interaction between these amino acid residues. A more pronounced non-additivity (approximately 0.5 kcal/mol) is seen in the seven-alanine combination mutant. This non-additivity is due to a modest \"collapse\" or \"repacking\" that occurs for the combination mutants (especially the multiple alanine mutant) but is not possible for the single replacements. The truncation of some side-chains permits an increase in solvent accessibility of main-chain amide and carbonyl groups. This effect is most pronounced for the seven-alanine combination mutant, where two solvent molecules, not present in wild-type, hydrogen bond to main-chain carbonyl groups in the middle region of the helix. It has been suggested that the binding of such water molecules might represent the first step in solvent-mediated unfolding of an alpha-helix. The appearance of ordered solvent, however, appears to have very little effect on stability (approximately less than 0.2 kcal/mol).",

        "title": "Human RAD52 protein has extreme thermal stability.", 
        "abstract": "The human RAD52 protein plays an important role in the earliest stages of chromosomal double-strand break repair via the homologous recombination pathway. Individual subunits of RAD52 associate into seven-membered rings. These rings can form higher order complexes. RAD52 binds to DNA breaks, and recent studies suggest that the higher order self-association of the rings promotes DNA end joining. Monomers of the RAD52(1--192) deletion mutant also associate into ring structures but do not form higher order complexes. The thermal stability of wild-type and mutant RAD52 was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Three thermal transitions (labeled A, B, and C) were observed with melting temperatures of 38.8, 73.1, and 115.2 degrees C. The RAD52(1--192) mutant had only two thermal transitions at 47.6 and 100.9 degrees C (labeled B and C). Transitions were labeled such that transition C corresponds to complete unfolding of the protein. The effect of temperature and protein concentration on RAD52 self-association was analyzed by dynamic light scattering. From these data a four-state hypothetical model was developed to explain the thermal denaturation profile of wild-type RAD52. The three thermal transitions in this model were assigned as follows. Transition A was attributed to the disruption of higher order assemblies of RAD52 rings, transition B to the disruption of rings to individual subunits, and transition C to complete unfolding. The ring-shaped quaternary structure of RAD52 and the formation of higher ordered complexes of rings appear to contribute to the extreme stability of RAD52. Higher ordered complexes of rings are stable at physiological temperatures in vitro.",

        "abstract": "The stability of bovine lactoperoxidase to denaturation by guanidinium-HCl, urea, or high temperature was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and tryptophan fluorescence. The calorimetric scans were observed to be dependent on the heating scan rate, indicating that lactoperoxidase stability at temperatures near Tm is controlled by kinetics. The values for the thermal transition, Tm, at slow heating scan rate were 66.8, 61.1, and 47.2 degrees C in the presence of 0.5, 1, and 2 M guanidinium-HCl, respectively. The extrapolated value for Tm in the absence of guanidinium-HCl is 73.7 degrees C, compared with 70.2 degrees C obtained by experiment; a lower experimental value without a denaturant is consistent with distortion of the thermal profile due to aggregation or other irreversible phenomenon. Values for the heat capacity, Cp, at Tm and Ea for the thermal transition decrease under conditions where Tm is lowered. At a given concentration, urea is less effective than guanidinium-HCl in reducing Tm, but urea reduces Cp relatively more. Both fluorescence and DSC indicate that thermally denatured protein is not random coil. A change in fluorescence around 35 degrees C, which was previously reported for EPR and CD measurements (Boscolo et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1774 (2007) 1164-1172), is not seen by calorimetry, suggesting that a local and not a global change in protein conformation produces this fluorescence change.",

The guanidine-HCl induced unfolding and thermal unfolding of these proteins were studied to characterize the effect of incorporation of these tryptophan analogues on the thermodynamic stability of the proteins. The three proteins have tryptophan residues at positions 140 (in wild type) and 66 (in the Delta 137-149 fragment of V66W) and at both positions (in V66W). The unfolding data show that 5-hydroxytryptophan does not perturb the stability of wild-type nuclease, but it destabilizes the fragment and causes the V66W mutant to unfold in a more cooperative manner. 7-Azatryptophan is found to destabilize all three proteins. 4-Fluorotryptophan is slightly stabilizing of the three proteins, but the other two fluorotryptophans do not alter the stability of the proteins.",

        "abstract": "The reduction in apparent operator binding affinity found for dimeric lac repressor proteins produced by disruption of the C-terminal coiled-coil interaction has been proposed to derive from thermodynamic linkage between dimer-monomer and protein-DNA equilibria [Brenowitz et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1281]. To explore this linkage, we have employed two dimeric proteins, a deletion mutant (-11 aa) missing 11 amino acids at the C-terminus that has diminished apparent operator binding affinity [Chen & Matthews (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13843] and a mutant (R3) that binds to operator with wild-type affinity in which the C-terminal leucine heptad repeats of lac repressor were replaced by the GCN4 dimerization sequence [Alberti et al. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 3227; Chen et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. (in press)]. To avoid the complexities of working at the low concentrations of protein required by the high affinity between the monomer subunits, urea denaturation studies were undertaken to determine the free energy change(s) for dissociation and/or unfolding. Under denaturing conditions, dimer dissociation and monomer unfolding were found to be concerted processes, and the free energy change for the overall process of dimer to unfolded monomer was derived from these experiments for the two dimeric proteins. A monomeric mutant (Y282D) of the lactose repressor was examined to determine the free energy change of protomer unfolding. From the combination of these data, the Kd for -11 aa dimer dissociation was determined to be 7.7 x 10(-8) M, and the corresponding value for R3 protein was 3.2 x 10(-11) M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The effects of hydrophobic core mutations on the stability and structure of the four-helix calcium-binding protein, calbindin D9k, have been investigated. Eleven mutations involving eight residues distributed within the hydrophobic core of calbindin D9k were examined. Stabilities were measured by denaturant and thermal induced unfolding monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The mutations were found to exert large effects on the stability with midpoints in the urea induced unfolding varying from 1.8 M for Leu23 --> Gly up to 6.6 M for Val70 --> Leu and free energies of unfolding in the absence of denaturant ranging from 6.6 to 27.4 kJ/mol for the Phe66 --> Ala mutant and the wild-type, respectively. A significant correlation was found between the difference in free energy of unfolding (Delta Delta GNU) and the change in the surface area of the side chain caused by the mutation, in agreement with other studies. Notably, both increases and decreases in side-chain surface area caused quantitatively equivalent effects on the stability. In other words, a correlation between the absolute value of the change in the surface of the side chain and Delta DeltaGNU was observed with a value of approximately 0.14 kJ M-1 A-2. The generality of this observation is discussed. Significant effects on the cooperativity of the unfolding reaction were also observed. However, a correlation between the cooperativity and Delta Delta GNU, which has been reported in other systems as an indication of effects of mutations on the unfolded state, was not observed for calbindin D9k. Despite the large effects on Delta Delta GNU and cooperativity, the structures of the mutants in the native form remained intact as indicated by circular dichroism, NMR, and fluorescence measurements. The structural response to calcium-binding was also conserved. The following paper in this issue [Kragelund, B. B., et al.

        "abstract": "The \"right-sided\" and \"left-sided\" substrate binding modes at the lower saccharide binding subsites (D-F sites) of chicken lysozyme were investigated by utilizing mutant lysozymes secreted from yeast. We constructed the following mutant lysozymes; \"left-sided\" substitution of Asn46 to Asp, deletion of Thr47, and insertion of Gly between Thr47 and Asp48 and \"right-sided\" substitution of Asn37 to Gly. Analyses of their activities and substrate binding abilities showed that Asn46 and Thr47 are involved in the initial enzyme-substrate complex and Asn37 is involved in the transition state. These results support an earlier proposal that interactions between substrate and residues at the left side of lysozyme stabilize a catalytically inactive enzyme-substrate complex, while interactions between substrate and residues at the right side stabilize the catalytically active complex [Pincus, M. R., & Scheraga, H. A. (1979) Macromolecules 12, 633-644]. These results are also consistent with the proposed kinetic mechanism for lysozyme reaction that the rearrangement of an initial enzyme-substrate complex (beta-complex) to another complex (gamma-complex) is required for catalytic hydrolysis [Banerjee S.

        "abstract": "We describe the de novo design and biophysical characterization of a model coiled-coil protein in which we have systematically substituted 20 different amino acid residues in the central \"d\" position. The model protein consists of two identical 38 residue polypeptide chains covalently linked at their N termini via a disulfide bridge. The hydrophobic core contained Val and Ile residues at positions \"a\" and Leu residues at positions \"d\". This core allowed for the formation of both two-stranded and three-stranded coiled-coils in benign buffer, depending on the substitution at position \"d\". The structure of each analog was analyzed by CD spectroscopy and their relative stability determined by chemical denaturation using GdnHCI (all analogs denatured from the two-stranded state). The oligomeric state(s) was determined by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium analysis in benign medium. Our results showed a thermodynamic stability order (in order of decreasing stability) of: Leu, Met, Ile, Tyr, Phe, Val, Gln, Ala, Trp, Asn, His, Thr, Lys, Ser, Asp, Glu, Arg, Orn, and Gly. The Pro analog prevented coiled-coil formation. The overall stability range was 7.4 kcal/mol from the lowest to the highest analog, indicating the importance of the hydrophobic core and the dramatic effect a single substitution in the core can have upon the stability of the protein fold. In general, the side-chain contribution to the level of stability correlated with side-chain hydrophobicity. Molecular modelling studies, however, showed that packing effects could explain deviations from a direct correlation. In regards to oligomerization state, eight analogs demonstrated the ability to populate exclusively one oligomerization state in benign buffer (0.1 M KCl, 0.05 M K(2)PO(4)(pH 7)). Ile and Val (the beta-branched residues) induced the three-stranded oligomerization state, whereas Tyr, Lys, Arg, Orn, Glu and Asp induced the two-stranded state. Asn, Gln, Ser, Ala, Gly, Phe, Leu, Met and Trp analogs were indiscriminate and populated two-stranded and three-stranded states. Comparison of these results with similar substitutions in position \"a\" highlights the positional effects of individual residues in defining the stability and numbers of polypeptide chains occurring in a coiled-coil structure. Overall, these results in conjunction with other work now generate a relative thermodynamic stability scale for 19 naturally occurring amino acid residues in either an \"a\" or \"d\" position of a two-stranded coiled-coil. Thus, these results will aid in the de novo design of new coiled-coil structures, a better understanding of their structure/function relationships and the design of algorithms to predict the presence of coiled-coils within native protein sequences.",

The consequences of the deletion of fifteen and three C-terminal amino acids on the conformational state and on the guanidine hydrochloride-induced and thermal unfolding of PGK were investigated by using near- and far-UV CD, tryptophan fluorescence, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid binding, accessibility to chemical modification, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results of these studies indicate that the conformations of both domains and of the interdomain region were altered by these deletions. In the absence of the 15-amino acid C-terminal peptide [delta(401-415)], the N-terminal domain exhibits several characteristics of a molten globule state, whereas the C-terminal domain retains native-like, although distinctly different, tertiary structure. Deletion of three C-terminal amino acids [delta(413-415)] also globally affects PGK conformation, although to a much lesser extent. Both C-terminal deletions resulted in a significant decrease in protein stability, as demonstrated by their increased susceptibility to guanidine-induced and thermal denaturation. These results suggest that the formation of a native tertiary fold of PGK requires the presence of a complete polypeptide chain.",

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies show that hemopexin is largely stabilized by heme, which binds exclusively to domain I. The melting temperature (Tm) of heme-hemopexin is 66.4 +/- 0.7 degrees C as compared with 53.9 +/- 0.3 degrees C for apohemopexin, and this Tm increase is accompanied by a 100 kcal increase in molar enthalpy. Heme stabilizes hemopexin by stabilizing domain I. This is demonstrated by the 26 degrees C increase in Tm from 51.9 +/- 0.3 to 77.6 +/- 0.6 degrees C and the over 3-fold increase in molar enthalpy when domain I associates with heme. A moderate change in domain I secondary structure is indicated by an increase in negative molar ellipticity at 206 nm. However, there is no net effect on the secondary structure of holo-hemopexin caused by heme binding as indicated by both far-UV circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectra. The characteristic positive ellipticity of hemopexin at 233 nm, ascribed to tryptophan residues in domain II, is dramatically increased, suggesting a change in teritary structure for domain II of hemopexin. DSC and CD results show that isolated domain I and domain II interact both in the presence and absence of heme. Moreover, domain II destabilizes heme-domain I, which may be an important factor in facilitating heme release to the hemopexin receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The recombinant expression of immunoglobulin domains, Fabs and scFvs in particular, in Escherichia coli can vary significantly from antibody to antibody. We hypothesized that poor Fab expression is often linked to poor intrinsic stability. To investigate this further, we applied a novel approach for stabilizing a poorly expressing anti-tetanus toxoid human Fab with a predisposition for being misfolded and non-functional. Forty-five residues within the Fab were chosen for saturation mutagenesis based on residue frequency analysis and positional entropy calculations. Using automated screening, we determined the approximate midpoint temperature of thermal denaturation (TM) for over 4000 library members with a maximum theoretical diversity of 855 unique mutations. This dataset led to the identification of 11 residue positions, primarily in the Fv region, which when mutated enhanced Fab stability. By combining these mutations, the TM of the Fab was increased to 92 degrees C. Increases in Fab stability correlated with higher expressed Fab yields and higher levels of properly folded and functional protein. The mutations were selected based on their ability to increase the apparent stability of the Fab and therefore the exact mechanism behind the enhanced expression in E.coli remains undefined. The wild-type and two optimized Fabs were converted to an IgG1 format and expressed in mammalian cells. The optimized IgG1 molecules demonstrated identical gains in thermostability compared to the Fabs; however, the expression levels were unaffected suggesting that the eukaryotic secretion system is capable of correcting potential folding issues prevalent in E.coli.

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of ribonuclease A has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry in the presence of 4-chlorobutan-1-ol. The thermal transitions were observed to be reversible at pH 5.5 in the presence of low concentration (up to 50 mM) of the alcohol, irreversible in the intermediate (50 mM < c < mM) and again reversible in the presence of 250 mM and higher concentrations of 4-chlorobutan-1-ol. In the presence of 50 mM 4-chlorobutan-1-ol, ribonuclease A is present in two conformational states unfolding at different temperatures. The reversible thermal transitions have been fitted to a two-state native-to-denatured mechanism. Irreversible thermal transitions have been analyzed according to two-state irreversible native-to-denatured kinetic model. Using the irreversible model, rate constant as a function of temperature and energy of activation of the irreversible process have been calculated. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic results corroborate the DSC observations and indicate a protein conformation with poorly defined tertiary structure and high content of secondary structure in the presence of 50 mM 4-chlorobutan-1-ol at a temperature corresponding to the second transition. Similar results have been observed at pH 3.9.",

        "abstract": "The conformational and thermal stability of full-length hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus (strain X31) has been investigated using a combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), analytical ultracentrifugation, fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy as a function of pH. HA sediments as a rosette comprised of 5-6 trimers (31-35 S) over the pH range of 7.4-5.4. The DSC profile of HA in the native state at pH 7.4 is characterized by a single cooperative endotherm with a transition temperature (Tm) of 66 degrees C and unfolding enthalpy (DeltaH(cal)) of 800 kcal x (mol of trimer)(-1). Upon acidification to pH 5.4, there is a significant decrease in the transition temperature (from 66 to 45 degrees C), unfolding enthalpy [from 800 to 260 kcal x (mol of trimer)(-1)], and DeltaH(cal)/DeltaH(vH) ratio (from 3.0 to approximately 1.3). Whereas the far- and near-UV ellipticities are maintained over this pH range, there is an acid-induced increase in surface hydrophobicity and decrease in intrinsic tryptophanyl fluorescence. The major contribution to the DSC endotherm arises from unfolding HA1 domains. The relationship between acid-induced changes in thermal stability and the fusion activity of HA has been examined by evaluating the kinetics and extent of fusion of influenza virus with erythrocytes over the temperature and pH range of the DSC measurements. Surprisingly, X31 influenza virus retains its fusion activity at acidic pH and temperatures significantly below the unfolding transition of HA. This finding is consistent with the notion that the fusion activity of influenza virus may involve structural changes of only a small fraction of HA molecules.",

The two cation binding loci are identified as nucleotide sites N and E, respectively. Mg2+ at the N-site controls the stability and structure of the alphabeta-tubulin dimer. Mg2+ dissociation is followed by the slow release of bound nucleotide and functional inactivation. Mg2+ bound to the N-site significantly increases the thermal stability of the GDP-tubulin dimer (by 10 degrees C and approximately 50 kcal mol-1 of experimental enthalpy change). However, the thermal stability of Mg2+-liganded GDP- and GTP-tubulin is the same. Mg2+ binding to the N-site is linked to the alphabeta-dimer formation. The binding of Mg2+ to the alpha-subunit communicates a marked enhancement of fluorescence to a colchicine analogue bound to the beta-subunit. Colchicine, in turn, thermally stabilizes Mg2+-depleted tubulin. The tubulin properties described would be simply explained if the N-site and the colchicine site are at the alpha-beta dimerization interface. It follows that the E-site would be at the beta-end of the tubulin dimer, consistent with the known functional role of the E nucleotide gamma-phosphate and coordinated cation controlling microtubule stability.",

The positively charged residue at position 13 and the negatively charged residue at position 90 are close together in those cytochromes c for which three-dimensional structures are available. We have replaced the amino acids at these two positions by cysteine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-cytochrome c; in an earlier study, Cys102 was replaced by threonine without negatively influencing the physical or enzymic properties of the protein. The mutated proteins [R13C, C102T]cytochrome c (iso-1-cytochrome c containing Arg13-->Cys and Cys102-->Thr mutations), [D90C, C102T]cytochrome c (iso-1-cytochrome c containing Asp90-->Cys and Cys102-->Thr mutations) and [R13C, D90C, C102T]cytochrome c (iso-1-cytochrome c containing Arg13-->Cys, Asp90-->Cys, and Cys102-->Thr mutations) are functional in vivo. Free sulfhydryl titration shows that the doubly mutated forms each contain one sulfhydryl group while the triple mutant contains two sulfhydryl groups. The stability of mutant [R13C, C102T]cytochrome c resembles that of [C102T] cytochrome c, whereas the stability of [D90C, C102T]cytochrome c resembles the stability of [R13C, D90C, C102T]cytochrome c. The activity of cytochrome-c oxidase using cytochrome c was monitored polarographically. Compared to the wild-type or [C102T]cytochrome c, which shows two kinetic phases with cytochrome-c oxidase, [D90C, C102T]cytochrome c has much the same profile; [R13C, C102T]cytochrome c and [R13C, D90C, C102T]cytochrome c exhibit one kinetic phase with decreased activity. Electron-transfer activity of the mutant cytochromes c is inhibited by Hg2+. The inhibition is highest for the triple mutant, less for [R13C, C102T]cytochrome c, even less for [D90C, C102T]cytochrome c and insignificant for the wild type. It would appear as though the stability of the triple mutant follows the changes that result from the Asp90-->Cys mutation while the activity changes follow those of the Arg13-->Cys mutation.",

        "abstract": "It is now recognized that unfolded states of globular proteins are not random coils but instead can contain significant amounts of residual structure. Here, we combine amide H/D exchange studies and thermodynamic measurements to probe pH dependent structure in the unfolded state of the small, mixed alpha-beta protein CTL9. The m value measured by urea denaturation is strongly dependent upon pD, increasing by 40% from pD 7.5 to 4.85. Likewise, the change in heat capacity upon unfolding, deltaCp(o), increases significantly from pD 7.5 to 5.5. These studies argue that the unfolded state contains interactions, presumably hydrophobic in nature, that lead to a more compact state at high pH. The expansion at lower pH correlates with the estimated unfolded state pKa values of the three histidines in CTL9 with additional contributions from acid side chains at the lower pH. Amide H/D exchange studies were conducted at pD 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. At pD 5.0, the exchange rates could be measured for 44 residues, 29 of which exchanged by global unfolding. No evidence was found for any super protected sites, that is, sites that exchange at rates slower than those expected for global exchange. The estimated precision for the experiments limits detection to residues that are protected 2.3-fold above the intrinsic exchange rate. Thirty-seven residues could be followed at pD 6 and 27 residues at pD 7. Again no evidence for a significant super protected structure was observed. The properties of CTL9(11) are compared to other structured denatured states.",

U.S.A. 87, 573-577] that beta-lactamase, cytochrome c, and apomyoglobin are maximally unfolded at pH 2 under conditions of low ionic strength, but a further decrease in pH, by increasing the concentration of HCl, refolds the proteins to the A state with properties similar to those of a molten globule state. To understand the mechanism of acid-induced refolding of protein structure, we studied the effects of various strong acids and their neutral salts on the acid-unfolded states of ferricytochrome c and apomyoglobin. The conformational transition of cytochrome c was monitored at 20 degrees C by using changes in the far-UV CD and in the Soret absorption at 394 nm, and that of apomyoglobin was monitored by changes in the far-UV CD. Various strong acids (i.e., sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, trichloroacetic acid, and trifluoroacetic acid) refolded the acid-unfolded cytochrome c and apomyoglobin to the A states as was the case with HCl. For both proteins neutral salts of these acids caused similar conformational transitions, confirming that the anions are responsible for bringing about the transition. The order of effectiveness of anions was shown to be ferricyanide greater than ferrocyanide greater than sulfate greater than thiocyanate greater than perchlorate greater than iodide greater than nitrate greater than trifluoroacetate greater than bromide greater than chloride.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "To elucidate how enzymes adapt to extreme environmental conditions, a comparative study with a thermostable alpha-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis (BLA) and its mesophilic homologue from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BAA) was performed. We measured conformational stability, catalytic activity, and conformational fluctuations on the picosecond time scale for both enzymes as a function of temperature. The objective of this study is to analyze how these properties are related to each other. BLA shows its maximal catalytic activity at about 90-95 degrees C and a strongly reduced activity (only 20% of the maximum) at room temperature. Although B. licheniformis itself is a mesophilic organism, BLA shows an activity profile typical for a thermophilic enzyme. In contrast to this, BAA exhibits its maximal activity at about 80 degrees C but with a level of about 60% activity at room temperature. In both cases the unfolding temperatures T(m) are only 6 degrees C (BAA, T(m) = 86 degrees C) and 10 degrees C (BLA, T(m) = 103 degrees C), respectively, higher than the temperatures for maximal activity. In contrast to many previous studies on other thermophilic-mesophilic pairs, in this study a higher structural flexibility of the thermostable BLA was measured as compared to the mesophilic BAA. The findings of this study neither indicate a proportionality between the observed dynamics and the catalytic activity nor support the idea of more \"rigid\" thermostable proteins, as often proposed in the concept of \"corresponding states\".",

If X retains native-like buried hydrophobic interaction, DeltaC(p)(X) must be less than DeltaC(p)(D), the constant-pressure heat capacity change associated with the transition, N<-->D, where the state D is not only more unfolded than X but it also has its all groups exposed to water. One problem is that for most proteins D is observed only in the presence of chemical denaturants such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and urea. Another problem is that DSC cannot yield authentic DeltaC(p)(D), for its measurement invokes the existence of putative specific binding sites for the chemical denaturants on N and D. We have developed a non-calorimetric method for the measurements of DeltaC(p)(D), which uses thermodynamic data obtained from the isothermal GdmCl (or urea)-induced denaturation and heat-induced denaturation in the presence of the chemical denaturant concentration at which significant concentrations of both N and D exist. We show that for each of the proteins (ribonuclease-A, lysozyme, alpha-lactalbumin and chymotrypsinogen) DeltaC(p)(D) is significantly higher than DeltaC(p)(X). DeltaC(p)(D) of the protein is also compared with that estimated using the known heat capacities of amino acid residues and their fractional area exposed on denaturation.",

The stability of the HPV-16 E2 DNA-binding domain is concentration-dependent, and the unfolding reaction is well described as a two-state transition from folded dimer to unfolded monomer. The conformational stability of the protein, delta GH2O, was found to be 9.8 kcal/mol at pH 5.6, with the corresponding equilibrium unfolding/dissociation constant, Ku, being 6.5 x 10(-8) M. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments give a Kd of 3.0 x 10(-8) M, showing an excellent agreement between the two different techniques. Denaturation by temperature followed by the change in ellipticity also shows a concomitant disappearance of secondary and tertiary structures. The Ku changes dramatically at physiologically relevant pH's: with a change in pH from 6.1 to 7.0, it goes from 5.5 x 10(-8) M to 4.4 x 10(10) M. Our results suggest that, at the very low concentration of protein where DNA binding is normally measured (e.g., 10(-11) M), the protein is predominantly monomeric and unfolded.

        "abstract": "To investigate the structural and thermodynamic basis of the binding of solvent at internal sites within proteins a number of mutations were constructed in T4 lysozyme. Some of these were designed to introduce new solvent-binding sites. Others were intended to displace solvent from preexisting sites. In one case Val-149 was replaced with alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, isoleucine, and glycine. Crystallographic analysis shows that, with the exception of isoleucine, each of these substitutions results in the binding of solvent at a polar site that is sterically blocked in the wild-type enzyme. Mutations designed to perturb or displace a solvent molecule present in the native enzyme included the replacement of Thr-152 with alanine, serine, cysteine, valine, and isoleucine. Although the solvent molecule was moved in some cases by up to 1.7 A, in no case was it completely removed from the folded protein. The results suggest that hydrogen bonds from the protein to bound solvent are energy neutral. The binding of solvent to internal sites within proteins also appears to be energy neutral except insofar as the bound solvent may prevent a loss of energy due to potential hydrogen bonding groups that would otherwise be unsatisfied. The introduction of a solvent-binding site appears to require not only a cavity to accommodate the water molecule but also the presence of polar groups to help satisfy its hydrogen-bonding potential. It may be easier to design a site to accommodate two or more water molecules rather than one as the solvent molecules can then hydrogen-bond to each other. For similar reasons it is often difficult to design a point mutation that will displace a single solvent molecule from the core of a protein.",

        "abstract": "Proline isomerization, an intrinsically slow process, kinetically traps intermediates in slow protein folding reactions. Thus, enzymes that catalyze proline isomerization (prolyl isomerases) often catalyze protein folding. We have investigated the folding kinetics of FKBP, a prolyl isomerase. The main conclusion is that FKBP catalyzes its own folding. Altogether, the FKBP refolding kinetics are resolved into three exponential phases: a fast phase, tau 3; an intermediate phase, tau 2; and a slow phase, tau 1. Unfolding occurs in a single phase, the unfolding branch of phase tau 2. In the presence of native FKBP, both the intermediate (tau 2) and slow (tau 1) phases are faster, suggesting that folding phases tau 1 and tau 2 involve proline cis-trans isomerization. In the absence of added native FKBP, autocatalytic folding of FKBP is detected. For refolding starting with all the FKBP unfolded initially, the slowest folding phase (tau 1) is almost 2-fold faster at a final concentration of 14 microM FKBP than at 2 microM FKBP, suggesting that catalytically active FKBP formed in the fast (tau 3) or intermediate (tau 2) folding phases catalyzes the slow folding phase (tau 1). Moreover, autocatalysis of folding is inhibited by FK506, an inhibitor of the FKBP prolyl isomerase activity. The results show that the slow phase in FKBP folding is an autocatalyzed formation of native FKBP from kinetically trapped species with non-native proline isomers. While the magnitude of the catalytic effects reported here are modest, FKBP folding may provide a prototype for autocatalysis of kinetically trapped macromolecular conformational changes in other systems.",

The sites of temperature-sensitive substitutions are found in both the beta-sheets and the turns of the protein, and some sites are exposed to the solvent while others are not. Thirteen of the variant proteins were purified and characterized to evaluate their free energy changes upon unfolding and their affinities for single-stranded DNA, and eight were tested for their tendencies to aggregate at 42 degrees C. Each of the three temperature-sensitive mutants at buried sites and six of ten at surface sites had free energy changes of unfolding substantially lower (less stabilizing) than the wild-type at 25 degrees C. A seventh mutant at a surface site had a substantially altered unfolding transition and its free energy of unfolding was not estimated. The affinities of the mutant proteins for single-stranded DNA varied considerably, but two mutants at a surface site, Lys69, had much weaker binding to single-stranded DNA than any of the other mutants, while two mutants at another surface site, Glu30, had the highest DNA-binding affinities. The wild-type gene V protein is stable at 42 degrees C, but six of the eight mutants tested aggregated within a few minutes and the remaining two aggregated within 30 minutes at this temperature. Overall, each of the temperature-sensitive proteins tested had a tendency to aggregate at 42 degrees C, and most also had either a low free energy of unfolding (at 25 degrees C), or weak DNA binding. We suggest that any of these properties can lead to a temperature-sensitive gene V phenotype.",

The first intermediate is formed by the interaction of SDS with native cytochrome c, and this intermediate retains the majority of the secondary structure while the tertiary structure of the protein is lost. The unfolding of this intermediate with urea leads to the formation of a second intermediate, which is also formed on refolding of the unfolded protein (unfolded by urea) by SDS. The second intermediate retains about 50% of the native secondary structure with no tertiary structure of the protein. The second intermediate was found to be absent at low pH. While induction of helical structure of a protein by SDS in the native condition has been reported earlier, this is possibly the first report of the refolding of a protein in a strongly denaturing condition (in the presence of 10 M urea). The relative contributions of the hydrophobic and the electrostatic interactions of the surfactants with cytochrome c have been determined from the formation of the molten globule species from the acid-induced unfolded protein in the presence of SDS or lauryl maltoside.",

The liver-specific MAT isoform, MAT III, is a homodimer of a 43.7-kDa subunit that organizes in three nonsequential alpha-beta domains. Although MAT III structure has been recently resolved, little is known about its folding mechanism. Equilibrium unfolding and refolding of MAT III, and the monomeric mutant R265H, have been monitored using different physical parameters. Tryptophanyl fluorescence showed a three-state folding mechanism. The first unfolding step was a folding/association process as indicated by its dependence on protein concentration. The monomeric folding intermediate produced was the predominant species between 1.5 and 3 m urea. It had a relatively compact conformation with tryptophan residues and hydrophobic surfaces occluded from the solvent, although its N-terminal region may be very unstructured. The second unfolding step monitored the denaturation of the intermediate. Refolding of the intermediate showed first order kinetics, indicating the presence of a kinetic intermediate within the folding/association transition. Its presence was confirmed by measuring the 1,8-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonic acid binding in the presence of tripolyphosphate. We propose that the folding rate-limiting step is the formation of an intermediate, probably a structured monomer with exposed hydrophobic surfaces, that rapidly associates to form dimeric MAT III.",

        "abstract": "The factor for inversion stimulation (FIS) is a homodimeric DNA-binding protein found in enteric bacteria. FIS consists of 98 residues and self-assembles into an entwined dimer containing a flexible and mostly disordered N-terminus followed by four alpha-helices. Proline 61, which is 100% conserved in FIS homologues, is located at the center of helix B, and its substitution for alanine (P61A) was previously shown to result in nonuniform stabilization of the protein, leading to the appearance of a marginally populated dimeric intermediate in urea denaturation equilibrium studies. Here we show that, in contrast to WT FIS, the thermal denaturation of P61A FIS was incomplete and yielded a transition curve that was independent of FIS concentration, suggesting the presence of a dimeric intermediate at 90 degrees C. In the presence of urea, the thermal denaturation of P61A FIS became concentration dependent, consistent with the denaturation of the dimeric intermediate. The existence of a thermostable dimeric intermediate of P61A FIS was further confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments at 95 degrees C. Urea denaturation experiments at 90 degrees C revealed a cooperative transition, indicating that the dimeric intermediate of P61A FIS has a solvent-protected hydrophobic core. P61A FIS, unlike the WT protein, was found to be resistant to denaturation by low pH, but its thermal denaturation at pH 3.5 revealed a biphasic transition, providing clues about the structure of the dimeric intermediate. From a functional perspective, it is plausible that the full conservation of proline 61 in FIS may serve to limit the stability and proteolytic resistance of this highly regulated transcription factor.",

        "abstract": "Membrane fusion between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the target cell plasma membrane is correlated with conformational changes in the HIV gp41 glycoprotein, which include an early exposed conformation (prehairpin) and a late low energy six helix bundle (SHB) conformation also termed hairpin. Peptides resembling regions from the exposed prehairpin have been previously studied for their interaction with membranes. Here we report on the expression, purification, SHB stability, and membrane interaction of the full-length ectodomain of the HIV gp41 and its two deletion mutants, all in their SHB-folded state. The interaction of the proteins with zwitterionic and negatively charged membranes was examined by using various biophysical methods including circular dichroism spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, lipid mixing of large unilamellar vesicles, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). All experiments were done in an acidic environment in which the protein remains in its soluble trimeric state. The data reveal that all three proteins fold into a stable coiled-coil core in aqueous solution and retain a stable helical fold with reduced coiled-coil characteristics in a zwitterionic and negatively charged membrane mimetic environment. Furthermore, in contrast with the extended exposed N-terminal domain, the folded gp41 ectodomain does not induce lipid mixing of zwitterionic membranes. However, it disrupts and induces lipid mixing of negatively charged phospholipid membranes (approximately 100-fold more effective than fusion peptide alone), which are known to be expressed more in HIV-1-infected T cells or macrophages. The results support the emerging model in which one of the roles of gp41 folding into the SHB conformation is to slow down membrane disruption effects induced by early exposed gp41. However, it can further affect membrane morphology once exposed to negatively charged membranes during late stages.",

        "abstract": "The folding of maltose-binding protein, a periplasmic protein in Escherichia coli, was shown to proceed through the same rate-limiting step whether folding occurred in the cell under physiological conditions or in vitro in the absence of other proteins. Four species of maltose-binding protein containing aminoacyl substitutions identified as decreasing the rate of folding of the protein in vivo were purified, and their denaturant-induced folding transitions were analyzed by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan. In all four cases the rate of folding in vitro was slower than that of the wild-type maltose-binding protein; thus the same step determines the rate of folding in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, examination of the three-dimensional structure of maltose-binding protein as determined by x-ray crystallography (F. Quiocho, personal communication; Spurlino, J. C., Lu, G.-Y., and Quiocho, F. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5202-5219) indicates that all 4 of the residues identified as crucial to folding lie in one structural element of the native protein.

        "abstract": "Chaperonin 10 (cpn10) is a well-conserved subgroup of the molecular chaperone family. GroES, the cpn10 from Escherichia coli, is composed of seven 10kDa subunits, which form a dome-like oligomeric ring structure. From our previous studies, it was found that GroES unfolded completely through a three-state unfolding mechanism involving a partly folded monomer and that this reaction was reversible. In order to study whether these unfolding-refolding characteristics were conserved in other cpn10 proteins, we have examined the structural stabilities of cpn10s from rat mitochondria (RatES) and from hyperthermophilic eubacteria Thermotoga maritima (TmaES), and compared the values to those of GroES. From size-exclusion chromatography experiments in the presence of various concentrations of Gdn-HCl at 25 degrees C, both cpn10s showed unfolding-refolding characteristics similar to those of GroES, i.e. two-stage unfolding reactions that include formation of a partially folded monomer. Although the partially folded monomer of TmaES was considerably more stable compared to GroES and RatES, it was found that the overall stabilities of all three cpn10s were achieved significantly by inter-subunit interactions. We studied this contribution of inter-subunit interactions to overall stability in the GroES heptamer by introducing a mutation that perturbed subunit association, specifically the interaction between the two anti-parallel beta-strands at the N and C termini of this protein. From analyses of the mutants' stabilities, it was revealed that the anti-parallel beta-strands at the subunit interface are crucial for subunit association and stabilization of the heptameric GroES protein.",

        "abstract": "alpha-Lactalbumin is a small, globular protein that is stabilized by four disulfide bonds and contains two structural domains. One of these domains is rich in alpha-helix (the alpha-domain) and has Cys 6-Cys 120 and Cys 28-Cys 111 disulfide bonds. The other domain is rich in beta-sheet (the beta-domain), has Cys 61-Cys 77 and Cys 73-Cys 91 disulfide bonds, and includes one calcium binding site. To investigate the interaction between domains, we studied derivatives of bovine alpha-lactalbumin differing in the number of disulfide bonds, using calorimetry and CD at different temperatures and solvent conditions. The three-disulfide form, having a reduced Cys 6-Cys 120 disulfide bond with carboxymethylated cysteines, is similar to intact alpha-lactalbumin in secondary and tertiary structure as judged by its ellipticity in the near and far UV. the two-disulfide form of alpha-lactalbumin, having reduced Cys 6-Cys 120 and Cys 28-Cys 111 disulfide bonds with carboxymethylated cysteines, retains about half the secondary and tertiary structure of the intact alpha-lactalbumin. The remaining structure is able to bind calcium and unfolds cooperatively upon heating, although at lower temperature and with significantly lower enthalpy and entropy. We conclude that, in the two disulfide form, alpha-lactalbumin retains its calcium-binding beta-domain, whereas the alpha-domain is unfolded. It appears that the beta-domain does not require alpha-domain to fold, but its structure is stabilized significantly by the presence of the adjacent folded alpha-domain.",

        "abstract": "Extensive measurements and analysis of thermodynamic stability and kinetics of urea-induced unfolding and folding of hisactophilin are reported for 5-50 degrees C, at pH 6.7. Under these conditions hisactophilin has moderate thermodynamic stability, and equilibrium and kinetic data are well fit by a two-state transition between the native and the denatured states. Equilibrium and kinetic m values decrease with increasing temperature, and decrease with increasing denaturant concentration. The betaF values at different temperatures and urea concentrations are quite constant, however, at about 0.7. This suggests that the transition state for hisactophilin unfolding is native-like and changes little with changing solution conditions, consistent with a narrow free energy profile for the transition state. The activation enthalpy and entropy of unfolding are unusually low for hisactophilin, as is also the case for the corresponding equilibrium parameters. Conventional Arrhenius and Eyring plots for both folding and unfolding are markedly non-linear, but these plots become linear for constant DeltaG/T contours. The Gibbs free energy changes for structural changes in hisactophilin have a non-linear denaturant dependence that is comparable to non-linearities observed for many other proteins. These non-linearities can be fit for many proteins using a variation of the Tanford model, incorporating empirical quadratic denaturant dependencies for Gibbs free energies of transfer of amino acid constituents from water to urea, and changes in fractional solvent accessible surface area of protein constituents based on the known protein structures. Noteworthy exceptions that are not well fit include amyloidogenic proteins and large proteins, which may form intermediates. The model is easily implemented and should be widely applicable to analysis of urea-induced structural transitions in proteins.",

        "abstract": "Mutational analysis was performed to probe the development of hydrophobic clusters during the early events in the folding of dihydrofolate reductase. Replacements were made in several hydrophobic subdomains to examine the roles of hydrophobicity and stereochemistry in the formation of kinetic intermediates. Amide protons in two of these clusters, including residues I91, I94, and I155, have been shown to be protected against solvent exchange within 13 ms of folding. Additional hydrophobic clusters were probed by substitutions at residues I2, I61, and L112; these residues are not protected from exchange until later in the folding reaction. Valine and leucine replacements at positions I91, I94, and I155 significantly diminish the formation of the burst phase kinetic intermediate, relative to the wild-type protein. In contrast, I2 and I61 are insensitive to these substitutions in the first 5 ms of the folding reaction, as is the replacement of L112 with either isoleucine or valine. These results demonstrate that the tightly packed core of dihydrofolate reductase is acquired in a non-uniform fashion, beginning in the submillisecond time frame. The progressive development of specific side-chain packing in localized hydrophobic clusters may be a common theme for complex protein folding reactions.",

Here the disulfide exchange equilibrium constant, Kred, between the protein C32S,C35S-L78C thioredoxin and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide is studied as a function of urea concentration. Since the disulfide exchange reaction and the stability of the proteins are thermodynamically linked, independent knowledge of the stabilities of the modified and unmodified proteins along with measurements of Kred allows us to assign Kred values for the folded and urea-unfolded forms of the protein. We find that the disulfide exchange reaction is more favorable for the folded protein, in agreement with the increased stability of the modified protein, and that the Kred values for both states are independent of the urea concentration. Finally, Kred values for the unfolded protein are the same, within experimental error, as that for N-acetylcysteine methylamide, an analog of cysteine in a peptide chain without the possibility of intramolecular interactions. Thus, we conclude that modification of position 78 of thioredoxin does not affect the unfolded state. The relevance of these results toward protein stability studies is discussed.",

To further examine the role of left-handed residues in the conformational stability of a protein, we constructed ten Gly to Ala mutant human lysozymes. Most Gly residues in human lysozyme are located in the left-handed helix region. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation and crystal structures were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray analysis, respectively. The difference in denaturation Gibbs energy (DeltaDeltaG) for the ten Gly to Ala mutants ranged from + 1.9 to -7.5 kJ/mol, indicating that the effect of the mutation depends on the environment of the residue. We confirm that Gly in a left-handed region is more favorable at rigid sites than non-Gly, but there is little difference in energetic cost between Gly and non-Gly at flexible sites. The present results indicate that dihedral angles in the backbone conformation and also the flexibility at the position should be considered for analyses of protein stability, and protein structural determination, prediction, and design.",

        "abstract": "To further examine the structural and thermodynamic basis of hydrophobic stabilization in proteins, all of the bulky non-polar residues that are buried or largely buried within the core of T4 lysozyme were substituted with alanine. In 25 cases, including eight reported previously, it was possible to determine the crystal structures of the variants. The structures of four variants with double substitutions were also determined. In the majority of cases the \"large-to-small\" substitutions lead to internal cavities. In other cases declivities or channels open to the surface were formed. In some cases the structural changes were minimal (mainchain shifts < or = 0.3 A); in other cases mainchain atoms moved up to 2 A. In the case of Ile 29 --> Ala the structure collapsed to such a degree that the volume of the putative cavity was zero. Crystallographic analysis suggests that the occupancy of the engineered cavities by solvent is usually low. The mutants Val 149 --> Ala (V149A) and Met 6 --> Ala (M6A), however, are exceptions and have, respectively, one and two well-ordered water molecules within the cavity. The Val 149 --> Ala substitution allows the solvent molecule to hydrogen bond to polar atoms that are occluded in the wild-type molecule. Similarly, the replacement of Met 6 with alanine allows the two solvent molecules to hydrogen bond to each other and to polar atoms on the protein. Except for Val 149 --> Ala the loss of stability of all the cavity mutants can be rationalized as a combination of two terms. The first is a constant for a given class of substitution (e.g., -2.1 kcal/mol for all Leu --> Ala substitutions) and can be considered as the difference between the free energy of transfer of leucine and alanine from solvent to the core of the protein. The second term can be considered as the energy cost of forming the cavity and is consistent with a numerical value of 22 cal mol(-1) A(-3). Physically, this term is due to the loss of van der Waal's interactions between the bulky sidechain that is removed and the atoms that form the wall of the cavity. The overall results are consistent with the prior rationalization of Leu --> Ala mutants in T4 lysozyme by Eriksson et al. (Eriksson et al., 1992, Science 255:178-183).",

To elucidate molecular mechanisms of this process, we are examining the in vitro folding and stability properties of a series of human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) sequence variants which exhibit widely differing tendencies to form inclusion bodies. Of 67 variants surveyed, nine, including wild type, were purified and their in vitro stability properties determined. One of these, a high inclusion body mutant, exhibited very low solubility in native buffer after purification and was not pursued further. For the other eight sequence variants, no strong correlations were observed between extent of inclusion body formation and either thermodynamic or thermal stability. In particular, a Lys97-->Val mutation produces substantially more IL-1 beta in inclusion bodies than the wild type (61 versus 8%) despite generating a protein more thermodynamically stable than wild type. Furthermore, the Lys97-->Val mutant forms substantial levels of inclusion bodies at 32 degrees C but requires incubation at temperatures greater than 48 degrees C for thermally induced aggregation in vitro. This and other data suggest that the tendency of at least some IL-1 beta variants to form inclusion bodies is most likely related to the stability or solubility of folding intermediates rather than native states.

Three endothermic transitions are observed in whole Cl-s near 37, 49, and 60 degrees C in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.22 M NaCl and 0.1 mM EDTA. The first (37 degrees C) and third (60 degrees C) transitions are also seen in Cl-s-A, a derivative comprised mainly of the intact nonenzymatic A chain. The second (49 degrees C) and third transitions are seen in Cl-s-gamma B, a fragment comprised of the intact B chain, disulfide linked to the C-terminal gamma region of the A chain. Thus, the first transition, which is alone stabilized by Ca2+, corresponds to the melting of the N-terminal alpha beta region of the A chain, the second to the melting of the catalytic B chain domain, and the third to the gamma region. The gamma region is comprised of two homologous short consensus repeat (SCR) motifs that are also found in several other complement and coagulation proteins. A new 24-kDa fragment, Cl-s-gamma, which contains these two SCRs, was isolated from plasmic and chymotryptic digests of Cl-s-A.

Circular dichroism (CD), absorption, and fluorescence spectra were recorded during temperature-induced unfolding at different urea concentrations and during urea-induced unfolding at different temperatures. The first three vectors obtained by singular-value decomposition of each set of unfolding spectra were incorporated into a global analysis of a unique thermodynamic model. Although individual unfolding profiles can be described as a two-state process, a simultaneous fit of 99 vectors requires a three-state model as the minimal scheme to describe the unfolding reaction along both perturbation axes. The model, which involves native (N), intermediate (I), and unfolded (U) states, predicts a maximum apparent stability, DeltaG degrees (NU), of 6 kcal mol(-)(1) at 15 degrees C, an apparent m(NU) value of 2 kcal mol(-)(1) M(-)(1), and an apparent heat capacity change, DeltaC(p)()(-NU), of 2.5 kcal mol(-)(1) K(-)(1). The intermediate species has a maximum stability of approximately 2 kcal mol(-)(1) and a compactness closer to that of the native than to that of the unfolded state. The population of the intermediate is maximal ( approximately 70%) around 50 degrees C and falls below the limits of detection of > or =2 M urea or at temperatures of <35 or >65 degrees C. The fluorescence properties of the equilibrium intermediate resemble those of a transient intermediate detected during refolding from the urea-denatured state, suggesting that a tryptophan-containing hydrophobic cluster in the adenosine-binding domain plays a key role in both the equilibrium and kinetic reactions. The CD spectroscopic properties of the native state reveal the presence of two principal isoforms that differ in ligand binding affinities and in the packing of the adenosine-binding domain. The relative populations of these species change slightly with temperature and do not depend on the urea concentration, implying that the two native isoforms are well-structured and compact. Global analysis of data from multiple spectroscopic probes and several methods of unfolding is a powerful tool for revealing structural and thermodynamic properties of partially and fully folded forms of DHFR.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the aggregation of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhGCSF), a protein that rapidly aggregates and precipitates at pH 6.9 and 37 degrees C. We observed that native monomeric rhGCSF reversibly forms a dimer under physiological conditions and that this dimeric species does not participate in the irreversible aggregation process. Sucrose, a thermodynamic stabilizer, inhibits the aggregation of rhGCSF. We postulate that sucrose acts by reducing the concentration of structurally expanded species, consistent with the hypothesis that preferential exclusion favors most compact species in the native state ensemble. Thermodynamic stability data from unfolding curves and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experimental results support the above hypothesis. Thus, the strategy of stabilizing the native state of the protein under physiological conditions using thermodynamic stabilizers, especially ligands binding with high affinity to the native state, is expected to protect against protein aggregation occurring under such nonperturbing solution conditions.",

        "abstract": "Spherulin 3a (S3a) from Physarum polycephalum represents the only known single-domain member of the superfamily of beta gamma eye-lens crystallins. It shares the typical two Greek-key motif and is stabilized by dimerization and Ca(2+)-binding. The temperature and denaturant-induced unfolding of S3a in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+ were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. To accomplish reversibility without chemical modification of the protein during thermal denaturation, the only cysteine residue (Cys4) was substituted by serine; apart from that, the protein was destabilized by adding 0.5-1.8 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The Cys4Ser mutant was found to be indistinguishable from natural S3a. The equilibrium unfolding transitions obey the two-state model according to N2-->2 U, allowing thermodynamic parameters to be determined by linear extrapolation to zero GdmCl concentration. The corresponding transition temperatures TM for the Ca(2+)-free and Ca(2+)-loaded protein were found to be 65 and 85 degrees C, the enthalpy changes delta Hcal, 800 and 1280 kJ/mol(dimer), respectively. The strong dependencies of TM and delta Hcal on the GdmCl concentration allow the molar heat capacity change delta Cp to be determined. As a result, delta Cp = 18 kJ/(K mol(dimer)) was calculated independent of Ca2+. No significant differences were obtained between the free energy delta G degree calculated from delta Hcal and TM, and extrapolated from the stability curves in the presence of different amounts of denaturant. The free energy derived from thermal unfolding was confirmed by the spectral results obtained from GdmCl-induced equilibrium transitions at different temperatures for the Ca(2+)-free or the Ca(2+)-loaded protein, respectively. Within the limits of error, the delta G degree values extrapolated from the transitions of chemical denaturation to zero denaturant concentration are identical with the calorimetric results.",

        "abstract": "The thermodynamics and kinetics of folding of common-type acylphosphatase have been studied under a variety of experimental conditions and compared with those of the homologous muscle acylphosphatase. Intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism have been used as spectroscopic probes to follow the folding and unfolding reactions. Both proteins appear to fold via a two-state mechanism. Under all the conditions studied, common-type acylphosphatase possesses a lower conformational stability than the muscle form. Nevertheless, common-type acylphosphatase folds more rapidly, suggesting that the conformational stability and the folding rate are not correlated in contrast to recent observations for a number of other proteins. The unfolding rate of common-type acylphosphatase is much higher than that of the muscle enzyme, indicating that the differences in conformational stability between the two proteins are primarily determined by differences in the rate of unfolding. The equilibrium m value is markedly different for the two proteins in the pH range of maximum conformational stability (5. 0-7.5); above pH 8.0, the m value for common-type acylphosphatase decreases abruptly and becomes similar to that of the muscle enzyme. Moreover, at pH 9.2, the dependencies of the folding and unfolding rate constants of common-type acylphosphatase on denaturant concentration (mf and mu values, respectively) are notably reduced with respect to pH 5.5. The pH-induced decrease of the m value can be attributed to the deprotonation of three histidine residues that are present only in the common-type isoenzyme. This would decrease the positive net charge of the protein, leading to a greater compactness of the denatured state. The folding and unfolding rates of common-type acylphosphatase are not, however, significantly different at pH 5.5 and 9.2, indicating that this change in compactness of the denatured and transition states does not have a notable influence on the rate of protein folding.",

        "abstract": "The residue Asp87, which is in the calcium-binding loop of bovine alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) and provides a side-chain carboxylate oxygen for ligand Ca(II) co-ordination, was substituted by either alanine or asparagine. The physical properties and calcium-binding affinities were monitored by intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. D87A alpha-LA displayed a total loss of rigid tertiary structure, a dramatic loss in secondary structure and negligible calcium affinity [Anderson et al. (1997) Biochemistry, 36, 11648-11654]. On the contrary, D87N alpha-LA displayed native-like secondary structure with a somewhat de-stabilized tertiary structure. When the well-documented N-terminal methionine was enzymatically removed from D87N alpha-LA [Veprintsev et al. (1999) PROTEINS: Struct. Funct. Genet., 37, 65-72], the structure appeared to more closely resemble native alpha-LA. Remarkably, the thermal transition mid-temperature of apo-desMetD87N alpha-LA was approximately 31 degrees C versus native apo- alpha-LA (approximately 25 degrees C), probably due to negative charge 'compensation' in the calcium co-ordination site. On the other hand, the transition mid-temperature of Ca(II)-bound desMetD87N alpha-LA was approximately 57 degrees C versus native alpha-LA (approximately 66 degrees C), which was related to a decreased Ca(II) affinity (K = approximately 2.1 x 10(5) versus approximately 1.7 x 10(7)/M at 40 degrees C, respectively). These results reaffirm that alanine substitution in site specific mutagenesis is not always a prudent choice. Substitutions must be conservative with only minimal changes in functional groups and side-chain volume.",

        "abstract": "The gene-3 protein (G3P) of filamentous phages is essential for the infection of Escherichia coli. The carboxy-terminal domain anchors this protein in the phage coat, whereas the two amino-terminal domains N1 and N2 protrude from the phage surface. We analyzed the folding mechanism of the two-domain fragment N1-N2 of G3P (G3P(*)) and the interplay between folding and domain assembly. For this analysis, a variant of G3P(*) was used that contained four stabilizing mutations (IIHY-G3P(*)). The observed refolding kinetics extend from 10 ms to several hours. Domain N1 refolds very rapidly (with a time constant of 9.4 ms at 0.5 M guanidinium chloride, 25 degrees C) both as a part of IIHY-G3P(*) and as an isolated protein fragment. The refolding of domain N2 is slower and involves two reactions with time constants of seven seconds and 42 seconds. These folding reactions of the individual domains are followed by a very slow, spectroscopically silent docking process, which shows a time constant of 6200 seconds. This reaction was detected by a kinetic unfolding assay for native molecules. Before docking, N1 and N2 unfold fast and independently, after docking they unfold slowly in a correlated fashion. A high energy barrier is thus created by domain docking, which protects G3P kinetically against unfolding. The slow domain docking is possibly important for the infection of E.coli by the phage. Upon binding to the F pilus, the N2 domain separates from N1 and the binding site for TolA on domain N1 is exposed. Since domain reassembly is so slow, this binding site remains accessible until pilus retraction has brought N1 close to TolA on the bacterial surface.",

These mutants were selected because they are known to affect the activity of the enzyme. The structural differences were evaluated by using peptide backbone and side-chain \"marker\" bands as conformation-sensitive monitors. All mutations lead to a decrease of the thermal transition temperature, though the mutation Tyr-45-->Trp affects the Tm to a lesser degree than the replacement of Trp-59 by Tyr, both in the single (W59Y) and in the double (Y45W/W59Y) mutant. Small changes in the protein backbone conformation and in the microenvironment of certain amino acids, induced by the point mutations, could be detected. In particular, we found subtle differences in the hydrogen bonding pattern of the beta-strands in the mutants W59Y and Y45W/W59Y, compared to that in wild-type RNase T1 and in the mutant Y45W. Practically identical spectra in the amide I region were obtained for the double mutant Y45W/W59Y and the single mutant W59Y, demonstrating that it is the change from Trp to Tyr in position 59 (located at the interface between the alpha-helix and a beta-strand) which affects the overall protein conformation. The mutation Tyr to Trp in position 45, on the other hand, has practically no impact on the polypeptide backbone conformation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Substitution of Thr26 by Gln in the lysozyme of bacteriophage T4 produces an enzyme with greatly reduced activity but essentially unaltered stability relative to wild type. Spontaneous second-site revertants of the mutant were selected genetically; two of them were chosen for structural and biochemical characterization. One revertant bears (in addition to the primary mutation) the substitution Tyr18----His, the other, Tyr18----Asp. The primary mutant and both revertant lysozyme genes were reconstructed in a plasmid-based expression system, and the proteins were produced and purified. The two revertant lysozymes exhibit enzymatic activities intermediate between wild type and the primary mutant; both also exhibit melting temperatures approximately 3 degrees C lower than either the wild type or the primary mutant. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained from both revertant lysozymes, but not the primary mutant. Structures of the double mutant lysozymes were refined at 1.8-A resolution to crystallographic residuals of 15.1% (Tyr18----His) and 15.2% (Tyr18----Asp). Model building suggests that the side chain of Gln26 in the primary mutant is forced to protrude into the active site cleft, resulting in low catalytic activity. In contrast, the crystal structures of the revertants reveal that the double substitutions (Gln26 and His18, or Gln26 and Asp18) fit into the same space that is occupied by Thr26 and Tyr18 in the wild-type enzyme; the effect is a restructuring of the surface of the active site cleft, with essentially no perturbation of the polypeptide backbone. This restructuring is effected by a novel series of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions that apparently stabilize the revertant structures.",

Fluorescence maxima at 315-320 nm and 330-335 nm indicate a more hydrophobic environment or a more effective stacking of Trp residues in mutants [F29W]HBsu and [F50W]HBsu in comparison to [F47W]HBsu and [F79W]HBsu, respectively. Unfolding of the mutants in high-ionic-strength buffers by increasing concentrations of urea results in a red shift of the fluorescence emission maxima to about 350 nm; the fluorescence intensities decrease strongly for [F29W]HBsu and [F50W]HBsu but show a small increase for [F47W]HBsu and [F79W]HBsu. The data suggest complex unfolding patterns with subtle differences between the single mutants. The circular dichroic spectra in the region 250-320 nm are dominated by the effects of the Trp residues and signal position-dependent differences in the environment of the Trp residues. The conformations of the mutant proteins depend on the ionic strength of the buffer and become more stable against unfolding by denaturants or increasing temperatures at higher ionic strength. At low ionic strength a pronounced protein-concentration dependence of the conformation of the mutants is seen.",

The H. grisea enzyme was much more stable to irreversible thermal denaturation than the Trichoderma reesei enzyme. It had an apparent denaturation midpoint (T(m)) of 68.7 degrees C, 14.3 degrees C higher than the T. reesei enzyme. There are an additional three cysteines found in the H. grisea Cel12A enzyme. To determine their importance for thermal stability, we constructed three H. grisea Cel12A single mutants in which these cysteines were exchanged with the corresponding residues in the T. reesei enzyme. We also introduced these cysteine residues into the T. reesei enzyme. The thermal stability of these variants was determined. Substitutions at any of the three positions affected stability, with the largest effect seen in H. grisea C206P, which has a T(m) 9.1 degrees C lower than that of the wild type. The T. reesei cysteine variant that gave the largest increase in stability, with a T(m) 3.9 degrees C higher than wild type, was the P201C mutation, the converse of the destabilizing C206P mutation in H. grisea. To help rationalize the results, we have determined the crystal structure of the H. grisea enzyme and of the most stable T. reesei cysteine variant, P201C. The three cysteines in H. grisea Cel12A play an important role in the thermal stability of this protein, although they are not involved in a disulfide bond.",

To assess the specific influence of variations in amino acid sequence on the mechanism for protein folding, circularly permuted variants of RNase T1 were constructed and characterized in terms of catalytic activity and thermodynamic stability. The disulfide bond connecting Cys-2 and Cys-10 was removed by mutation of these residues to alanine (C2, 10A) to avoid potential steric problems imposed by the circular permutations. The original amino-terminus and carboxyl-terminus of the mutant (C2, 10A) were subsequently joined with a tripeptide linker to accommodate a reverse turn and new termini were introduced throughout the primary sequence in regions of solvent-exposed loops at Ser-35 (cp35S1), Asp-49 (cp49D1), Gly-70 (cp70G1), and Ser-96 (cp96S1). These circularly permuted RNase T1 mutants retained 35-100% of the original catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of guanylyl(3'-->5')cytidine, suggesting that the overall tertiary fold of these mutants is very similar to that of wild-type protein. Chemical denaturation curves indicated thermodynamic stabilities at pH 5.0 of 5.7, 2.9, 2.6, and 4.6 kcal/mol for cp35S1, cp49D1, cp70G1, and cp96S1, respectively, compared to a value of 10.1 kcal/mol for wild-type RNase T1 and 6.4 kcal/mol for (C2, 10A) T1. A fifth set of circularly permuted variants was attempted with new termini positioned in a tight beta-turn between Glu-82 and Gln-85. New termini were inserted at Asn-83 (cp83N1), Asn-84 (cp84N1), and Gln-85 (cp85Q1). No detectable amount of protein was ever produced for any of the mutations in this region, suggesting that this turn may be critical for the proper folding and/or thermodynamic stability of RNase T1.",

Here, we use (17)O and (2)H magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) to study urea-induced denaturation of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP). MRD is among the few methods that can provide molecular-level information about protein solvation in native as well as denatured states, and it is used here to simultaneously monitor the interactions of urea and water with the unfolding protein. Whereas CD shows an apparently two-state transition, MRD reveals a more complex process involving at least two intermediates. At least one water molecule binds persistently (with residence time >10 nsec) to the protein even in 7.5 M urea, where the large internal binding cavity is disrupted and CD indicates a fully denatured protein. This may be the water molecule buried near the small hydrophobic folding core at the D-E turn in the native protein. The MRD data also provide insights about transient (residence time <1 nsec) interactions of urea and water with the native and denatured protein. In the denatured state, both water and urea rotation is much more retarded than for a fully solvated polypeptide. The MRD results support a picture of the denatured state where solvent penetrates relatively compact clusters of polypeptide segments.",

The kinetics was found to be independent of protein concentration and salt concentration, but was strongly dependent on temperature. For highly pure ovalbumin, the decrease in nondenatured native protein showed first-order dependence. The activation energy obtained with different techniques varied between 430 and 490 kJ*mole(-1). First-order behavior was studied in detail using differential scanning calorimetry. The calorimetric traces were irreversible and highly scan rate-dependent. The shape of the thermograms as well as the scan rate dependence can be explained by assuming that the thermal denaturation takes place according to a simplified kinetic process where N is the native state, D is denatured (or another final state) and k a first-order kinetic constant that changes with temperature, according to the Arrhenius equation. A kinetic model for the temperature-induced denaturation and aggregation of ovalbumin is presented. Commercially obtained ovalbumin was found to contain an intermediate-stable fraction (IS) of about 20% that was unable to form aggregates.

In the concentration range 0.6-7.3 mg mL-1, the denaturation of this hexameric enzyme was completely irreversible as judged by the absence of any endotherm on rescanning of previously scanned samples. However, the study of the effect of scanning rate on DSC curves indicated that the denaturation of G6PD is, most likely, a complex process which includes transitions in equilibrium as well as an irreversible step; in addition, it was found that application of the equilibrium formalism to the analysis of calorimetric data seems to be justified in this case, provided that scanning rates used are above 0.75 K min-1. The calorimetric and van't Hoff enthalpies for G6PD were 1260 +/- 118 and 160 +/- 27 kcal mol-1, respectively, indicating the presence of intermediates in the process. Accordingly, the DSC curves were adequately fitted to a model including six two-state sequential transitions. The observed protein-concentration dependence of the temperature at the maximum heat capacity, Tm, for each of the individual transitions suggests that G6PD dissociates to dimers in two consecutive steps. Using a model that includes dissociation explicitly, we calculated the thermodynamic parameters for each step. From this data, the enthalpy and free energy for the disruption of one dimer-dimer contact were roughly estimated, at pH 7.1 and 51 degrees C, as 57 and 2.1 kcal mol-1, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The terminal regions of monomeric hook protein from Salmonella typhimurium are known to be highly mobile and exposed to the solvent. Although hook protein exhibits an unusual far-UV circular dichroism spectrum, resembling that of random coil structures, our calorimetric experiments clearly demonstrate that the molecule has a compact ordered core. The compact part probably consists of three domains as suggested by deconvolution analysis of the calorimetric melting profiles. Secondary structure prediction, together with the analysis of far-UV circular dichroism spectra, has shown that the domains of monomeric hook protein contain beta-sheeted structures without significant alpha-helical content. The polymerization of hook protein is accompanied by the stabilization of its disordered terminal regions into a predominantly alpha-helical domain. Evaluation of circular dichroism data suggests that about 45 terminal residues are involved in helical segments. Coiled-coil prediction indicates that whereas the whole carboxy-terminal helical region of hook protein has a strong bundle-forming potential, there is only a single short amino-terminal segment exhibiting weak coiled-coil forming tendencies. The formation of alpha-helical bundles is commonly believed to be a key event during the polymerization of the axial structure of bacterial flagella. To clarify the role of helical bundle formation in hook assembly, proteolytic fragments of hook protein with truncations of various lengths in their carboxy-terminal disordered regions were generated, and their polymerization behavior was investigated. We found that even fragments completely lacking the main helix-forming carboxy-terminal regions can polymerize into filaments in vitro under appropriately high salt concentrations. Our results suggest that, although helical bundle formation may occur during self-assembly, governing precise subunit packing and playing an important role in the stabilization of hook filaments, it is not the principal interaction mainly responsible for the development of their filamentous structure.",

        "abstract": "The 64-residue protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) is a single module of structure. It folds and unfolds as a single co-operative unit by simple two-state kinetics via a single rate determining transition state. This transition state has been characterized at the level of individual residues by analysis of the rates and equilibria of folding of some 100 mutants strategically distributed at 45 sites throughout the protein. Only one residue, a helical residue (Ala16) buried in the hydrophobic core, has its full native interaction energy in the transition state. The only region of structure which is well developed in the transition state is the alpha-helix (residues 12 to 24). But, the interactions within it are weakened, especially at the C-terminal region. The rest of the protein has varying degrees of weakly formed structure. Thus, secondary and tertiary interactions appear to form concurrently. These data, reinforced by studies on the structures of peptide fragments, fit a \"nucleation-condensation\" model in which the overall structure condenses around an element of structure, the nucleus, that itself consolidates during the condensation. The high energy transition state is composed of the whole of the molecule making a variety of weak interactions, the nucleus being those residues that make the strongest interactions. The nucleus here is part of the alpha-helix and some distant residues in the sequence with which it makes contacts. The remainder of the protein has to be sufficiently ordered that it provides the necessary interactions to stabilize the nucleus. The nucleus is only weakly formed in the denatured state but develops in the transition state. The onrush of stability as the nucleus consolidates its local and long range interactions is so rapid that it is not yet fully formed in the transition state. The formation of the nucleus is thus coupled with the condensation. These results are consistent with a recent simulation of the folding of a computer model protein on a lattice which is found to proceed by a nucleation-growth mechanism. We suggest that the mechanism of folding of CI2 may be a common theme in protein folding whereby fundamental folding units of larger proteins, which are modelled by the folding of CI2, form by nucleation-condensation events and coalesce, perhaps in a hierarchical manner.",

        "abstract": "The protein stabilities of wild type and four site-directed mutants of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c2 have been characterized. The integrity of the cytochrome c2 iron-sulfur environment was ascertained by titration of the 696-nm absorbance band with alkali, and the conformational stability was determined by titration of the 220-nm circular dichroism signal with Gdn-HCl. Analysis of the alkaline transition pK value of K12D (lysine-12 substituted by aspartate) indicated that the K12D iron-sulfur environment was destabilized by 0.6 kcal/mol relative to the wild-type cytochrome c2 at low ionic strength. In contrast, the alkaline transition pK values of K14E (lysine-14 substituted by glutamate), K32E (lysine-32 substituted by glutamate), and K14E/K32E (lysines-14 and -32 substituted by glutamates) were indistinguishable from the wild type, indicating that these substitutions have no effect on the stability of the iron-sulfur environment. Gdn-HCl denaturation of K12D and K14E indicated that both these mutations decreased conformational stability by 1.3 kcal/mol. In contrast, mutant K32E exhibited a small stabilizing effect of 0.2 kcal/mol. Gdn-HCl denaturation of K14E/K32E indicated that this mutation decreased conformational stability by 1.3 kcal/mol, which is consistent with the additive effects of the single charge mutations at positions 14 and 32. The conformational instability of mutants possessing negative charges at position 12 or 14 is best explained by their positioning at the carboxy-terminal region of the amino-terminal alpha-helix of R. capsulatus cytochrome c2. Accordingly, introduction of negatively charged groups into this region appears to destabilize cytochrome c2 through energetically unfavorable interactions with the dipole of the amino-terminal helix.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

H(A12-M) delta F14 is constructed by the fusion of 12 N-terminal amino acids of AMY with amino acids 13-214 of MAC, and by deletion of F14. In H(A12-M) delta Y13F14A, the N-terminal region of MAC is exchanged against the AMY sequence, Y13 is deleted, and Phe 14 is exchanged against Ala. The sequence of the N-terminal loop region from Pro 9 to amino acid 16 (or 17) is very important for the properties of the enzymes and influences the effects of Ca2+ ions on the thermostability and unfolding behavior of the enzymes. The half transition temperatures T(m) are higher in the presence of Ca2+ than in Ca2+ free buffer. Furthermore, the unfolding mechanism is influenced by Ca2+. In Ca(2+)-free buffer, MAC, H(A12-M) delta F14 and H(A12-M) delta Y13F14A unfold in a single cooperative transition from the folded state to the unfolded state, whereas for AMY, a two-step unfolding was found. In the presence of Ca2+, the two-step unfolding of AMY is strengthened. Furthermore, for H(A12-M) delta F14, a two-step unfolding is induced by Ca2+. These data indicate a two-domain structure of AMY and H(A12-M) delta F14, in the presence of Ca2+. Thus, point mutations in a peripheral loop region are decisive for thermal stabilities and unfolding mechanisms of the studied glucanases in the presence of Ca2+.",

        "abstract": "Competing views of the products of sub-millisecond folding reactions observed in many globular proteins have been ascribed either to the formation of discrete, partially folded states or to the random collapse of the unfolded chain under native-favoring conditions. To test the validity of these alternative interpretations for the stopped-flow burst-phase reaction in the (betaalpha)8, TIM barrel motif, a series of alanine replacements were made at five different leucine or isoleucine residues in the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase (alphaTS) from Escherichia coli. This protein has been proposed to fold, in the sub-millisecond time range, to an off-pathway intermediate with significant stability and approximately 50% of the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) signal of the native conformation. Individual alanine replacements at any of three isoleucine or leucine residues in either alpha1, beta2 or beta3 completely eliminate the off-pathway species. These variants, within 5 ms, access an intermediate whose properties closely resemble those of an on-pathway equilibrium intermediate that is highly populated at moderate urea concentrations in wild-type alphaTS. By contrast, alanine replacements for leucine residues in either beta4 or beta6 destabilize but preserve the off-pathway, burst-phase species. When considered with complementary thermodynamic and kinetic data, this mutational analysis demonstrates that the sub-millisecond appearance of CD signal for alphaTS reflects the acquisition of secondary structure in a distinct thermodynamic state, not the random collapse of an unfolded chain. The contrasting results for replacements in the contiguous alpha1/beta2/beta3 domain and the C-terminal beta4 and beta6 strands imply a heterogeneous structure for the burst-phase species. The alpha1/beta2/beta3 domain appears to be tightly packed, and the C terminus appears to behave as a molten-globule-like structure whose folding is tightly coupled to that of the alpha1/beta2/beta3 domain.",

        "abstract": "It is proposed that the stability of a protein can be increased by selected amino acid substitutions that decrease the configurational entropy of unfolding. Two such substitutions, one of the form Xaa----Pro and the other of the form Gly----Xaa, were constructed in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme at sites consistent with the known three-dimensional structure. Both substitutions stabilize the protein toward reversible and irreversible thermal denaturation at physiological pH. The substitutions have no effect on enzymatic activity. High-resolution crystallographic analysis of the proline-containing mutant protein (Ala-82----Pro) shows that its three-dimensional structure is essentially identical with the wild-type enzyme. The overall structure of the other mutant enzyme (Gly-77----Ala) is also very similar to wild-type lysozyme, although there are localized conformational adjustments in the vicinity of the altered amino acid. The combination of a number of such amino acid replacements, each of which is expected to contribute approximately 1 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) to the free energy of folding, may provide a general strategy for substantial improvement in the stability of a protein.",

E. coli strain MIC3001, which shows an RNase H-dependent, temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, was used for this purpose. Introduction of the rnhA gene permits the growth of this temperature-sensitive strain, whereas the gene for the truncated protein, 142-RNase HI, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal 13 residues, cannot. Analyses of the production levels and the stability of a series of mutant proteins with COOH-terminal truncations suggested that 142-RNase HI is nonfunctional in vivo because of a dramatic decrease in the protein stability. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated random mutagenesis of the rnhA142 gene, encoding 142-RNase HI, followed by selection of revertants, allowed us to isolate 11 single amino acid substitutions that render 142-RNase HI functional in vivo. Of them, eight substitutions were shown to enhance the thermal stability of the wild-type RNase HI protein, and of these, six were novel. The genetic selection strategy employed in this experiment was thus shown to be effective for identifying amino acid substitutions that enhance the thermal stability of E. coli RNase HI. Such a strategy would be versatile if a protein of interest could be destabilized by a deletion or a truncation and a conditional-lethal strain were available.",

        "abstract": "Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is a very stable dimer. In order to understand better the importance of dimerization for stability and catalytic activity, we have constructed a monomeric double-mutation variant. The dimer interface residues Thr75 and Gly76, which are at the tip of loop 3, have been substituted by an arginine and a glutamate, respectively. In wild type TIM, these two residues are at a distance of 27 A from the active site (as measured within the same subunit). This new variant, RE-TIM, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and biochemically characterized. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation runs showed that RE-TIM is a monomer in solution. Far-UV CD spectra indicate that this new variant is folded properly and that the secondary structure contents of RE-TIM are similar to those of wild type TIM. The monomeric RE-TIM has residual TIM activity. The thermal stability of RE-TIM is lower than that for wild type TIM. CD melting curves for RE-TIM and wild type TIM show Tm values of 52 and 57 degrees C, respectively, in the presence of the active site ligand 2-phosphoglycolate at 1 mM. Previously, we have characterized two other monomeric forms of TIM: monoTIM and H47N-TIM. The properties of RE-TIM, H47N-TIM, and monoTIM are compared, and it is argued that the properties of RE-TIM will be very similar to those of wild type monomeric subunits. This implies that wild type monomeric subunits have some stability and are catalytically active. It is also inferred that these monomeric subunits have flexible loops which rigidify at the dimer interface on dimerization, causing a 1000-fold increase of kcat and a 10-fold decrease of Km.",

The mutation, however, led to a significant decrease in the stability of the native state relative to both the thermodynamically stable intermediate and the fully unfolded state of the protein. In contrast to the two slower phases seen in the refolding of the wild-type enzyme, only one phase was detected in the refolding of the mutant, indicating a determining role of proline 167 in the kinetics of folding of the wild-type enzyme. The former phases are replaced by rapid refolding when the enzyme is unfolded for short periods of time, but the latter is independent of the time of unfolding. The monophasic refolding reaction of the mutant is proposed to reflect mainly the trans-->cis isomerization of the Glu166-Thr167 peptide bond.",

The denaturation transition may be fitted by a simple two-state model. The total free energy change from the native to the unfolded state was 9.4 +/- 0.4 kcal.mol-1, while a lower value (6.4 +/- 0.4 kcal.mol-1) was obtained for the metal depleted enzyme (apo-azurin) suggesting that the copper atom plays an important stabilization role. Azurin and apo-azurin were practically unaffected by hydrostatic pressure up to 3000 bar. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to destabilize the hydrophobic core of azurin. In particular either hydrophobic residue Ile7 or Phe110 has been substituted with a serine. The free energy change of unfolding by guanidinium hydrochloride, resulted to be 5.8 +/- 0.3 kcal.mol-1 and 4.8 +/- 0.3 kcal.mol-1 for Ile7Ser and Phe110Ser, respectively, showing that both mutants are much less stable than the wild-type protein. The mutated apoproteins could be reversible denatured even by high pressure, as demonstrated by steady-state fluorescence measurements. The change in volume associated to the pressure-induced unfolding was estimated to be -24 mL.mol-1 for Ile7Ser and -55 mL.mol-1 for Phe110Ser. These results show that the tight packing of the hydrophobic residues that characterize the inner structure of azurin is fundamental for the protein stability. This suggests that the proper assembly of the hydrophobic core is one of the earliest and most crucial event in the folding process, bearing important implication for de novo design of proteins.",

A. aeolicus PD is susceptible to proteolysis. In this report, the properties of the full-length PD are compared with one of these products, an N-terminally truncated protein variant (Delta19PD) also expressed recombinantly in E. coli. Both forms are dimeric and show maximum activity at 95 degrees C or higher. Delta19PD is more sensitive to temperature effects yielding a half-life of 55 min at 95 degrees C versus 2 h for PD, and values of kcat and Km for prephenate, which are twice those determined for PD at 80 degrees C. Low concentrations of guanidine-HCl activate enzyme activity, but at higher concentrations activity is lost concomitant with a multi-state pathway of denaturation that proceeds through unfolding of the dimer, oligomerization, then unfolding of monomers. Measurements of steady-state fluorescence intensity and its quenching by acrylamide in the presence of Gdn-HCl suggest that, of the two tryptophan residues per monomer, one is buried in a hydrophobic pocket and does not become solvent exposed until the protein unfolds, while the less buried tryptophan is at the active site. Tyrosine is a feedback inhibitor of PD activity over a wide temperature range and enhances the cooperativity between subunits in the binding of prephenate. Properties of this thermostable PD are compared and contrasted with those of E. coli chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase and other mesophilic homologs.",

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of native Escherichia coli 5-enolpyruvoyl shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, its binary complex with shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and its ternary complex with S3P and glyphosate have been studied using highly-sensitive differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All observed transitions are strongly scanning-rate-dependent and irreversible. Consistent with these observations, the data were better fit by a simple irreversible model than by the controversial reversible model more commonly employed. The results obtained provide additional support for the application of irreversible models to the thermal denaturation of proteins. The calculated parameters, activation energy (Ea), enthalpy of denaturation (delta H) and transition temperature (Tm), obtained from fitting to an irreversible model agree well with values obtained from approximation techniques. Further, the results show that the formation of the ternary complex greatly enhances the thermal stability of the enzyme (delta Tm = 10.6 degrees C), while the binding of S3P alone increases the transition temperature only slightly (delta Tm = 3 degrees C). The heat of binding calculated at the transition temperature also demonstrates the greater stability of the ternary complex (delta H = -70 kcal/mol) versus the binary complex (delta H = -10 kcal/mol).",

We demonstrate that the chimeric protein is correctly folded and exhibits the common thioredoxin architecture. However, the stability of the hybrid protein toward thermal and chemical denaturation is clearly reduced when compared with both parent proteins. Altogether, our data indicate that the interface between the two folding units of thioredoxin is tolerant toward changes in exact interdigitation of side chains, allowing for the formation of the unique overall thioredoxin fold. Further, the gene encoding the human-E. coli chimera was tested in vivo whether it supports the assembly of filamentous phages. No complementation of a thioredoxin-deficient E. coli mutant for the replication of the phages M13 or fd was observed, suggesting that parts of the overall protein structure in the N-terminal domain are crucial for this activity.",

        "abstract": "The ability of proteins to self-assemble into complex, functional nanoscale structures is expected to become of significant use in the manufacture of artificial nanodevices with a wide range of novel applications. The bacterial protein TRAP has potential uses as a nanoscale component as it is ring-shaped, with a central, modifiable cavity. Furthermore, it can be engineered to make a ring of 12-fold symmetry, which is advantageous for packing into two-dimensional arrays. The 12mer form of TRAP is made by linking multiple subunits together on the same polypeptide, but the usefulness of the 12mers described to date is limited by their poor stability. Here we show that, by altering the length of the peptide linker between subunits, the thermostability can be significantly improved. Since the subunit interfaces of the different 12mers are essentially identical, stabilization arises from the reduction of strain in the linkers. Such a simple method of controlling the stability of modular proteins may have wide applications, and demonstrates the lack of absolute correlation between interactions observable by crystallography and the internal energy of a complex.",

They bind to thermally unfolded proteins and can also assist refolding of denatured proteins. Mammalian small Hsps can form oligomeric structures of about 32 subunits. Until now, no data about cooperativity and stability of the interactions between the subunits of sHsps are available. To analyze these interactions we studied mouse Hsp25 and human Hsp27 by difference adiabatic scanning microcalorimetry (DASM) and circular dichroism (CD). Here we show that, according to DASM data, the minimum cooperatively melting structure is a sHsp-dimer. CD data indicate that Hsp25 major secondary structure, the beta-pleated conformation, is resistant to acidic influence up to pH 4.5 and, at neutral pH values, to heat treatment up to 60 degrees C. The melting pattern of Hsp25/27 bears resemblance to alpha-crystallins. CD data indicate similar secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of the proteins compared. This finding is in agreement with the revealed homology of primary structure of these proteins and their common chaperone function.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the factors governing the thermal stability of proteins and correlating them to the sequence and structure is a complex and multiple problem that can nevertheless provide important information on the molecular forces involved in protein folding. Here, we have carried out a comparative genomic study to analyze the effects that different intrinsic and environmental factors have on the thermal stability of frataxins, a family of small mitochondrial iron-binding proteins found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Low expression of frataxin in humans causes Friedreich's ataxia, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease. The human, yeast, and bacterial orthologues were selected as representatives of different evolutionary steps. Although sharing high sequence homology and the same three-dimensional fold, the three proteins have a large variability in their thermal stabilities. Whereas bacterial and human frataxins are thermally stable, well-behaved proteins, under the same conditions yeast frataxin exists in solution as an unstable species with apprechable tracts in a conformational exchange. By designing suitable mutants, we show and justify structurally that the length of the C-terminus is an important intrinsic factor that directly correlates with the thermal stabilities of the three proteins. Thermal stability is also gained by the addition of Fe(2+). This effect, however, is not uniform for the three orthologues nor highly specific for iron: a similar albeit weaker stabilization is observed with other mono- and divalent cations. We discuss the implications that our findings have for the role of frataxins as iron-binding proteins.",

        "abstract": "The energetic parameters for the folding of small globular proteins can be very different if derived from guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) or urea denaturation experiments. A study of the equilibrium and kinetics of the refolding of wild-type (wt) cytochrome c(551) (cyt c(551)) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and of two site-directed mutants (E70Q and E70V) shows that the nonionic nature of urea reveals the role of a salt bridge between residues E70 and K10 on the transition state, which is otherwise completely masked in GdnHCl experiments. Mixed denaturant refolding experiments allow us to conclude that the masking effect of GdnHCl is complete at fairly low GdnHCl concentrations ( congruent with 0.1 M). The fact that potassium chloride is unable to reproduce this quenching effect, together with the results obtained on the mutants, suggests a specific binding of the Gdn(+) cation, which involves the E70-K10 ion pair in wt cyt c(551). We propose, therefore, a simple kinetic test to obtain a mechanistic interpretation of nonlinear dependences of DeltaG(w) on GdnHCl concentration on the basis of kinetic refolding experiments in the presence of both denaturants.",

N. (1986) Methods Enzymol. 131, 266-280]. We propose a practical solution to this problem and use it to test the dependence of DeltaGD of lysozyme, ribonuclease-A, and cytochrome-c on [urea], the molar urea concentration. This method employs (i) measurements of the urea-induced denaturation in the presence of different guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) concentrations which by themselves disrupt the native state of the protein at the same temperature and pH at which denaturations by urea and GdnHCl have been measured; (ii) estimation of DeltaGDcor, the value of DeltaGD corrected for the effect of GdnHCl on the urea-induced denaturation using the relation (DeltaGDcor = DeltaGD + mg [GdnHCl] = DeltaGD0 - mu [urea], where mg and mu are the dependencies of DeltaGD on [GdnHCl] and [urea], respectively) whose parameters are all determined from experimental denaturation data; and (iii) mapping of DeltaGDcor onto the DeltaGD versus [urea] plot obtained in the absence of GdnHCl. Our results convincingly show that (i) [urea] dependence of DeltaGD of each protein is linear over the full concentration range; (ii) the effect of urea and GdnHCl on protein denaturation is additive; and (iii) KCl affects the urea-induced denaturation if the native protein contains charge-charge interaction and/or anion binding site, in a manner which is consistent with the crystal structure data.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional modeling of the complex between retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) and retinoic acid suggests that binding of the ligand is mediated by interaction between the carboxyl group of retinoic acid and two charged amino acids (Arg-111 and Arg-131) whose side chains project into the barrel of the protein. To assess the contribution of these amino acids to protein-ligand interaction, amino acid substitutions were made by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis. The wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and subsequently purified. Like wild-type CRABP, the mutant proteins are composed mainly of beta-strands as determined by circular dichroism in the presence and absence of ligand, and thus presumably are folded into the same compact barrel structure as the wild-type protein. Mutants in which Arg-111 and Arg-131 are replaced by glutamine bind retinoic acid with significantly lower affinity than the wild-type protein, arguing that these two residues indeed interact with the ligand. The mutant proteins are more resistant to thermal denaturation than wild-type CRABP in the absence of retinoic acid, but they are not as thermostable as the CRABP-retinoic acid complex. These data suggest a model for CRABP-retinoic acid interaction in which the repulsive forces between the positively-charged arginine residues provide conformational flexibility to the native protein for retinoic acid to enter the binding pocket. Elimination of the positively-charged pair of amino acids produces a protein that is more thermostable than wild-type CRABP but less effective at ligand-binding.",

        "abstract": "The Factor for Inversion Stimulation (FIS) is a dimeric DNA binding protein found in enteric bacteria that is involved in various cellular processes, including stimulation of certain specialized DNA recombination events and transcription regulation of a large number of genes. The intracellular FIS concentration, when cells are grown in rich media, varies dramatically during the early logarithmic growth phase. Its broad range of concentrations could potentially affect the nature of its quaternary structure, which in turn, could affect its ability to function in vivo. Thus, we examined the stability of FIS homodimers under a wide range of concentrations relevant to in vivo expression levels. Its urea-induced equilibrium denaturation was monitored by far- and near-UV circular dichroism (CD), tyrosine fluorescence, and tyrosine fluorescence anisotropy. The denaturation transitions obtained were concentration-dependent and showed similar midpoints (C(m)) and m values, suggesting a two-state denaturation process involving the native dimer and unfolded monomers (N(2) <--> 2U). The DeltaG(H(2)O) for the unfolding of FIS determined from global and individual curve fitting was 14.2 kcal/mole. At concentrations <9 microM, the FIS dimer began to dissociate, as noted by the change in CD signal and size-exclusion high-pressure liquid chromatography retention times and peak width. The estimated dimer dissociation constant based on the CD and size-exclusion chromatography data is in the micromolar range, resulting in a DeltaG(H(2)O) of at least 5 kcal/mole less than that calculated from the urea denaturation data. This discrepancy suggests a deviation from a two-state denaturation model, perhaps due to a marginally stable monomeric intermediate. These observations have implications for the stability and function of FIS in vivo.",

        "abstract": "gamma B-crystallin is a monomeric member of the beta gamma-superfamily of vertebrate eye lens proteins. It consists of two similar domains with all-beta Greek key topology associating about an approximate two-fold axis. At pH 2, with urea as the denaturant, the domains show independent equilibrium unfolding transitions, suggesting different intrinsic stabilities. Denaturation experiments using recombinant one- or two-domain proteins showed that the N-terminal domain on its own exhibits unaltered intrinsic stability but contributes significantly to the stability of its C-terminal partner. It has been suggested that docking of the domains is determined by a hydrophobic interface that includes phenylalanine at position 56 of the N-terminal domain. In order to test this hypothesis, F56 was substituted by site-directed mutagenesis in both complete gamma B-crystallin and its isolated N-terminal domain. All mutations destabilize the N-terminal domain to about the same extent but affect the C-terminal domain in a different way. Replacement by the small alanine side chain or the charged aspartic acid residue results in a significant destabilization of the C-terminal domain, whereas the more bulky tryptophan residue causes only a moderate decrease in stability. In the mutants F56A and F56D, equilibrium unfolding transitions obtained by circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence differ, suggesting a more complex denaturation behavior than the one observed for gamma B wild type. These results confirm how mutations in one crystallin domain can affect the stability of another when they occur at the interface. The results strongly suggest that size, hydrophobicity, and optimal packing of amino acids involved in these interactions are critical for the stability of gamma B-crystallin.",

From this analysis, the contributions of the four phenylalanine and four tyrosine residues to the stabilities of the native protein and the disulfide-bonded folding intermediates were determined. While the substitutions were found to destabilize the native protein by 2 to 7 kcal/mol, they had significantly smaller effects on the intermediates that represent the earlier stages of folding, even when the site of the substitution was located within the ordered regions of the intermediates. These results suggest that stabilizing interactions contribute less to conformational stability in the context of a partially folded intermediate than in a fully folded native protein, perhaps because of decreased cooperativity among the individual interactions. The kinetic analysis also provides new information about the transition states associated with the slowest steps in folding and unfolding, supporting previous suggestions that these transition states are extensively unfolded. Although the substitutions caused large changes in the distribution of folding intermediates and in the rates of some steps in the folding pathway, the kinetically-preferred pathway for all of the variants involved intramolecular disulfide rearrangements, as observed previously for the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the predominance of the rearrangement mechanism reflects conformational constraints present relatively early in the folding pathway.",

The 156 amino acid residue protein is composed of four ankyrin repeats (a helix-turn-helix motif) that stack linearly as two four-helix bundles resulting in a non-globular, elongated molecule. The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the folding of p16 are unusual. The protein has a very low free energy of unfolding, Delta GH-2O/D-N, of 3.1 kcal mol-1 at 25 degreesC. The rate-determining transition state of folding/unfolding is very compact (89% as compact as the native state). The other unusual feature is the very rapid rate of unfolding in the absence of denaturant of 0.8 s-1 at 25 degreesC. Thus, p16 has both thermodynamic and kinetic instability. These features may be essential for the regulatory function of the INK4 proteins and of other ankyrin-repeat-containing proteins that mediate a wide range of protein-protein interactions. The mechanisms of inactivation of p16 by eight cancer-associated mutations were dissected using a systematic method designed to probe the integrity of the secondary structure and the global fold. The structure and folding of p16 appear to be highly vulnerable to single point mutations, probably as a result of the protein's low stability. This vulnerability provides one explanation for the striking frequency of p16 mutations in tumours and in immortalised cell lines.",

In addition, these two myoglobins unfold with greater cooperativity than previously characterized myoglobins. The data obtained herein demonstrate unequivocally for the first time that the stability of homeotherm myoglobins correlates with neither the size of the organism nor its metabolic rate.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics of folding of mPrP(121-231), the structured 111-residue domain of the murine cellular prion protein PrP(C), were investigated by stopped-flow fluorescence using the variant F175W, which has the same overall structure and stability as wild-type mPrP(121-231) but shows a strong fluorescence change upon unfolding. At 22 degrees C and pH 7.0, folding of mPrP(121-231)-F175W is too fast to be observable by stopped-flow techniques. Folding at 4 degrees C occurs with a deduced half-life of approximately 170 micros without detectable intermediates, possibly the fastest protein-folding reaction known so far. Thus, propagation of the abnormal, oligomeric prion protein PrP(Sc), which is supposed to be the causative agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, is unlikely to follow a mechanism where kinetic folding intermediates of PrP(C) are a source of PrP(Sc) subunits.",

        "title": "Transient intermediates in the folding of dihydrofolate reductase as detected by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopy.", 
        "abstract": "The kinetics of the reversible folding and unfolding of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase have been studied by stopped-flow circular dichroism in the peptide region at pH 7.8 and 15 degrees C. The reactions were induced by concentration jumps of a denaturant, urea. The method can detect various intermediates transiently populated in the reactions although the equilibrium unfolding of the protein is apparently approximated by a two-state reaction. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) From transient circular dichroism spectra measured as soon as the refolding is started, a substantial amount of secondary structure is formed in the burst phase, i.e., within the dead time of stopped-flow mixing (18 ms). (2) The kinetics from this burst-phase intermediate to the native state are multiphasic, consisting of five phases designated as tau 1, tau 2, tau 3, tau 4, and tau 5 in increasing order of the reaction rate. Measurements of the kinetics at various wavelengths have provided kinetic difference circular dichroism spectra for the individual phases. (3) The tau 5 phase shows a kinetic difference spectrum consistent with an exciton contribution of two aromatic residues in the peptide CD region. The absence of the tau 5 phase in a mutant protein, in which Trp 74 is replaced by leucine, suggests that Trp 74 is involved in the exciton pair and that the tau 5 phase reflects the formation of a hydrophobic cluster around Trp 74. From the similarity of the kinetic difference spectrum to the difference between the native spectra of the mutant and wild-type proteins, it appears that Trp 47 is the partner in the exciton pair and that the structure formed in the tau 5 phase persists during the later stages of folding. (4) The later stages of folding show kinetic difference spectra that can be interpreted by rearrangement of secondary structure, particularly the central beta sheet of the protein. The pairwise similarities in the spectrum between the tau 3 and tau 4 phases, and between the tau 1 and tau 2 phases, also suggest the presence of two parallel folding channels for refolding. (5) The unfolding kinetics show three to four phases and are interpreted in terms of the presence of multiple native species. The total ellipticity change in kinetic unfolding reaction, however, agrees with the ellipticity difference between the native and unfolding states, indicating the absence of the burst phase in unfolding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Improving hydrophobic packing at the dimerisation interface by a single substitution increases LacR heat-resistance by 40 deg. C without abolishing inducer binding at high and low temperatures. Tetrameric LacR mutants carrying substitutions of the positively charged amino acid Lys84 by each of the hydrophobic amino acids Leu, Ile and Met resist heating to temperatures up to 93 degrees C. We performed IPTG binding assays at 80 degrees C and found the mutant Lac repressors active and, thus, the core intact. Furthermore, the activity of LacR following heating is shown at room temperature by a gel retardation assay, which demonstrates normal oligomerisation state and function of the headpiece. The same mutations (K84L/I/M) in the dimer LacR331stop, carrying a stop codon in amino acid 331, increase thermostability of the dimer from 47 degrees C to 87 degrees C. LacRK84M represses beta-galactosidase activity in vivo as well as the wild-type and is sufficiently induced to allow growth on lactose.

        "abstract": "The unfolding of the recombinant regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase I was followed by monitoring the intrinsic protein fluorescence. Unfolding proceeds in at least two stages. First, the quenching of fluorescence due to cAMP binding is abolished at relatively low levels of urea (less than 2 M) and is observed as an increase in intensity at 340 nm. The high-affinity binding of cAMP is retained in 3 M urea even though the quenching is lost. The second stage of unfolding, presumably representing unfolding of the polypeptide chain, is seen as a shift in lambda max from 340 to 353 nm. The midpoint concentration, Cm, for this process is 5.0 M. Cyclic AMP binding activity is lost at a half-maximal urea concentration of 3.5 M and precedes the shift in lambda max. Unfolding of the protein in the presence of urea was fully reversible; furthermore, the presence of excess levels of cAMP stabilized the regulatory subunit. A free energy value (delta GDH2O) of 7.1 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol was calculated for the native form of the protein when denaturation was induced with either urea or guanidine hydrochloride. Iodide quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was used to elucidate the number of tryptophan residues accessible during various stages of the unfolding process. In the native cAMP-bound form of the regulatory subunit, only one of the three tryptophans in the regulatory subunit is quenched by iodide while more than two tryptophans can be quenched with iodide in the presence of 3 M urea.",

The relaxation kinetics were initiated using a laser-induced temperature jump and probed using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The kinetics monitored within the amide I' absorbance of the polypeptide backbone exhibit two distinct kinetics phases with nanosecond and microsecond relaxation times. The fast kinetics relaxation time is close to the diffusion limits placed on protein folding reactions. The fast kinetics phase is dominated by the relaxation of the solvated helix (nu = 1632 cm(-1)), which reports on the fast relaxation of the individual helices. The slow kinetics phase follows the cooperative relaxation of the native helical bundle core that is monitored by both solvated (nu = 1632 cm(-1)) and buried helical IR bands (nu = 1652 cm(-1)). The folding rates of the slow kinetics phase calculated over an extended temperature range indicate that the core formation of this protein follows a pathway that is energetically downhill. The unfolding rates are much more strongly temperature-dependent indicating an activated process with a large energy barrier. These results provide significant insight into the primary process of protein folding and suggest that fast formation of helices can drive the folding of helical proteins.",

The results show that W140 is critical to SNase structure, stability, and function.

To gain insight into the basis of thermostability, we have determined protein stability curves describing the temperature dependence of the free energy of unfolding for two ribonucleases H, one from the mesophile Escherichia coli and one from the thermophile Thermus thermophilus. The circular dichroism signal was monitored as a function of temperature and guanidinium chloride concentration, and the resulting free energies of unfolding were fit to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to obtain a set of thermodynamic parameters for these proteins. Although the maximal stabilities for these proteins occur at similar temperatures, the heat capacity of unfolding for T. thermophilus RNase H is lower, resulting in a smaller temperature dependence of the free energy of unfolding and therefore a higher thermal melting temperature. In addition, the stabilities of these proteins are similar at the optimal growth temperatures for their respective organisms, suggesting that a balance of thermodynamic stability and flexibility is important for function.",

The apoA-I deletion delta(144-165) leads to a red shift in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence and a reduction in the alpha-helical content, the stability, the initial rate of association with DMPC liposomes, and the size of the discoidal particles. The data are consistent with the helical structure of residues 144-165, and the deletion appears to perturb the tertiary organization of the N-terminal half of apoA-I. In contrast, the deletion of the adjacent region, delta(136-143), leads to stabilization without altering the number of residues in the helical conformation or the initial rate of association with DMPC liposomes. The quadruple substitution E125K/E128K/K133E/E139K leads to approximately 17 additional residues in the helical conformation and an increase in the stability, the initial rate of association with DMPC liposomes, and the size of the rHDL particles. The findings are consistent with the disordered structure of the segment of residues 123-142, which becomes helical as a result of the quadruple mutation or upon lipid binding. The naturally occurring mutation L141R (also associated with coronary heart disease) that is located in this segment does not change the protein conformation but leads to a reduced stability and a decreased rate of association with DMPC liposomes that may relate to the observed altered functions of this mutant.",

        "abstract": "The slow folding of circularly permuted variants of ribonuclease T1 has been examined using steady-state and frequency-domain fluorescence spectroscopy. The sequence transpositions have previously been designed by eliminating a restrictive Cys2-Cys10 disulfide bond, adjoining the original termini with a three-peptide Gly-Gly-Gly linker, and conferring new termini to four different solvent-exposed beta-turns interposing secondary structural elements [Garrett, J. B., Mullins, L. S., & Raushel, F. M. (1996) Protein Sci. 5, 204-211]. Each of the mutant proteins continues to be rate-limited in folding by the slow trans to cis isomerizations of Pro39 and Pro55, giving rise to a branched mechanism populated by intermediates with mixed proline isomers. However, the overall rate of folding is increased in accordance with the general destabilizing effect of each circular permutation. Steric hindrances imposed by Trp59 on the isomerization around the Tyr38-Pro39 peptide bond have been implicated in decelerating the folding of RNase T1 [Kiefhaber, T., Grunert, H.-P., Hahn, U., & Schmid, F. X. (1992) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 12, 171-179]; it is this tertiary restraint which appears to be variably relieved by the sequence transpositions. A fluorescence characterization of Trp59 indicates little difference between fully folded RNase T1 and the variants in terms of its lifetime, accessibility to quenchers, and rotational properties. Yet, within protein that is \"completely\" denatured, Trp59 exhibits variable flexibility, greatest within the circularly permuted variants folding the fastest. Such differences in the dynamic properties of Trp59 between each denatured protein may be direct evidence for a relative loosening of the tertiary fold maintaining the \"deleterious\" Trp59-Pro39 interaction in the partially folded intermediates.",

Sedimentation equilibrium analysis in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 5.7, shows (i) the strong and weak self-association of the N- and C-fragments, respectively, (ii) a heterodimer with a small dissociation constant (K(d)) ca. 100 nM, and (iii) monomeric Trx. To avoid self-association, measurements were carried out in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 5.7. Far-UV CD spectra of the fragments at variable temperature show an isodichroic point at 208 nm and a non-cooperative cold induced disordering transition without concentration dependence. Deconvolution of these spectra indicates the presence of residual structure. Titration of the N-fragment with an excess of C-fragment indicates a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with an apparent K(d) ca. 49 nM. Analysis of this complex by CD and hydrogen exchange/2D-NMR (Tasayco and Chao (1995) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 22, 41-44) spectroscopy indicates the reassembly of the alpha/beta motif of Trx. GnHCl induced unfolding measurements give DeltaG(0) values of 9.5 +/- 0.2 and 10.0 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol at 20 degrees C for the uncleaved and cleaved Trx, respectively. The far-UV CD melting curve of uncleaved Trx indicates an intriguing non-cooperative upward baseline trend. CCA analysis of these spectra indicates the presence of a native-like folded intermediate. A three-state thermodynamic analysis of the thermal transition curves gives a total DeltaH(0) of unfolding of 121 +/- 4 kcal/mol at the T(m) (88 degrees C), while the two-state analysis for cleaved Trx gives 122 +/- 6 kcal/mol at 88 degrees C.

        "abstract": "The urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase (alphaTS) from Escherichia coli can be described by a four-state model, N right harpoon over left harpoon I1 right harpoon over left harpoon I2 right harpoon over left harpoon U, involving two highly populated intermediates, I1 and I2 [Gualfetti, P. J., Bilsel, O., and Matthews, C. R. (1999) Protein Sci. 8, 1623-1635]. To extend the physical characterization of these stable forms, the apparent radius was measured by several techniques. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), analytical ultracentrifugation (UC), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments yield an apparent Stokes radius, R(s), of approximately 24 A for the native state of alphaTS. The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiment yields a radius of gyration, R(g), of 19.1 A, consistent with the value predicted from the X-ray structure and the Stokes radius. As the equilibrium is shifted to favor I1 at approximately 3.2 M and I2 at 5.0 M urea, SEC and UC show that R(s) increases from approximately 38 to approximately 52 A. Measurements of the radius by DLS and SAXS between 2 and 4.5 M urea were complicated by the self-association of the I1 species at the relatively high concentrations required by those techniques. Above 6 M urea, SEC and UC reveal that R(s) increases linearly with increasing urea concentration to approximately 54 A at 8 M urea. The measurements of R(s) by DLS and R(g) by SAXS are sufficiently imprecise that both values appear to be identical for the I2 and U states and, considering the errors, are in good agreement with the results from SEC and UC. Thermodynamic parameters extracted from the SEC data for the N right harpoon over left harpoon I1 and I1 right harpoon over left harpoon I2 transitions agree with those from the optical data, showing that this technique accurately monitors a part of the equilibrium model. The lack of sensitivity to the I2 right harpoon over left harpoon U transition, beyond a simple swelling of both species with increasing urea concentration, implies that the Stokes radii for the I2 and U states are not distinguishable. Surprisingly, the hydrophobic core known to stabilize I2 at 5.0 M urea [Saab-Rinc\u00f3n, G., Gualfetti, P. J., and Matthews, C. R. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 1988-1994] develops without a significant contraction of the polypeptide, i.e., beyond that experienced by the unfolded form at decreasing urea concentrations. Kratky plots of the SAXS data, however, reveal that I2, similar to N and I1, has a globular structure while U has a more random coil-like form. By contrast, the formation of substantial secondary structure and the burial of aromatic side chains in I1 and, eventually, N are accompanied by substantial decreases in their Stokes radii and, presumably, the size of their respective conformational ensembles.",

The stability was measured as a function of pH for wild-type RNase T1 and the D76N mutant and showed that the pH dependence below pH 3 was almost entirely due to Asp 76. The pK of Asp 76 is 0.5 in the native state and 3.7 in the denatured state. Thus, the hydrogen bonding of the carboxyl group of Asp 76 contributes more than half of the net stability of RNase T1 at pH 7.

        "abstract": "Guanidinium chloride is a commonly used denaturant to unfold native proteins and to determine their Gibbs free energy of stabilization, delta Gstab. Here we show that this denaturant has a dual role for the stability and the folding of the model protein ribonuclease T1. When present at low concentration (0-0.3 M), guanidinium chloride stabilizes the folded protein toward thermal and urea-induced unfolding and decreases the rate of unfolding. At high concentration the function of guanidinium chloride as a denaturant dominates and ribonuclease T1 is cooperatively unfolded. Ribonuclease T1 is also strongly stabilized by other salts, such as NaCl, at low concentrations, and the dependence of the thermal stability on salt concentration is not linear. Such a complex behavior was not found in control experiments with pancreatic ribonuclease A. The stabilization in the presence of low concentrations of guanidinium chloride originates probably from the binding of guanidinium ions to one or a few cation binding sites that exist in native ribonuclease T1. It is not observed when an additional salt, NaCl, is present simultaneously. The favorable interaction of guanidinium chloride with the native protein leads to increased values for delta Gstab, when unfolding transitions induced by guanidinium chloride are analyzed on the basis of the two-state model by the linear extrapolation procedure. The noncoincidence of these delta Gstab values with stability data derived from urea-induced or thermal unfolding transitions does not imply that the two-state model is not appropriate but that the linear extrapolation to zero molar denaturant is incorrect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that the Cys74-Cys84 bond is essential for full biological and receptor binding activities. To address the structural importance of these disulfide bonds in the formation and stabilization of IL-6 secondary and tertiary structures, we have generated a panel of disulfide bond-deficient rIL-6 analogs both by chemical reduction and alkylation as well as by site-directed mutagenesis. Conformational changes affecting these rIL-6 analogs were probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, as well as reactivity with monoclonal antibodies, and correlated with changes in biological activities. We have shown that the first disulfide bridge (Cys45-Cys51) is highly sensitive to reduction and, therefore, more solvent-exposed or less thermodynamically stable. Contrary to previous reports, this bridge contributes, although minimally, to the full biological activity of the cytokine. However, no significant changes in secondary or tertiary structures were observed upon removal of this bond. In marked contrast, analogs lacking the disulfide bridge between Cys74 and Cys84 exhibited as little as 0.5% and 0.05% wild-type biological and receptor binding activities, respectively. These dramatic changes correlated with a slight reduction in alpha-helical content and a decreased reactivity with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody mAb8 which recognizes a conformational epitope associated with the active site. Our results suggest that the second disulfide bridge plays a critical role in maintaining the spatial relationship between the putative IL-6 A and D helices.",

In individual cases, ligands have been used to increase the success rate of protein purification and crystallization, but the broad applicability of this approach is unknown. We implemented two screening platforms, based on either fluorimetry or static light scattering, to measure the increase in protein thermal stability upon binding of a ligand without the need to monitor enzyme activity. In total, 221 different proteins from humans and human parasites were screened against one or both of two sorts of small-molecule libraries. The first library comprised different salts, pH conditions, and commonly found small molecules and was applicable to all proteins. The second comprised compounds specific for protein families of particular interest (e.g., protein kinases). In 20 cases, including nine unique human protein kinases, a small molecule was identified that stabilized the proteins and promoted structure determination. The methods are cost-effective, can be implemented in any laboratory, promise to increase the success rates of purifying and crystallizing human proteins significantly, and identify new ligands for these proteins.",

In this work, which continues the previous investigations, we report on a DSC study of the complexes of S1 with various nucleoside diphosphates (NDP). In the absence of Vi or BeFx the various Mg(2+)-NDP and Mg(2+)-PPi had a similar effect on the S1 conformation. All of them had practically no influence on the temperature of the thermal transition but increased its sharpness. However, in the presence of Vi or BeFx the effects of Mg(2+)-NDP complexes were quite different from each other and strongly depended on the base structure of NDP; their effectiveness in inducing conformational changes in S1 and the stability of these complexes decreased in the following order: ADP > CDP > UDP > IDP > GDP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that a fraction of the information contained in an amino acid sequence may be sufficient for specifying a native protein structure. An earlier alanine-scanning experiment conducted on bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI; 58 residues) suggested that if cumulative mutations have additive effects on protein stability, a native protein structure could be built from BPTI sequences that contained many alanine residues distributed throughout the protein. To test this hypothesis, we designed and produced six BPTI mutants containing from 21 to 29 alanine residues. We found that the melting temperature of mutants containing up to 27 alanine residues (48 % of the total number of residues) could be predicted quite well by the sum of the change in melting temperature for the single mutations. Additionally, these same mutants folded into a native-like structure, as judged by their cooperative thermal denaturation curves and heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) NMR spectra. A BPTI mutant containing 22 alanine residues was further shown by 2D and 3D-NMR to fold into a structure very similar to that of native BPTI, and to be a functional trypsin inhibitor. These results provide insight into the extent to which native protein structure and function can be achieved with a highly simplified amino acid sequence.",

        "abstract": "The core domain of the tumour suppressor p53 is of inherently low thermodynamic stability and also low kinetic stability, which leads to rapid irreversible denaturation. Some oncogenic mutations of p53 act by just making the core domain thermosensitive, and so it is the target of novel anti-cancer drugs that bind to and stabilise the protein. Increasing the stability of the unstable core domain has also been crucial for biophysical and structural studies, in which a stabilised quadruple mutant (QM) is currently used. We generated an even more stabilised hexamutant (HM) by making two additional substitutions, Y236F and T253I, to the QM. The residues are found in the more stable paralogs p63 and p73 and stabilise the wild-type p53 core domain. We solved the structure of the HM core domain by X-ray crystallography at 1.75 A resolution. It has minimal structural changes from QM that affect the packing of hydrophobic core residues of the beta-sandwich. The full-length HM was also fully functional in DNA binding. HM was more stable than QM at 37 degrees C. Anomalies in biophysics and spectroscopy in urea-mediated denaturation curves of HM implied the accumulation of a folding intermediate, which may be related to those detected in kinetic experiments. The two additional mutations over-stabilise an unfolding intermediate. These results should be taken into consideration in drug design strategies for increasing the stability of temperature-sensitive mutants of p53.",

        "abstract": "Previous X-ray crystal structures have shown that linkers of five amino acid residues connecting pairs of chicken brain alpha-spectrin and human erythroid beta-spectrin repeats can undergo bending without losing their alpha-helical structure. To test whether bending at one linker can influence bending at an adjacent linker, the structures of two and three repeat fragments of chicken brain alpha-spectrin have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The structure of the three-repeat fragment clearly shows that bending at one linker can occur independently of bending at an adjacent linker. This observation increases the possible trajectories of modeled chains of spectrin repeats. Furthermore, the three-repeat molecule crystallized as an antiparallel dimer with a significantly smaller buried interfacial area than that of alpha-actinin, a spectrin-related molecule, but large enough and of a type indicating biological specificity. Comparison of the structures of the spectrin and alpha-actinin dimers supports weak association of the former, which could not be detected by analytical ultracentrifugation, versus strong association of the latter, which has been observed by others. To correlate features of the structure with solution properties and to test a previous model of stable spectrin and dystrophin repeats, the number of inter-helical interactions in each repeat of several spectrin structures were counted and compared to their thermal stabilities. Inter-helical interactions, but not all interactions, increased in parallel with measured thermal stabilities of each repeat and in agreement with the thermal stabilities of two and three repeats and also partial repeats of spectrin.",

        "abstract": "Is the pathway of protein folding determined by the relative stability of folding intermediates, or by the relative height of the activation barriers leading to these intermediates? This is a fundamental question for resolving the Levinthal paradox, which stated that protein folding by a random search mechanism would require a time too long to be plausible. To answer this question, we have studied the guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced folding/unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease [(SNase, formerly EC 3.1.4.7; now called microbial nuclease or endonuclease, EC 3.1.31.1] by stopped-flow circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC). The data show that while the equilibrium transition is a quasi-two-state process, kinetics in the 2-ms to 500-s time range are triphasic. Data support the sequential mechanism for SNase folding: U3 <--> U2 <--> U1 <--> N0, where U1, U2, and U3 are substates of the unfolded protein and N0 is the native state. Analysis of the relative population of the U1, U2, and U3 species in 2.0 M GdmCl gives delta-G values for the U3 --> U2 reaction of +0.1 kcal/mol and for the U2 --> U1 reaction of -0.49 kcal/mol. The delta-G value for the U1 --> N0 reaction is calculated to be -4.5 kcal/mol from DSC data. The activation energy, enthalpy, and entropy for each kinetic step are also determined. These results allow us to make the following four conclusions. (i) Although the U1, U2, and U3 states are nearly isoenergetic, no random walk occurs among them during the folding. The pathway of folding is unique and sequential. In other words, the relative stability of the folding intermediates does not dictate the folding pathway. Instead, the folding is a descent toward the global free-energy minimum of the native state via the least activation path in the vast energy landscape. Barrier avoidance leads the way, and barrier height limits the rate. Thus, the Levinthal paradox is not applicable to the protein-folding problem. (ii) The main folding reaction (U1 --> N0), in which the peptide chain acquires most of its free energy (via van der Waals' contacts, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions), is a highly concerted process. These energy-acquiring events take place in a single kinetic phase. (iii) U1 appears to be a compact unfolded species; the rate of conversion of U2 to U1 depends on the viscosity of solution. (iv) All four relaxation times reported here depend on GdmCl concentrations: it is likely that none involve the cis/trans isomerization of prolines. Finally, a mechanism is presented in which formation of sheet-like chain conformations and a hydrophobic condensation event precede the main-chain folding reaction.",

Their thermodynamic parameters of denaturation and crystal structures were examined by calorimetry and by x-ray crystallography at 100 K, respectively. The introduced polar residues made hydrogen bonds with protein atoms and/or water molecules, sometimes changing the hydration structure around the mutation site. Changes in the stability of the mutant proteins can be evaluated by a unique equation that considers the conformational changes resulting from the substitutions. Using this analysis, the relationship between the changes in the stabilities and the hydration structures for mutant human lysozymes substituted on the surface could be quantitatively estimated.

Wild-type coat protein subunits denatured at 40 degrees C, with a calorimetric enthalpy of approximately 600 kJ/mol. Comparison with coat protein denaturation within the shell lattice (Tm = 87 degrees C, delta H approximately 1700 kJ/mol) (Galisteo, M.L., and King, J. (1993) Biophys. J. 65, 227-235) indicates that protein-protein interactions within the capsid provide enormous stabilization. The melting temperatures of the subunits carrying tsf substitutions were similar to wild-type. At low temperatures, the tsf mutants, but not the wild-type, formed non-covalent dimers, which were dissociated at temperatures above 30 degrees C. Spectroscopic and calorimetric studies indicated that the mutant proteins have reduced amounts of ordered structure at low temperature, as compared to the wild-type protein. Although complex, the in vitro phenotypes are consistent with the in vivo finding that the mutants are defective in folding, rather than subunit stability. These results suggest a role for incompletely folded subunits as precursors in viral capsid assembly, providing a mechanism of reaching multiple conformations in the polymerized form.",

Cys-191, which is conserved in all AATase isozymes, was mutated to serine as well (C191S). A quintuple mutant, with all cysteines converted to alanines (Quint), was also constructed. The effects of these single and multiple mutations were examined by steady-state kinetics and urea denaturation. The thermal stabilities of Quint and of the wild-type enzyme (WT) were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The mutants had kcat values up to 50% greater than that of WT and KMAsp and KM alpha-KG values up to 1.5- and 3.3-fold higher than that of WT. The mutants C82A and C191A exhibit nearly the same CM in urea denaturation experiments as WT, while the other single mutants and Quint are less stable, with CM differences of up to 0.7 M urea. Quint is also less thermostable than WT, with a delta TM of 3.3-4.4 degrees C. Thus the five cysteine replacements yield small, but significant, changes in catalytic and denaturation parameters, but none of the cysteines was found to be essential. The changes manifested in the mutation of the conserved Cys-191 to alanine are no greater than those observed with the four nonconserved cysteines.

        "abstract": "Conformational stability of the membrane-binding protein annexin V E17G has been determined by high-sensitivity differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) measurements and by isothermal, guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding studies. Wild-type annexin V and the E17G mutant protein studied here are structurally almost identical. Therefore, it can be expected that the present results will not deviate significantly from the stability data of the wild-type molecule. Thermal unfolding is irreversible, while GdnHCl unfolding shows a high degree of reversibility. We were able to demonstrate that characteristic features of annexin V E17G unfolding permit us to extract from the kinetically controlled heat capacity curves thermodynamic equilibrium parameters at the high heating rates. The thermodynamic quantities obtained from the DSC studies in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 are as follows: t1/2 = 54.7 degrees C (heating rate of 2.34 K min-1), delta H0 = 690 kJ mol-1, and delta Cp = 10.3 kJ mol-1 K-1 which correspondends to a value of delta G0D (20 degrees C) of 53.4 kJ mol-1. When compared on a per gram basis, these thermodynamic parameters classify annexin V E17G as a marginally stable protein. This conclusion is consistent with structural and functional features of the protein that require conformational adaptability for hinge-bending motions and pore formation on interaction with membranes. We observed a large difference between the change in the Gibbs energy value derived from the heat capacity studies and that determined from the GdnHCl unfolding curve. The difference appears to stem from a specific interaction of the protein with the denaturant that results in both a low half-denaturation concentration C1/2 of 1.74 M and a small slope (6.0 kJ L mol-2) of the delta Gapp versus [GdnHCl] plot. The extraordinary interaction of annexin V with GdnHCl is also manifested in the enormous depression of the transition temperature delta t1/2 (= 18 degrees C) when the GdnHCl concentration is increased from 0 to 1 M. \"Regular\" proteins experience an average decrease in the transition temperature of 8 +/- 2 degrees C per 1 M change in the concentration of GdnHCl.",

The unfolding was probed by three spectroscopic parameters: absorbance at 235 nm, Trp fluorescence intensity at 320 nm, and far-UV circular dichroism at 223 nm. Global analysis indicated that a three-state model better describes the unfolding behavior than a two-state model, an indication that there are stable intermediates for both alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins. In terms of standard free energy (DeltaG(NU)(H(2)(O))), alphaA-crystallin is slightly more stable than alphaB-crystallin.

In general, polar residues in the core are thermodynamically unfavorable except when they are able to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Compared to hydrophobic interactions, polar interactions are more directional in character and may aid in fold specificity. In a survey of 263 globular protein structures, we found a strong positive correlation between the number of polar residues at core positions and protein size. To probe the importance of buried polar residues, we experimentally tested the effects of hydrophobic mutations at the five polar core residues in Escherichia coli thioredoxin. Proteins with single hydrophobic mutations (D26I, C32A, C35A, T66L, and T77V) all have cooperative unfolding transitions like the wild type (wt), as determined by chemical denaturation. Relative to wt, D26I is more stable while the other point mutants are less stable. The combined 5-fold mutant protein (IAALV) is less stable than wt and has an unfolding transition that is substantially less cooperative than that of wt. NMR spectra as well as amide deuterium exchange indicate that IAALV is likely sampling a number of low-energy structures in the folded state, suggesting that polar residues in the core are important for specifying a well-folded native structure.",

        "abstract": "Protein S from Myxococcus xanthus is a member of the beta gamma-crystallin superfamily. Its N and C-terminal domains (NPS and CPS, respectively) show a high degree of structural similarity and possess the capacity to bind two calcium ions per domain. For NPS, their positions were determined by X-ray diffraction at 1.8 A resolution, making use of molecular replacement with the NMR structure as search model. The overall topology of NPS is found to be practically the same as in complete protein S. In natural protein S, the domains fold independently, with a significant increase in stability and cooperativity of folding in the presence of Ca2+. The recombinant isolated domains are stable monomers which do not show any tendency to combine to \"nicked\" full-length protein S. In order to investigate the stability and folding of natural protein S and its isolated domains, spectroscopic techniques were applied, measuring the reversible urea and temperature-induced unfolding transitions at varying pH. The increment of Ca2+ to the free energy of stabilization amounts to -10 and -5 kJ/mol for NPS and CPS, respectively. For both NPS and CPS, in the absence and in the presence of 3 mM CaCl2, the two-state model is valid. Comparing DeltaGU-->N for CPS (-21 kJ/mol at pH 7, liganded with Ca2+) with its increment in the intact two-domain protein, the stability of the isolated domain turns out to be decreased in a pH-dependent manner. In contrast, the stability of Ca2+-loaded NPS (DeltaGU-->N=-31 kJ/mol, pH 7) is nearly unchanged down to pH 2 where Ca2+ is released (DeltaGU-->N=-26 kJ/mol, pH 2). In intact protein S, the N-terminal domain is destabilized relative to NPS. Evidently, apart from Ca2+ binding, well-defined domain interactions contribute significantly to the overall stability of intact protein S.",

        "abstract": "The urea-induced unfolding reaction of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase was monitored by examining the chemical shifts and peak areas of the C epsilon protons of the four histidine residues with 1D NMR spectroscopy. In a native base-line region defined by tyrosine absorbance and far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, histidine-146 appears to undergo a rapid, local unfolding reaction at increasing denaturant concentrations. As the native form is converted to a previously detected stable intermediate between 2 and 3 M urea [Matthews, C. R., & Crisanti, M. M. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 784], histidines-92 and -146 in the amino folding unit (residues 1-188) and histidines-195 and -244 in the carboxy folding unit (residues 189-268) all experience a change in their environments which is slow on the NMR time scale. The subsequent conversion of this intermediate to a newly detected, stable, partially folded form populated at 5 M urea appears to have no effect on any of the histidines at 25 degrees C when an intermolecular association process involving His-244 is taken into account. Strikingly, a slow exchange process involving only His-92 is observed to begin at 5 M urea where the unfolding transitions monitored by absorbance or far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy are essentially complete. This residual tertiary structure unfolds in a cooperative fashion as the urea concentration is increased to 8 M.",

We have repacked the hydrophobic core of the four-helix-bundle protein, Rop, with altered packing patterns and various side chain shapes and sizes. Several designs reproduce the structure and native-like properties of the wild-type, while increasing the thermal stability. Other designs, either with similar sizes but different shapes, or with decreased sizes of the packing residues, destabilize the protein. Finally, overpacking the core with the larger side chains causes a loss of native-like structure. These results allow us to further define the roles of tight residue packing and the burial of hydrophobic surface area in the construction of native-like proteins.",

        "abstract": "Reversible chemical modifications of a series of single cysteine-containing variants of T4 lysozyme combined with thermal denaturation studies have been used to study the effects of these modifications on the stability of the protein. This allows dissection of the energetic effects of the modification on both the native and denatured states of this protein. At some sites modifications with various chemical reagents have essentially no effect on the stability of the protein, while at others, substantial changes in stability are observed. For example, chemical modification of cysteine at site 146 by cystamine (+NH3CH2CH2SSCH2-CH2NH3+) to form the mixed disulfide lowers the stability of the protein by about 1.1 kcal/mol. The reduction in the free energy of folding caused by the chemical modification is attributed to the destabilization of native state (0.9 kcal/mol), with only a relatively small effect from stabilization of the denatured state (0.2 kcal/mol). Chemical modifications of T4 lysozyme at site 146 with various chemical reagents show that the stability of the protein is lowered by a positively charged group and is relatively independent of the size of the side chains. This approach allows the investigation of the thermodynamic consequences of the reversible insertion of a wide variety of chemical entities at specific sites in proteins and, most importantly, allows dissection of the contribution of the chemical modifications to both the folded and unfolding states. It can be applied to almost any suitable macromolecular system.",

        "abstract": "The structure of AcP from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus has been determined by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Solution and crystal structures (1.27 A resolution, R-factor 13.7%) were obtained on the full-length protein and on an N-truncated form lacking the first 12 residues, respectively. The overall Sso AcP fold, starting at residue 13, displays the same betaalphabetabetaalphabeta topology previously described for other members of the AcP family from mesophilic sources. The unstructured N-terminal tail may be crucial for the unusual aggregation mechanism of Sso AcP previously reported. Sso AcP catalytic activity is reduced at room temperature but rises at its working temperature to values comparable to those displayed by its mesophilic counterparts at 25-37 degrees C. Such a reduced activity can result from protein rigidity and from the active site stiffening due the presence of a salt bridge between the C-terminal carboxylate and the active site arginine. Sso AcP is characterized by a melting temperature, Tm, of 100.8 degrees C and an unfolding free energy, DeltaG(U-F)H2O, at 28 degrees C and 81 degrees C of 48.7 and 20.6 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The kinetic and structural data indicate that mesophilic and hyperthermophilic AcP's display similar enzymatic activities and conformational stabilities at their working conditions. Structural analysis of the factor responsible for Sso AcP thermostability with respect to mesophilic AcP's revealed the importance of a ion pair network stabilizing particularly the beta-sheet and the loop connecting the fourth and fifth strands, together with increased density packing, loop shortening and a higher alpha-helical propensity.",

        "abstract": "RNA binding domains (RBDs) are members of a large family of proteins that share minimal sequence conservation but adopt an alpha beta sandwich global fold. Defining the contributions of specific amino acids to RBD structure and RNA binding is critical to understanding the functions of these proteins. In these experiments with the human U1A N-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD1), the contributions from each of its four tyrosines to protein structure, stability, and RNA binding were measured. Each tyrosine was substituted with phenylalanine and one other selected residue, and the resulting proteins were characterized by chemical denaturation to measure their unfolding free energy, by binding free energies to the wild-type RNA hairpin, and by 19F NMR to probe for structural changes. Features of the protein identified in these experiments include a possible tyrosine/lysine contact in an alpha-helix, which may be an example of an energetically favorable aromatic/amino side chain interaction. One long loop of the protein, which shows unusual 15N backbone and tyrosine side-chain dynamics, is implicated in protein:protein association. The diverse interactions of the four tyrosine residues in the organization of RBD1 illustrate how each member of this family of proteins will have unique molecular details that contribute to function.",

        "abstract": "Human gammaD crystallin (HgammaD-Crys), a major protein of the human eye lens, is a primary component of cataracts. This 174-residue primarily beta-sheet protein is made up of four Greek keys separated into two domains. Mutations in the human gene sequence encoding HgammaD-Crys are implicated in early-onset cataracts in children, and the mutant protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibits properties that reflect the in vivo pathology. We have characterized the unfolding, refolding, and competing aggregation of human wild-type HgammaD-Crys as a function of guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl) concentration at neutral pH and 37 degrees C, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to monitor in vitro folding. Wild-type HgammaD-Crys exhibited reversible refolding above 1.0 M GuHCl. The GuHCl unfolded protein was more fluorescent than its native counterpart despite the absence of metal or ion-tryptophan interactions. Aggregation of refolding intermediates of HgammaD-Crys was observed in both equilibrium and kinetic refolding processes. The aggregation pathway competed with productive refolding at denaturant concentrations below 1.0 M GuHCl, beyond the major conformational transition region. Atomic force microscopy of samples under aggregating conditions revealed the sequential appearance of small nuclei, thin protofibrils, and fiber bundles. The HgammaD-Crys fibrous aggregate species bound bisANS appreciably, indicating the presence of exposed hydrophobic pockets. The mechanism of HgammaD-Crys aggregation may provide clues to understanding age-onset cataract formation in vivo.",

        "abstract": "The role of the threonine 101 residue that resides close to the heme propionic acid side chain of cytochrome P450cam on the conformational properties of the active site of the enzyme has been investigated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Site-specific mutation of the threonine by valine has been carried out that does not affect the size of the residue but significantly alters the hydropathy index. The T101V mutant of cytochrome P450cam showed distinct differences in the CD spectra near the heme region, indicating a subtle effect of the mutation on the properties of the heme active site. Thermal stabilities of the mutant and wild-type enzyme have been studied by temperature dependence of the ellipticity (intensity of the CD band) in the far-UV region for the secondary structure and at different wavelengths in the visible region that arise from the heme moiety for the tertiary structure around the prosthetic group. The thermal unfolding data from variations of the CD intensity at different wavelengths were analyzed using a generalized multistep unfolding model, and two distinct equilibrium intermediate conformational states of the enzyme were identified. The mutation of the T101 residue by valine was found to decrease the thermal stability of both the intermediates in the presence of the substrate. On the other hand, this mutation had no apparent effect on the thermal stability of the enzyme in the absence of the substrate. These results suggested that the threonine residue stabilizes the protein cavity around the heme center in the case of the substrate-bound species, possibly by hydrogen bonding with one of the propionate side chains of the heme moiety. Such hydrogen bonding of the heme propionate with threonine is absent in the substrate-free form of the enzyme.",

        "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) contains four internal water molecules, which form a total of nine intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the BPTI polypeptide chain. To investigate the effect of such internal hydration on protein structure and stability, we displaced one of the internal water molecules in a recombinant BPTI analogue, BPTI(G36S), in which Gly 36 is replaced by serine. The replacement of a water molecule by the seryl side chain was established by the absence of the protein-water nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) that had been attributed to the water molecule near Gly 36 in wild-type BPTI and by the presence of new, intramolecular NOEs to the hydroxyl proton of Ser 36. BPTI(G36S) has slightly reduced thermal stability compared to BPTI, corresponding to a destabilization by delta (delta G) approximately 0.7 kcal/M in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride solution. Additionally, the stabilities of the complexes formed between BPTI(G36S) and trypsin, plasmin, or kallikrein are significantly reduced when compared to the corresponding complexes with wild-type BPTI.",

        "abstract": "Coiled coils are simple models for studying the association of two polypeptide chains to form a folded protein. Previous work has shown that the folding of a coiled coil can be described by a two-state transition between two unfolded monomeric peptide chains and a folded coiled coil dimer. Here we report the thermodynamic activation parameters for the folding and unfolding of two unrelated coiled coils: C62GCN4 and A(2). C62GCN4 corresponds to the 62 C-terminal residues of yeast transcription factor GCN4. The peptide forms a dimeric coiled coil through its 33 C-terminal residues. A(2) is a designed 30-residue dimeric coiled coil whose folding is induced by low pH [D\u00fcrr, E., Jelesarov, I., and Bosshard, H. R. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 870-880]. Folding and unfolding were assessed under identical native buffer conditions so that the microscopic reversibility applied and the transition state was the same for folding and unfolding. The time course of folding was followed from the self-quenching of a C-terminal fluorescent label (Texas Red). The overall folding of both peptides is enthalpy-driven and opposed by a loss of entropy. The main energetic changes occur after the system has passed the transition state. In the folding of C62GCN4, only 10-20% of the heat capacity change is attained between the monomeric state and the dimeric transition state. For coiled coil A(2), the fractional heat capacity change preceding the transition state is 30-40%. The results indicate that the activated states of folding of coiled coils are not well structured and differ considerably from the folded coiled coil conformation. These findings are in agreement with a rate-limiting transition state in which the coiled coil helices and the hydrophobic coiled coil interface are poorly developed.",

The substitutions decreased the stability of the protein at pH 3.0 by different amounts, ranging from 2.7 kilocalories per mole (kcal mol-1) for L46A and L121A to 5.0 kcal mol-1 for L99A. The double mutant L99A/F153A was also constructed and decreased in stability by 8.3 kcal mol-1. The x-ray structures of all of the variants were determined at high resolution. In every case, removal of the wild-type side chain allowed some of the surrounding atoms to move toward the vacated space but a cavity always remained, which ranged in volume from 24 cubic angstroms (A3) for L46A to 150 A3 for L99A. No solvent molecules were observed in any of these cavities. The destabilization of the mutant Leu----Ala proteins relative to wild type can be approximated by a constant term (approximately 2.0 kcal mol-1) plus a term that increases in proportion to the size of the cavity. The constant term is approximately equal to the transfer free energy of leucine relative to alanine as determined from partitioning between aqueous and organic solvents. The energy term that increases with the size of the cavity can be expressed either in terms of the cavity volume (24 to 33 cal mol-1 A-3) or in terms of the cavity surface area (20 cal mol-1 A-2).

        "abstract": "Spectroscopic studies have been performed to characterize the solution structure of the V66W mutant of Staphylococcal nuclease and the corresponding 1-136 fragment, referred to as V66W'. Whereas wild-type nuclease has a single tryptophan residue at position 140, the V66W mutant has a second tryptophan residue at position 66, which is the only such residue in V66W'. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence studies show Trp-66 in V66W' to have a blue emission, a relatively large fluorescence quantum yield, a long lifetime, a significant degree of protection from solute quenchers, and to depolarize with a relatively long rotational correlation time. These results characterize Trp-66 in V66W' as being a buried residue, which indicates that this fragment retains some global structure. Circular dichroism (CD) data are consistent with the fragment having lost most of the alpha-helical content of the wild type, while retaining beta-sheet structure. The CD spectrum in the aromatic region also suggests that Trp-66 in the fragment experiences an asymmetric environment, which is not identical to that in the full length mutant, V66W. In addition, optical detection of triplet state magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy can clearly resolve the tryptophan residues and demonstrates differences between the local environment of Trp-66 in V66W and in V66W', as well as small differences in the Trp-140 environment in wild type and in V66W. Guanidine-HCl induced and thermally induced unfolding studies were performed by simultaneously acquiring CD and fluorescence data as a function of the perturbation and then performing a global analysis of such multiple data sets in terms of two-state and three-state unfolding models. Whereas data for wild-type nuclease and the V66W' fragment are well characterized by a two-state unfolding model, data for the V66W mutant are better characterized by a three-state process. That is, both the denaturant- and temperature-induced unfolding of V66W involves the significant population of an equilibrium unfolding intermediate. Our global analyses yield thermodynamic parameters for the unfolding transitions, and we show that the data for V66W can be described by a constrained three-state model in which the transition of the intermediate to the fully unfolded state is fixed to have the same thermodynamic parameters that describe the unfolding of the V66W' fragment.",

Although the biochemical function and pathogenic mechanism of CBP are unknown, quantitative Ca (2+) binding measurements indicate that CBP has a strong affinity for calcium ( K D = 6.45 +/- 0.4 nM). However, no change in structure was observed upon binding of calcium, prompting a more thorough investigation of the molecular properties of CBP with respect to self-association, secondary structure, and stability. Over a wide range of pH values and salt concentrations, CBP exists predominantly as a stable, noncovalent homodimer in both its calcium-free and -bound states. Solution-state NMR and circular dichroism (CD) measurements indicated that the protein is largely alpha-helical, and its secondary structure content changes little over the range of pH values encountered physiologically. ESI-MS revealed that the six cysteine residues of CBP are involved in three intramolecular disulfide bonds that help maintain a highly protease resistant structure. Thermally and chemically induced denaturation studies indicated that unfolding of disulfide-intact CBP is reversible and provided quantitative measurements of protein stability. This disulfide-linked, protease resistant, homodimeric alpha-helical structure of CBP is likely to be advantageous for a virulence factor that must survive the harsh environment within the phagolysosomes of host macrophages.",

        "abstract": "LytA amidase is the best known bacterial autolysin. It breaks down the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine bonds in the peptidoglycan backbone of Streptococcus pneumoniae and requires the presence of choline residues in the cell-wall teichoic acids for activity. Genetic experiments have supported the hypothesis that its 36-kDa chain has evolved by the fusion of two independent modules: the NH2-terminal module, responsible for the catalytic activity, and the COOH-terminal module, involved in the attachment to the cell wall. The structural organization of LytA amidase and of its isolated COOH-terminal module (C-LytA) and the variations induced by choline binding have been examined by differential scanning calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation. Deconvolution of calorimetric curves have revealed a folding of the polypeptide chain in several independent or quasi-independent cooperative domains. Elementary transitions in C-LytA are close but not identical to those assigned to the COOH-terminal module in the complete amidase, particularly in the absence of choline. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal region of the protein is important for attaining the native tertiary fold of the COOH terminus. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies have shown that LytA exhibits a monomer <--> dimer association equilibrium, through the COOH-terminal part of the molecule. Dimerization is regulated by choline interaction and involves the preferential binding of two molecules of choline per dimer. Sedimentation velocity experiments give frictional ratios of 1.1 for C-LytA monomer and 1.4 for C-LytA and LytA dimers; values that deviated from that of globular rigid particles. When considered together, present results give evidence that LytA amidase might be described as an elongated molecule consisting of at least four domains per subunit (two per module) designated here in as N1, N2, C1, and C2. Intersubunit cooperative interactions through the C2 domain in LytA dimer occur under all experimental conditions, while C-LytA requires the saturation of low affinity choline binding sites. The relevance of the structural features deduced here for LytA amidase is examined in connection with its biological function.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the acid denaturation of barnase and its dependence on ionic strength. From the pH dependence of the protein stability, we have obtained information about the titration properties of the native and denatured protein at temperatures ranging from 15 to 60 degrees C in the absence of chemical denaturant. It appears that both the native and the denatured state of barnase titrates at higher pH values in the presence of salt. The observation suggests that charge interactions are present, not only within the native fold but also within the denatured state, and that these interactions contribute to shift the pKa values from those of isolated model compounds. Upon addition of salt these repulsive interactions are shielded, and the electrostatic free energy of the native state, as well as the denatured state, is reduced. Accordingly, we suggest that the thermally denatured state of barnase is not an extended random coil without residue-residue interactions but is sufficiently compact to contain intramolecular charge-charge repulsions. The results further reveal that the native state of barnase contains at least one residue with a highly anomalous pKa value: At pH 0.3, the difference in degree of protonation between the native and the denatured state is still about 1 mol H+/mol protein.",

        "abstract": "The temperature, salt, and pH dependencies of unfolding of four recombinant (r) archaeal histones (rHFoB from the mesophile Methanobacterium formicicum, and rHMfA, rHMfB, and rHPyA1 from the hyperthermophiles Methanothermus fervidus and Pyrococcus strain GB-3a) have been determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal unfolding of these proteins is > 90% reversible, with concentration-dependent apparent Tm values and asymmetric unfolding transitions that are fit well by a two-state unfolding model in which a histone dimer unfolds to two random coil monomers. rHPyA1 dimers are stable in the absence of salt, whereas rHMfA, rHMfB, and rHFoB dimers unfold at 20 degrees C and pH 2 in solutions containing < 200 mM, < 400 mM, and < 1.5 M KCl, respectively. rHMfA, rHMfB, and rHFoB also experience significant cold denaturation in low salt concentrations and at low pH. The midpoint of thermal unfolding of a 1 M protein solution (T degree value) and the temperature dependency of the free energy of unfolding have been established for each histone, and both parameters correlate with the growth temperature of the originating archaeon. The changes in heat capacity upon unfolding are similar for the four histones, indicating that enhanced thermostability is not obtained by altering the curvature of the stability curve. Rather, the stability curves for the histones from the hyperthermophiles are displaced vertically to higher energies and laterally to higher Tmax values relative to the stability curve for rHFoB. The maximal free energies of unfolding for rHFoB, rHMfA, rHMfB, and rHPyA1 are 7.2, 15.5, 14.6, and 17.2 kcal/mol at 32, 35, 40, and 44 degrees C, respectively. T degree values for rHFoB, rHMfA, rHMfB, and rHPyA1 are 75, 104, 113, and 114 degrees C, respectively, at pH 5 in 0.2 M KCl.

Whilst mutations destabilizing the domain at position 56 did not enhance fibrillation, the N47A mutation increased the rate of amyloid fibril formation by 10-fold. Even under conditions of identical thermodynamic stability, the aggregation rate was much higher for the N47A mutant than for the WT domain. We conclude that the N47A mutation does not change the apparent mechanism of fibrillation or the morphology of the amyloid fibrils, and that its amyloidogenic property is due to its effect upon the rate of the conformational events leading to nucleation and not to its overall destabilizing effect.",

        "abstract": "Previous analysis of randomly generated multiple mutations within the core of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme suggested that the \"large-to-small\" substitution Leu121 to Ala (L121A) and the spatially adjacent \"small-to-large\" substitution Ala129 to Met (A129M) might be mutually compensating. To test this hypothesis, the individual variants L121A and A129M were generated, as well as the double \"size-switch\" mutant L121A/A129M. To make the interchange symmetrical, the combination of L121A with A129L to give L121A/A129L was also constructed. The single mutations were all destabilizing. Somewhat surprisingly, the small-to-large substitutions, which increase hydrophobic stabilization but can also introduce strain, were less deleterious than the large-to-small replacements. Both Ala129 --> Leu and Ala129 --> Met offset the destabilization of L121A by about 50%. Also, in contrast to typical Leu --> Ala core substitutions, which destabilize by 2 to 5 kcal/mol, Leu121 --> Ala slightly stabilized A129L and A129M. Crystal structure analysis showed that a combination of side-chain and backbone adjustments partially accommodated changes in side-chain volume, but only to a limited degree. For example, the cavity that was created by the Leu121 to Ala replacement actually became larger in L121A/A129L. The results demonstrate that the destabilization associated with a change in volume of one core residue can be specifically compensated by an offsetting volume change in an adjacent residue. It appears, however, that complete compensation is unlikely because it is difficult to reconstitute an equivalent set of interactions. The relatively slow evolution of core relative to surface residues appears, therefore, to be due to two factors. First, a mutation in a single core residue that results in a substantial change in size will normally lead to a significant loss in stability. Such mutations will presumably be selected against. Second, if a change in bulk does occur in a buried residue, it cannot normally be fully compensated by a mutation of an adjacent residue. Thus, the most probable response will tend to be reversion to the parent protein.",

The thermodynamic stability was measured at different temperatures combining denaturant and thermally induced unfolding. It was found that both proteins denature in a two-state equilibrium (native dimer versus unfolded monomer) and that CcdA has a significantly lower thermodynamic stability. Using a numerical model, which was developed earlier by us, and on the basis of the determined thermodynamic parameters the concentration dependence of the denaturation transition temperature was obtained for both proteins. This concentration dependence may be of physiological significance, as the concentration of both ccd addiction proteins cannot exceed a certain limit because their expression is controlled by autoregulation. The influence of DNA on the thermal stability of the two proteins was probed. It was found that cognate DNA increases the melting temperature of CcdA. In the presence of non-specific DNA the thermal stability was not changed. The melting temperature of CcdB was not influenced by the applied double-stranded oligonucleotides, neither cognate nor unspecific.",

        "abstract": "High-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and CD spectroscopy have been used to probe the structural stability and measure the folding/unfolding thermodynamics of a Pro117-->Gly variant of staphylococcal nuclease. It is shown that at neutral pH the thermal denaturation of this protein is well accounted for by a 2-state mechanism and that the thermally denatured state is a fully hydrated unfolded polypeptide. At pH 3.5, thermal denaturation results in a compact denatured state in which most, if not all, of the helical structure is missing and the beta subdomain apparently remains largely intact. At pH 3.0, no thermal transition is observed and the molecule exists in the compact denatured state within the 0-100 degrees C temperature interval. At high salt concentration and pH 3.5, the thermal unfolding transition exhibits 2 cooperative peaks in the heat capacity function, the first one corresponding to the transition from the native to the intermediate state and the second one to the transition from the intermediate to the unfolded state. As is the case with other proteins, the enthalpy of the intermediate is higher than that of the unfolded state at low temperatures, indicating that, under those conditions, its stabilization must be of an entropic origin. The folding intermediate has been modeled by structural thermodynamic calculations. Structure-based thermodynamic calculations also predict that the most probable intermediate is one in which the beta subdomain is essentially intact and the rest of the molecule unfolded, in agreement with the experimental data. The structural features of the equilibrium intermediate are similar to those of a kinetic intermediate previously characterized by hydrogen exchange and NMR spectroscopy.",

This involves a large conformational change in residues 81 to 83 and smaller shifts that extend 20 angstroms across the protein surface. Unexpectedly, all ten amino acid substitutions marginally reduce protein thermostability. This insensitivity of stability to the amino acid at position 86 is not simply explained by statistical and thermodynamic criteria for helical propensity.

This report focuses on elucidating the energetic and structural implications of these m-value differences in two Protein G mutants, containing Ala and Thr at position 53. These two proteins are representative of the high (m+) and low (m-) m-value mutants studied. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed no evidence of equilibrium intermediates. A comparison of GuHCl denaturation monitored by fluorescence and circular dichroism showed that secondary and tertiary structure denatured concomitantly. The rates of folding (286 S-1 for the m+ mutant and 952 S-1 for the m- mutant) and the rates of unfolding (11 S-1 for m+ mutant and 3 S-1 for the m- mutant) were significantly different, as determined by stopped-flow fluorescence. The relative solvation free energies of the transition states were identical for the two proteins (alpha ++ = 0.3). Small-angle X-ray scattering showed that the radius of gyration of the denatured state (Rgd) of the m+ mutant did not change with increasing denaturant concentrations (Rgd approximately 23 A); whereas, the Rgd of the m- mutant increased from approximately 17 A to 23 A with increasing denaturant concentration. The results indicate that the mutations exert significant effects in both the native and GuHCl-induced denatured state of these two proteins.",

Here, we report that GMPK from Escherichia coli (ecGMPK) assembles in solution and in the crystal as several different oligomers. Thermodynamic analysis of ecGMPK using differential scanning calorimetry shows that the enzyme is in equilibrium between a dimer and higher order oligomers, whose relative amounts depend on protein concentration, ionic strength, and the presence of ATP. Crystallographic structures of ecGMPK in the apo, GMP and GDP-bound forms were solved at 3.2A, 2.9A and 2.4A resolution, respectively. ecGMPK forms a hexamer with D3 symmetry in all crystal forms, in which the two nucleotide-binding domains are able to undergo closure comparable to that of monomeric GMPKs. The 2-fold and 3-fold interfaces involve a 20-residue C-terminal extension and a sequence signature, respectively, that are missing from monomeric eukaryotic GMPKs, explaining why ecGMPK forms oligomers. These signatures are found in GMPKs from proteobacteria, some of which are human pathogens. GMPKs from these bacteria are thus likely to form the same quaternary structures. The shift of the thermodynamic equilibrium towards the dimer at low ecGMPK concentration together with the observation that inter-subunit interactions partially occlude the ATP-binding site in the hexameric structure suggest that the dimer may be the active species at physiological enzyme concentration.",

The mutation of Gly 34 to Ser in Rb. capsulatus cytochrome c(2) has been characterized in terms of physicochemical properties and NMR in both redox states. A comparison of the wild-type cytochrome c(2), the G34S mutation, and the P35A mutation is presented in the context of differences in chemical shifts, the differences in NOE patterns, and structural changes resulting from oxidation of the reduced cytochrome. G34S is substantially destabilized relative to wild-type (2.2 kcal/mol in the oxidized state) but similarly destabilized relative to P35A. Nevertheless, differences in terms of the impact of the mutations on specific structural regions are found when comparing G34S and P35A. Although available data indicates that the overall secondary structure of G34S and wild-type cytochrome c(2) are similar, a number of both perturbations of hydrogen bond networks and interactions with internal waters are found. Thus, the impact of the mutation at position 35 is propagated throughout the cytochrome but with alterations at defined sites within the molecule. Interestingly, we find that the substitution of serine at position 34 results in a perturbation of the heme beta meso and the methyl-5 protons. This suggests that the hydroxyl and beta carbon are positioned away from the solvent and toward the heme. This has the consequence of preferentially stabilizing the oxidized state in G34S, thus, altering hydrogen bond networks which involve the heme propionate, internal waters, and key amino acid side chains. The results presented provide important new insights into the stability and solution structure of the cytochrome c(2).",

Similar results were obtained with ribonuclease Sa where Asp25Lys is 0.9 kcal/mol and Glu74Lys is 1.1 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that protein stability can be increased by improving the coulombic interactions among charged groups on the protein surface.

        "abstract": "Despite decades of intense study, the complementarity of beta-lactams for beta-lactamases and penicillin binding proteins is poorly understood. For most of these enzymes, beta-lactam binding involves rapid formation of a covalent intermediate. This makes measuring the equilibrium between bound and free beta-lactam difficult, effectively precluding measurement of the interaction energy between the ligand and the enzyme. Here, we explore the energetic complementarity of beta-lactams for the beta-lactamase AmpC through reversible denaturation of adducts of the enzyme with beta-lactams. AmpC from Escherichia coli was reversibly denatured by temperature in a two-state manner with a temperature of melting (Tm) of 54.6 degrees C and a van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (deltaH(VH)) of 182 kcal/mol. Solvent denaturation gave a Gibbs free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant (deltaG(u)H2O) of 14.0 kcal/mol. Ligand binding perturbed the stability of the enzyme. The penicillin cloxacillin stabilized AmpC by 3.2 kcal/mol (deltaTm = +5.8 degrees C); the monobactam aztreonam stabilized the enzyme by 2.7 kcal/mol (deltaTm = +4.9 degrees C). Both acylating inhibitors complement the active site. Surprisingly, the oxacephem moxalactam and the carbapenem imipenem both destabilized AmpC, by 1.8 kcal/mol (deltaTm = -3.2 degrees C) and 0.7 kcal/mol (deltaTm = -1.2 degrees C), respectively. These beta-lactams, which share nonhydrogen substituents in the 6(7)alpha position of the beta-lactam ring, make unfavorable noncovalent interactions with the enzyme. Complexes of AmpC with transition state analog inhibitors were also reversibly denatured; both benzo(b)thiophene-2-boronic acid (BZBTH2B) and p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate (PNPP) stabilized AmpC. Finally, a catalytically inactive mutant of AmpC, Y150F, was reversibly denatured. It was 0.7 kcal/mol (deltaTm = -1.3 degrees C) less stable than wild-type (WT) by thermal denaturation. Both the cloxacillin and the moxalactam adducts with Y150F were significantly destabilized relative to their WT counterparts, suggesting that this residue plays a role in recognizing the acylated intermediate of the beta-lactamase reaction. Reversible denaturation allows for energetic analyses of the complementarity of AmpC for beta-lactams, through ligand binding, and for itself, through residue substitution. Reversible denaturation may be a useful way to study ligand complementarity to other beta-lactam binding proteins as well.",

To model the effects of fusion of single foldons to give a multi-foldon protein, we engineered a \"double-CI2\" protein, in which another CI2 polypeptide was inserted into the loop region of the parent CI2. CD and HSQC spectra demonstrated that while the double-CI2 protein adopted two kinds of native conformations, CI2-like structure was almost preserved in both the domains of double-CI2. In the folding kinetic studies, double-CI2 exhibited a remarkable rollover of the observed folding rates at low denaturant concentrations, indicating that double-CI2 accumulated a kinetic folding intermediate. The different folding mechanisms between WT-CI2 and double-CI2 support the present view that protein size or number of domains is an important determinant for formation of folding intermediates.",

        "abstract": "Three mutants of staphylococcal nuclease containing a tryptophan substitution have been examined in the full length (149 residues) protein and in a large fragment (residues 1 to 136). The large fragments are not in the native state and are a good model of the denatured state. However, these large fragments do show signs of residual structure that breaks down upon titration with guanidine hydrochloride. They share some similarities with what has become known as the molten globule state. The thermal unfolding of these mutant fragments was followed by tryptophan fluorescence. Tryptophan fluorescence was treated as an order parameter and analyzed to determine the order of the observed transition. The critical exponent of the order parameter as the transition temperature is approached is significantly higher than the value of 1/2 predicted by mean field theory for a second-order transition and is similar to that observed for the transition of the full length, wild-type, protein. This is strong evidence that the breakdown of this intermediate compact denatured state is a cooperative, first-order phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "The pK values of the histidine residues in ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) are unusually high: 7.8 (His-92), 7.9 (His-40), and 7.3 (His-27) [Inagaki et al. (1981) J. Biochem. 89, 1185-1195]. In the RNase T1 mutant Glu-58----Ala, the first two pK values are reduced to 7.4 (His-92) and 7.1 (His-40). These lower pKs were expected since His-92 (5.5 A) and His-40 (3.7 A) are in close proximity to Glu-58 at the active site. The conformational stability of RNase T1 increases by over 4 kcal/mol between pH 9 and 5, and this can be entirely accounted for by the greater affinity for protons by the His residues in the folded protein (average pK = 7.6) than in the unfolded protein (pk approximately 6.6). Thus, almost half of the net conformational stability of RNase T1 results from a difference between the pK values of the histidine residues in the folded and unfolded conformations. In the Glu-58----Ala mutant, the increase in stability between pH 9 and 5 is halved (approximately 2 kcal/mol), as expected on the basis of the lower pK values for the His residues in the folded protein (average pK = 7.1). As a consequence, RNase T1 is more stable than the mutant below pH 7.5, and less stable above pH 7.5. These results emphasize the importance of measuring the conformational stability as a function of pH when comparing proteins differing in structure.",

Equilibrium circular dichroism studies of the urea-induced unfolding reaction at neutral pH revealed that both types of ionic interactions, localized primarily in the N-terminal portion of the molecule, enhance the stability of the native coiled-coil. By contrast, comparable stopped-flow circular dichroism studies indicate that the salt-bridge interactions, with one possible exception, are not well formed in the transition state for folding. Although the E22Q/R25A double mutant failed to fold, fragmentation studies suggest that the E22/R25 intramolecular salt-bridge may play a critical role in stabilizing C-terminal nascent helices that drive the association reaction. The remaining salt-bridges appear to stabilize the parallel-stranded coiled-coil architecture of GCN4-p1 only after the peptide traverses the rate-limiting, dimeric transition state.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding of the CuA domain of cytochrome oxidase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus, induced by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl)1 at different temperatures, has been monitored by CD as well by electronic absorption (with the oxidized protein) and by fluorescence (with the reduced protein). The same unfolding curves were obtained with the different methods, providing evidence for a two-state model for the unfolding equilibrium. This was also supported by the shape of the unfolding equilibrium curves and by the observed refolding of the unfolded, oxidized protein on dilution of the denaturant. The oxidized protein cannot be unfolded by GuHCl at room temperature, and it was found to be thermally very stable as well, since, even in the presence of 7 M GuHCl, it is not fully unfolded until above 80 degrees C. For the reduced protein at room temperature, the unfolding equilibrium curve yielded a folding free energy of -65 kJ/mol. The corresponding value for the oxidized protein (-85 kJ/mol) could be estimated indirectly from a thermodynamic cycle connecting the folded and unfolded forms in both oxidation states and the known reduction potentials of the metal site in the folded and unfolded states; the potential is increased on unfolding, consistent with the higher folding stability of the oxidized form. The difference in folding stability between the oxidized and reduced proteins (20 kJ/mol) is exceptionally high, and this is ascribed to the unique structure of the dinuclear CuA site. The unfolded, reduced protein was found to refold partially on oxidation with ferricyanide.",

        "abstract": "The conformational stability (delta G) of muscle acylphosphatase, a small alpha/beta globular protein, has been determined as a function of temperature, urea concentration, and pH. A combination of thermally induced and urea-induced unfolding, monitored by far-UV circular dichroism, was used to define the conformational stability over a wide range of temperature. Through analysis of all these data, the heat capacity change upon unfolding (delta Cp) could be estimated, allowing the determination of the temperature dependence of the main thermodynamic functions (delta G, delta H, delta S). Thermal unfolding in the presence of urea made it possible to extend such thermodynamic analysis to examine these parameters as a function of urea concentration. The results indicate that acylphosphatase is a relatively unstable protein with a delta G(H2O) of 22 +/- 1 kJ mol-1 at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. The midpoints of both thermal and chemical denaturation are also relatively low. Urea denaturation curves over the pH range 2-12 have allowed the pH dependence of delta G to be determined and indicate that the maximum stability of the protein occurs near pH 5.5. While the dependence of delta G on urea (the m value) does not vary with temperature, a significant increase has been found at low pH values, suggesting that the overall dimensions of the unfolded state are significantly affected by the number of charges within the polypeptide chain. The comparison of these data with those from other small proteins indicates that the pattern of conformational stability is defined by individual sequences and not by the overall structural fold.",

Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding of hFGF-1 and nFGF-1 monitored by fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) shows that the FGF-1 isoforms differ significantly in their thermodynamic stabilities. GdnHCl-induced unfolding of nFGF-1 follows a two-state (Native state to Denatured state(s)) mechanism without detectable intermediate(s). By contrast, unfolding of hFGF-1 monitored by fluorescence, far-UV circular dichroism, size-exclusion chromatography, and NMR spectroscopy shows that the unfolding process is noncooperative and proceeds with the accumulation of stable intermediate(s) at 0.96 M GdnHCl. The intermediate (in hFGF-1) populated maximally at 0.96 M GdnHCl has molten globule-like properties and shows strong binding affinity to the hydrophobic dye, 1-Anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS). Refolding kinetics of hFGF-1 and nFGF-1 monitored by stopped-flow fluorescence reveal that hFGF-1 and nFGF-1 adopts different folding mechanisms. The observed differences in the folding/unfolding mechanisms of nFGF-1 and hFGF-1 are proposed to be either due to differential stabilizing effects of the charged denaturant (Gdn(+) Cl(-)) on the intermediate state(s) and/or due to differences in the structural interactions stabilizing the native conformation(s) of the FGF-1 isoforms.",

        "abstract": "To try to resolve the loss of stability in the temperature-sensitive mutant of T4 lysozyme, Arg 96 --> His, all of the remaining 18 naturally occurring amino acids were substituted at site 96. Also, in response to suggestions that the charged residues Lys85 and Asp89, which are 5-8 A away, may have important effects, each of these amino acids was replaced with alanine. Crystal structures were determined for many of the variants. With the exception of the tryptophan and valine mutants R96W and R96V, the crystallographic analysis shows that the substituted side chain following the path of Arg96 in wildtype (WT). The melting temperatures of the variants decrease by up to approximately 16 degrees C with WT being most stable. There are two site 96 replacements, with lysine or glutamine, that leave the stability close to that of WT. The only element that the side chains of these residues have in common with the WT arginine is the set of three carbon atoms at the C(alpha), C(beta), and C(gamma) positions. Although each side chain is long and flexible with a polar group at the distal position, the details of the hydrogen bonding to the rest of the protein differ in each case. Also, the glutamine replacement lacks a positive charge. This shows that there is some adaptability in achieving full stabilization at this site. At the other extreme, to be maximally destabilizing a mutation at site 96 must not only eliminate favorable interactions but also introduce an unfavorable element such as steric strain or a hydrogen-bonding group that remains unsatisfied. Overall, the study highlights the essential need for atomic resolution site-specific structural information to understand and to predict the stability of mutant proteins. It can be very misleading to simply assume that conservative amino acid substitutions cause small changes in stability, whereas large stability changes are associated with nonconservative replacements.",

HgammaS and BgammaS are found to be authentic according to their spectral and hydrodynamic properties. Both full-length proteins and isolated domains are monomeric and exhibit high thermal and pH stabilities. The thermodynamic characterization made use of chemically and thermally-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions at varying pH. In spite of its exemplary two-domain structure, gammaS-crystallin does not show bimodal unfolding characteristics. In the case of BgammaS, at pH 7.0, the C-terminal domain is less stable than the N-terminal one, whereas for HgammaS the opposite holds true. Differential scanning calorimetry confirms the results of chemically-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions. Over the whole pH range between 2.0 and 11.5, HgammaS-crystallin and its isolated domains (HgammaS-N and HgammaS-C) follow the two-state model. The two-state unfolding of the intact two-domain protein points to the close similarity of the stabilities of the constituent domains. Obviously, interactions between the domains do not contribute significantly to the overall stability of gammaS-crystallin. In contrast, the structurally closely related gammaB-crystallin owes much of its extreme stability to domain interactions.",

The observed delta Hcal values for bleached and unbleached rod outer segment disk membranes exhibit membrane concentration dependences which plateau at protein concentrations beyond 1.5 mg/mL. For partially bleached samples of rod outer segment disk membranes, the calorimetric enthalpy change for opsin appears to be somewhat dependent on the degree of bleaching, indicating intramembrane nearest neighbor interactions which affect the unfolding of opsin. Delta Hcal and Tm are particularly useful for assessing stability and testing for completeness of regeneration of rhodopsin from opsin. Other factors such as sample preparation and the presence of low concentrations of ethanol also affect the delta Hcal values while the Tm values remain fairly constant. This shows that the delta Hcal is a sensitive parameter for monitoring environmental changes of rhodopsin and opsin.",

It was shown that the recombinant domain is monomeric in solution and that it comprises secondary structural elements similar to those observed in the crystal structure of the hexameric enzyme. The recombinant domain is thermostable and undergoes reversible and cooperative thermal unfolding in the pH range 5.90-8.00 with melting temperatures between 75.1 and 68.0 degrees C.

The isolated domain is monomeric as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation and concentration-dependent CD. Complete 1H chemical shift assignments were obtained using standard methods. 2D-NMR experiments show that the isolated domain adopts the same structure as seen in the full-length protein. It consists of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet sandwiched between two helixes. Thermal and urea unfolding transitions are cooperative, and the unfolding curves generated from different experimental techniques, 1D-NMR, far-UV CD, near-UV CD, and fluorescence, are superimposable. These results suggest that the protein folds by a two-state mechanism. The thermal midpoint of folding is 77 +/- 2 degrees C at pD 8.0, and the domain has a delta G degree folding = 2.8 +/- 0.8 kcal/mol at 40 degrees C, pH 7.0. Near the thermal midpoint of the unfolding transition, the 1D-NMR peaks are significantly broadened, indicating that folding is occurring on the intermediate exchange time scale. The rate of folding was determined by fitting the NMR spectra to a two-state chemical exchange model. Similar folding rates were measured for Phe 5, located in the first beta-strand, and for Tyr 25, located in the short helix between strands two and three. The domain folds extremely rapidly with a folding rate constant of 2000 s-1 near the midpoint of the equilibrium thermal unfolding transition.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding of brain pyridoxal kinase by guanidinium HCl has been investigated at equilibrium. The overall process was reversible as judged from the complete recovery of catalytic activity after removal of guanidinium HCl. Unfolding of pyridoxal kinase was monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The steepness of the spectroscopic changes between 0.2 and 1.5 M guanidinium HCl, and the lack of any discernible plateau suggests that unfolding of the monomer is a cooperative process. A compact intermediate on the unfolding pathway of pyridoxal kinase could not be detected by the method of denaturant gel filtration. The fluorescent analogs of the substrates ATP and pyridoxal were used to assess differences in stability among the domains of the protein. Based on fluorescence and steady emission anisotropy results, it is postulated that the nucleotide domain is more stable than the pyridoxal domain of the kinase.",

        "abstract": "The NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese influences many of its properties, ranging from mitochondrial import to folding. Rhodanese truncated by >9 residues is degraded in Escherichia coli. Mutant enzymes with lesser truncations are recoverable and active, but they show altered active site reactivities (Trevino, R. J., Tsalkova, T., Dramer, G., Hardesty, B., Chirgwin, J. M., and Horowitz, P. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27841-27847), suggesting that the NH2-terminal sequence stabilizes the overall structure. We tested aspects of the conformations of these shortened species. Intrinsic and probe fluorescence showed that truncation decreased stability and increased hydrophobic exposure, while near UV CD suggested altered tertiary structure. Under native conditions, truncated rhodanese bound to GroEL and was released and reactivated by adding ATP and GroES, suggesting equilibrium between native and non-native conformers. Furthermore, GroEL assisted folding of denatured mutants to the same extent as wild type, although at a reduced rate. X-ray crystallography showed that Delta1-7 crystallized isomorphously with wild type in polyethyleneglycol, and the structure was highly conserved. Thus, the missing NH2-terminal residues that contribute to global stability of the native structure in solution do not significantly alter contacts at the atomic level of the crystallized protein. The two-domain structure of rhodanese was not significantly altered by drastically different crystallization conditions or crystal packing suggesting rigidity of the native rhodanese domains and the stabilization of the interdomain interactions by the crystal environment. The results support a model in which loss of interactions near the rhodanese NH2 terminus does not distort the folded native structure but does facilitate the transition in solution to a molten globule state, which among other things, can interact with molecular chaperones.",

The substitution F25A severely impaired the functional properties of the enzyme. Strains expressing all other mutations can grow on methionine sulfoxide with growth efficiencies of 45-60% that of the wild type at 37 degrees, and essentially identical at 42 degrees. At both temperatures, however, strains harboring the substitutions F25V and F25Y had lower growth rates and formed smaller colonies. In another in vivo assay, only the wild type and the F25I substitution allowed growth of phage T3/7 at 37 degrees, demonstrating that subtle modifications of the protein interior at position 25 Ile/Leu or Phe/Tyr) can produce significant biological effects. All F25 mutants were good substrates for E. coli thioredoxin reductase. Although turnover rates and apparent Km values were significantly lower for all mutants compared to the wild type, catalytic efficiency of thioredoxin reductase was similar for all substrates. Determination of the free energy of unfolding showed that the aliphatic substitutions (Val, Leu, Ile) significantly destabilized the protein, whereas the F25Y substitution did not affect protein stability. Thus, thermodynamic stability of R. sphaeroides thioredoxin variants is not correlated with the distinct functional effects observed both in vivo and in vitro.",

        "abstract": "It has been proposed (Randall, L. L., and Hardy, S. J. S. (1986) Cell 46, 921-928) that export of protein involves a kinetic partitioning between the pathway that leads to productive export and the pathway that leads to the folding of polypeptides into a stable conformation that is incompatible with export. As predicted from this model, a decrease in the rate of export of maltose-binding protein to the periplasmic space in Escherichia coli resulting from a defect in the leader sequence was able to be partially overcome by a mutation that slowed the folding of the precursor, thereby increasing the time in which the polypeptide was competent for export. (Liu, G., Topping, T. B., Cover, W. H., and Randall, L. L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14790-14793). Here we describe mutations of the gene encoding ribose-binding protein that were selected as suppressors of a defect in export of that protein and that alter the folding pathway. We propose that selection of such suppressors may provide a general method to obtain mutations that affect the folding properties of any protein that can be expressed and exported in E. coli.",

        "abstract": "It has been generally believed that polar residues are usually located on the surface of protein structures. However, there are many polar groups in the interior of the structures in reality. To evaluate the contribution of such buried polar groups to the conformational stability of a protein, nonpolar to polar mutations (L8T, A9S, A32S, I56T, I59T, I59S, A92S, V93T, A96S, V99T, and V100T) in the interior of a human lysozyme were examined. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter, and the crystal structures were analyzed by X-ray crystallography. If a polar group had a heavy energy cost to be buried, a mutant protein would be remarkably destabilized. However, the stability (Delta G) of the Ala to Ser and Val to Thr mutant human lysozymes was comparable to that of the wild-type protein, suggesting a low-energy penalty of buried polar groups. The structural analysis showed that all polar side chains introduced in the mutant proteins were able to find their hydrogen bond partners, which are ubiquitous in protein structures. The empirical structure-based calculation of stability change (Delta Delta G) [Takano et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 12698--12708] revealed that the mutant proteins decreased the hydrophobic effect contributing to the stability (Delta G(HP)), but this destabilization was recovered by the hydrogen bonds newly introduced. The present study shows the favorable contribution of polar groups with hydrogen bonds in the interior of protein molecules to the conformational stability.",

Contrary to expectation, we found that Gdn-HCl at low concentrations refolds acid-unfolded apomyoglobin and cytochrome c, stabilizing the molten globule state, i.e. a compact denatured state with a significant amount of secondary structure, but substantially disordered tertiary structure. A further increase in Gdn-HCl concentration, above 1 M, caused co-operative unfolding of the molten globule state. Similar sequential folding and unfolding transitions were also observed at neutral pH with a synthetic amphiphilic peptide consisting of Lys and Leu residues, indicating the generality of the phenomenon. Although the Gdn-HCl-induced refolding and unfolding transitions were puzzling at first glance, we show that they are readily interpreted in terms of the differential action of Gdn-HCl. We also show that the comparison of the unfolding curves for the molten globule and native states provides a measure of the buried surface area upon formation of the molten globule state.",

Stability changes arising from identical mutations at these two buried sites are quite different, suggesting that one site is more rigid than the other. Reversals of residues at positions 35 and 47 confirm that their environments are distinct. Mutants containing weakly polar residues at these two sites suggest that the protein interior is more polar than a liquid hydrocarbon. Interactions between residues at the two sites appear to be minimal. These observations are compatible with a view of protein interiors that incorporates properties of liquid hydrocarbons but also includes polar interactions and a site-dependent \"packing energy\" associated with changes in internal structure.",

        "abstract": "We have used the electron spin resonance (ESR) site-directed spin-labeling (SDSL) technique to examine the guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) induced denaturation of several sites along a transmembrane beta-strand located in the ferric enterobactin receptor, FepA. In addition, we have continued the characterization of the beta-strand previously identified by our group (Klug CS et al., 1997, Biochemistry 36:13027-13033) to extend from the periplasm to the extracellular surface loop in FepA, an integral membrane protein containing a beta-barrel motif comprised of a series of antiparallel beta-strands that is responsible for transport of the iron chelate, ferric enterobactin (FeEnt), across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli and many related enteric bacteria. We have previously shown that a large surface loop in FepA containing the FeEnt binding site denatures independently of the beta-barrel domain (Klug CS et al., 1995, Biochemistry 34:14230-14236). The SDSL approach allows examination of the unfolding at individual residues independent of the global unfolding of the protein. This work shows that sites along the beta-strand that are exposed to the aqueous lumen of the channel denature more rapidly and with higher cooperativity than the surface loop, while sites on the hydrophobic side of the beta-strand undergo a limited degree of noncooperative unfolding and do not fully denature even at high (e.g., 4 M) Gdn-HCl concentrations. We conclude that, in a transmembrane beta-strand, the local environment of a given residue plays a significant role in the loss of structure at each site.",

Acid-unfolded state was characterized at pH 4.0 with residual secondary structure, disrupted tertiary spectrum and red-shifted fluorescence spectrum with decreased intensity. Further decrease in pH lead to formation of secondary structure and acid-induced molten globule state was found to be stabilized at pH 1.4, with exposed tryptophan residues and hydrophobic patches. Notably, interesting finding of this study was characterization of acid-induced state at pH 0.8 with higher secondary structure content than native lipase, regain in tertiary spectrum and induction of compact conformation.

        "abstract": "Aerolysin is a bacterial pore-forming toxin that is secreted as an inactive precursor, which is then processed at its COOH terminus and finally forms a circular heptameric ring which inserts into membranes to form a pore. We have analyzed the stability of the precursor proaerolysin and the heptameric complex. Equilibrium unfolding induced by urea and guanidinium hydrochloride was monitored by measuring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein. Proaerolysin was found to unfold in two steps corresponding to the unfolding of the large COOH-terminal lobe followed by the unfolding of the small NH(2)-terminal domain. We show that proaerolysin contains two disulfide bridges which strongly contribute to the stability of the toxin and protect it from proteolytic attack. The stability of aerolysin was greatly enhanced by polymerization into a heptamer. Two regions of the protein, corresponding to amino acids 180-307 and 401-427, were identified, by limited proteolysis, NH(2)-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight, as being responsible for stability and maintenance of the heptamer. These regions are presumably involved in monomer/monomer interactions in the heptameric protein and are exclusively composed of beta structure. The stability of the aerolysin heptamer is reminiscent of that of pathogenic, fimbrial protein aggregates found in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.",

In contrast to IGPS from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, tIGPS shows high catalytic activity at room temperature and only weak product inhibition. In order to test the hypothesis that salt bridges in a critical context contribute to the high thermostability of tIGPS, two solvent-exposed salt bridges were selected, based on its three-dimensional structure, for individual disruption by site-directed mutagenesis. The first salt bridge fixes the N terminus to the core of the protein, and the second serves as a clamp between helices alpha1 and alpha8, which are widely separated in sequence but adjacent in the (betaalpha)8-barrel.

The mutant proteins were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis at residue positions located on the surface of the folded protein. The m value, which represents the preferential free energy of interaction of urea with the unfolded form in comparison to that with the folded state, was determined from equilibrium urea-induced unfolding curves. Mutant proteins for which the m values were significantly greater than (m(+) mutant forms), significantly smaller than (m(-) mutant forms), or similar to (m(0) mutant forms) the m value determined for the wild-type protein were studied. The unfolded forms of the m(0), m(+) and m(-) mutant proteins represent different components within the unfolded form ensemble, which differ from each other in their solvent-exposed surface areas. Hence, the m value has been used as a measure of residual structure in the unfolded form. To further understand the nature of structures present in the unfolded form ensemble, the effects of the salt KCl on the stabilities of the wild-type and the mutant proteins, as well as on the structures present in the unfolded form ensemble, were also studied. It was found that the m values of the m(0), m(+) and m(-) mutant proteins all converge to the wild-type m value in the presence of KCl. This result indicates that the salt modulates residual structure in the unfolded form by screening electrostatic interactions that maintain compact and expanded components in the unfolded protein ensemble. The use of free energy cycles has allowed the effect of salt on the structure and free energy of the unfolded protein to be related to the stability of the protein.",

In this work, we have compared the structure and binding of a class A protein, Mrp4, and a class C protein, Arp4, expressed by the same bacterial strain. Circular dichroism spectra, gel filtration, and binding assays showed that both proteins had a coiled-coil dimer configuration and a high-affinity binding at 20 degrees C. However, striking differences were seen at 37 degrees C. The class A protein, Mrp4, was still a coiled-coil dimer with high affinity binding activity, whereas the class C protein, Arp4, had lost both the coiled-coil structure and binding activity. Raising the temperature even higher, Mrp4 retained the coiled-coil structure up to 70-90 degrees C. Furthermore, a recombinant protein, Mrp(C), in which the A-repeats of Mrp4 were replaced by the C-repeats of Arp4, lost its coiled-coil structure and fibrinogen-binding around 40-45 degrees C. These results suggest a high thermal stability of class A proteins and a low stability of class C proteins and that the structural basis for this can be found partly in the A- and C-repeats. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the A- and C-repeats, revealed a large difference, 87% and 45%, respectively, in the content of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the positions regarded as important for the formation of the coiled-coil structure. In particular, several alanine residues in the A-repeats were replaced by serine residues in the C-repeats. Our results suggest that important structural and functional changes within the M protein family have evolved by specific hydrophobic-nonhydrophobic amino acid replacements.",

        "abstract": "Human PrP (residues 91-231) expressed in Escherichia coli can adopt several conformations in solution depending on pH, redox conditions and denaturant concentration. Oxidised PrP at neutral pH, with the disulphide bond intact, is a soluble monomer which contains 47% alpha-helix and corresponds to PrPC. Denaturation studies show that this structure has a relatively small, solvent-excluded core and unfolds to an unstructured state in a single, co-operative transition with a DeltaG for folding of -5.6 kcal mol-1. The unfolding behaviour is sensitive to pH and at 4.0 or below the molecule unfolds via a stable folding intermediate. This equilibrium intermediate has a reduced helical content and aggregates over several hours. When the disulphide bond is reduced the protein adopts different conformations depending upon pH. At neutral pH or above, the reduced protein has an alpha-helical fold, which is identical to that observed for the oxidised protein. At pH 4 or below, the conformation rearranges to a fold that contains a high proportion of beta-sheet structure. In the reduced state the alpha- and beta-forms are slowly inter-convertible whereas when oxidised the protein can only adopt an alpha-conformation in free solution. The data we present here shows that the human prion protein can exist in multiple conformations some of which are known to be capable of forming fibrils. The precise conformation that human PrP adopts and the pathways for unfolding are dependent upon solvent conditions. The conditions we examined are within the range that a protein may encounter in sub-cellular compartments and may have implications for the mechanism of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in vivo. Since the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is accompanied by a switch in secondary structure from alpha to beta, this system provides a useful model for studying major structural rearrangements in the prion protein.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium denaturation of human growth hormone (hGH) derived from heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli was studied. Denaturation was measured by ultraviolet absorbance, intrinsic fluorescence, far ultraviolet circular dichroism, and size exclusion chromatography. The denaturation transitions obtained from each method of detection were coincident, indicating a two-state denaturation mechanism. The denaturation transitions were independent of the concentration of protein. The Gibbs free energy of unfolding is 14.5 +/- 1 kcal/mol. Human growth hormone contains two disulfide bridges between residues 53-165 (large loop) and 182-189 (small loop). The small loop was selectively reduced and cysteines alkylated with iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide. The tetra-S-carbamidomethylated and tetra-S-carboxymethylated derivatives were also prepared. All S-alkylated hGH forms were indistinguishable from the native conformations in the absence of denaturant by far ultraviolet circular dichroism. The circular dichroism-detected equilibrium denaturation of each derivative was determined and the Gibbs free energy of unfolding of the tetra-S-modified forms was 5.3 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol and of the di-S-alkylated derivatives was 11.2 +/- 0.8 kcal/mol. These results for hGH are different than previously obtained results for bovine, ovine, and rat growth hormones. Stable equilibrium intermediates have been identified for these non-human species of growth hormone. The stable intermediates observed in the denaturation of reduced, alkylated hGH or nonhunam growth hormones are similar and characterized as compact, helical, lacking native-like tertiary structure, and having a tendency to aggregate. The apparent absence of intermediates in the folding of oxidized hGH is due to the relative instability of intermediates compared with their native structures. The hGH conformation is at least 5 kcal/mol more stable than the growth hormones from other species. Reduction and alkylation of the disulfide bridges of hGH diminish the stability differences between the native and intermediate states, such that the denaturation behavior is similar to the nonhuman growth hormones with well-populated intermediates. Most proteins do not demonstrate equilibrium folding intermediates presumably because intermediates are only marginally stable in conditions that disrupt the native state. The folding results with hGH and alkylated hGH substantiate this.",

        "abstract": "To elucidate the energetic features of the anomalously high-level stabilization of a hyperthermophile pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (PfPCP) from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus, equilibrium and kinetic studies of the guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl)-induced unfolding and refolding were carried out with CD measurements at 220 nm in comparison with those from the mesophile homologue (BaPCP) from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The mutant protein of PfPCP substituted with Ser at both Cys142 and Cys188 (PfC142/188S) was used. The GuHCl unfolding for PfC142/188S and BaPCP was reversible. It was difficult to obtain the equilibrated unfolding curve of the hyperthermophile proteins at temperatures below 50 degreesC and pH 7, because of the remarkably slow rate of the unfolding. The unfolding for PfC142/188S attained equilibrium after 7 days at 60 degreesC, resulting in the coincidence between the unfolding and refolding curves. The Gibbs energy change of unfolding, DeltaGH2O (56.6 kJ/mol), for PfC142/188S at 60 degreesC and pH 7 was dramatically higher than that (7.6 kJ/mol) for BaPCP at 40 degreesC and pH 7. The unfolding and refolding kinetics for PfC142/188S and BaPCP at both 25 and 60 degreesC at pH 7 were approximated as a single exponential. The rate constant in water (kuH2O) of the unfolding reaction for PfC142/188S (1.6 x 10(-)15 s-1) at 25 degreesC and pH 7 was drastically reduced by 7 orders of magnitude compared to that (1.5 x 10(-)8 s-1) for BaPCP, whereas the refolding rates (krH2O) in water for PfC142/188S (9.3 x 10(-)2 s-1) and BaPCP (3.6 x 10(-)1 s-1) at 25 degreesC and pH 7 were similar. These results indicate that the greater stability of the hyperthermophile PCP was characterized by the drastically slow unfolding rate.",

Kinetic analysis in terms of a sequential three-state mechanism provides insight into the contribution of specific interactions within the ubiquitin core to the structural stability of the native and intermediate states. The observations that disruptive mutations and/or addition of denaturants result in an apparent two-state folding process with slower rates is explained by the destabilization of a partially folded intermediate, which is in rapid equilibrium with unfolded states. The model predicts that under sufficiently stabilizing conditions kinetic intermediates may become populated even for proteins showing apparent two-state kinetics.",

        "abstract": "It was revealed from the crystal structure analysis of S-ovalbumin (S-OVA) formed by alkaline treatment that Ser164, Ser236, and Ser320 take the D-amino acid residue configuration (Yamasaki et al., J Biol Chem 2003; 278:35524-35530). To address the implications of a D-configuration for these Ser residues in S-OVA formation, three mutant OVAs (S164A, S236A, and S320A) were generated to compare their thermostabilities before and after alkaline treatment. Following alkaline treatment, S236A showed a marked increase in melting temperature similar to the wild type (DeltaT(m), +9 degrees C) which corresponded to the formation of S-OVA, whereas the increment in T(m) for both S164A and S320A was only 4.5 degrees C. Furthermore, the T(m) value of the double mutant S164/320A remained unchanged after alkaline treatment, supporting the relevance of Ser164 and Ser320 for thermostabilization of OVA. As Arg142 was predicted to interact with D-Ser164 upon S-OVA formation, it was substituted to Ala to generate R142A. The resulting increment in T(m) of mutant R142A after alkaline treatment was 5.8 degrees C. The double mutant R142/S320A was therefore prepared to eliminate the participation of Ser320 in thermostabilization, and its T(m) value was compared before and after alkaline treatment. As expected, the increase in T(m) for the double mutant was only 1.2 degrees C. Taken together, the data suggest that D-configuration of Ser164 caused by alkaline treatment favors interaction with Arg142 through conformational changes of the side chain. These results strongly supported the participation of the configurational inversion of both Ser164 and Ser320 residues in the formation of S-OVA.",

        "abstract": "The structural organization of streptokinase was established through detailed study of its denaturation by differential scanning calorimetry. Streptokinase exhibited a complex endotherm whose shape was sensitive to changing pH. In all cases the endotherms were easily described by four two-state transitions indicating unambiguously the presence of four independently folded domains in the molecule. Two of them were slightly destabilized by lowering pH from 7.0 to 3.8 while the other two were stabilized in this pH range. Two proteolytic fragments of streptokinase were examined, a 37-kDa fragment beginning at Ile1 with a cleavage following Phe62, and a 17-kDa fragment beginning at Lys 147. At pH 8.5, three two-state transitions were observed in the former and two in the latter indicating this many domains in each and suggesting that the fragments are formed by a step-wise removal of individual domains from the parent molecule. Comparison of the melting of these fragments with that of streptokinase allowed the first two transitions in the parent protein to be assigned to the melting of two NH2-terminal domains and the two higher-temperature transitions to the melting of the two COOH-terminal domains. The latter two domains strongly interact with each other since the absence of the most stable extreme COOH-terminal domain in both fragments resulted in a strong destabilization of its neighbor whose melting occurred with a midpoint near room temperature. The two NH2-terminal domains seem to be more independent. One of them melts similarly in the parent protein and both fragments while the other, formed by the 1-146 region, is less stable in the 37-kDa fragment. This destabilization is most probably due to the cleavage after Phe62 which, based on the sequence similarity of streptokinase with serine proteases, may be part of a surface-oriented loop.",

PAI-1 is produced in an active form but converts to an inactive or latent form with a half-life of approximately 1 h at pH 7.5, 37 degrees C. This study describes the construction, expression, and characterization of PAI-1 mutants with increased functional stability. Three mutations that disrupt an ion pair, present in latent PAI-1, between Arg-30 and Glu-350 (P4'), were introduced into recombinant PAI-1. All three mutant proteins maintained normal functional activity against both uPA and tPA. However, the half-life of each purified PAI-1 mutant was extended compared to the 1.1 h observed for wild-type PAI-1 (wtPAI-1) (1.2 h for Glu-350-->Arg, 2.0 h for Glu-350-->Pro, and 2.1 h for the Arg-30-->Glu mutation). An additional PAI-1 variant containing a second mutation designed to potentially reconstitute the ion pair (Arg-30-->Glu, Glu-350-->Arg) failed to restore the wild-type half-life. Circular dichroism spectra analysis indicated that the active and latent forms of wtPAI-1 and all four mutants contained similar secondary structural elements. Thermal stability determinations showed that latent wtPAI-1 was much more structurally stable than the active conformation. However, the latent form for all four mutants was significantly less stable than the corresponding wtPAI-1 conformer. This is the first report of PAI-1 mutants which have been specifically engineered to produce enhanced functional stability.",

In the present study, spectroscopic methods have been employed to investigate the effects of deglycosylation (via endoglycosidase F treatment) and complexation with lipid on the stability and conformation of this protein. Addition of isolated lipid-free apoLp-III to sonicated vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) resulted in the formation of relatively uniform disklike complexes with an average Strokes diameter of 13.5 nm. Flotation equilibrium experiments conducted in the analytical ultracentrifuge revealed a particle molecular mass of 588 500 Da. Chemical cross-linking and compositional analysis of apoLp-III.DMPC complexes indicated five apoLp-III molecules per disk and an overall DMPC:apoLp-III molar ratio of 122:1. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of apoLp-III samples suggested a loss of alpha-helical structure upon deglycosylation, while complexation with DMPC did not significantly alter the helix content (estimated to be > 75%). Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the apoLp-III tryptophan fluorescence emission maximum was blue-shifted from 347 to 332 and 321 nm upon deglycosylation and complexation with DMPC, respectively. In quenching experiments with native apoLp-III, tryptophan residues were shielded from the positively charged quencher, CsCl. Increased exposure to KI, CsCl, and acrylamide was observed upon deglycosylation, whereas complexation with DMPC yielded lower Ksv values for KI and acrylamide and an increased value for CsCl versus native lipid-free apoLp-III. In guanidine hydrochloride denaturation studies monitored by CD or fluorescence, native, lipid-free apoLp-III displayed a denaturation midpoint of 0.60 M, and delta GDH2O = 5.37 kcal/mol was calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "It is our aim to elucidate molecular aspects of the mechanism of protein folding. We use ribonuclease T1 as a model protein, because it is a small single-domain protein with a well-defined secondary and tertiary structure, which is stable in the presence and absence of disulfide bonds. Also, an efficient mutagenesis system is available to produce protein molecules with defined sequence variations. Here we present a preliminary characterization of the folding kinetics of ribonuclease T1. Its unfolding and refolding reactions are reversible, which is shown by the quantitative recovery of the catalytic activity after an unfolding/refolding cycle. Refolding is a complex process, where native protein is formed on three distinguishable pathways. There are 3.5% fast-folding molecules, which refold within the millisecond time range, and 96.5% slow-folding species, which regain the native state in the time range of minutes to hours. These slow-folding molecules give rise to two major, parallel refolding reactions. The mixture of fast- and slow-folding molecules is produced slowly after unfolding by chain equilibration reactions that show properties of proline isomerization. We conclude that part of the kinetic complexity of RNase T1 folding can be explained on the basis of the proline model for protein folding. This is supported by the finding that the slow refolding reactions of this protein are accelerated in the presence of the enzyme prolyl isomerase. However, several properties of ribonuclease T1 refolding, such as the dependence of the relative amplitudes on the probes, used to follow folding, are not readily explained by a simple proline model.",

Both the equilibrium unfolding transition and the folding kinetics are perfectly described by a N<-->U two-state model. The validity of this model was confirmed by several kinetic tests.

In this article, we characterize the folding free energy landscape of SGPB and compare it to the folding landscapes of alphaLP and trypsin, a mammalian homolog that folds independently of its zymogen peptide. In contrast to the thermodynamically stable native state of trypsin, SGPB and alphaLP fold to native states that are thermodynamically marginally stable or unstable, respectively. Instead, their apparent stability arises kinetically, from unfolding free energy barriers that are both large and highly cooperative. The unique unfolding transitions of SGPB and alphaLP extend their functional lifetimes under highly degradatory conditions beyond that seen for trypsin; however, the penalty for evolving kinetic stability is remarkably large in that each factor of 2.4-8 in protease resistance is accompanied by a cost of ~10(5) in the spontaneous folding rate and ~5-9 kcal/mole in thermodynamic stability. These penalties have been overcome by the coevolution of increasingly effective pro regions to facilitate folding. Despite these costs, kinetic stability appears to be a potent mechanism for developing native-state properties that maximize protease longevity.",

Application of the double-mutant cycle analysis gives an interaction energy of -1.3 kcal/mol for the aromatic pair in the folded protein relative to solvation by water in the unfolded protein. This value is similar to that calculated from the change in surface-accessible area between the rings on the formation of the pair. Analysis of a further double-mutant cycle in which the Tyr residues are mutated to Phe indicates that the aromatic-aromatic interactions of Tyr/Tyr and Phe/Phe make identical contributions to protein stability. However, Tyr is preferred to Phe by 0.3(+/- 0.04) kcal/mol at the solvent-exposed face of the alpha-helix.",

Surprisingly, none of the standard set of explanations for residue conservation applies. The proline residues are not apparently conserved for function, or stability, or to nucleate folding, or to promote stabilising interactions across domain boundaries. However, when the most highly conserved proline residues are mutated to alanine there is an increase in the rate of aggregation of a fnIII double-module construct. The results suggest that proline residues may be conserved at domain-domain boundaries in fnIII domains to prevent aggregation in multi-modular proteins.",

        "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study the thermal unfolding of hevein, a 43-residue disulfide-rich protein whose three-dimensional structure has been determined by X-ray diffraction. In the range pH 2.0-3.7 this process was approximately 75% reversible as judged by repeated scans on the same sample. The ratios of van'tr Hoff to calorimetric enthalpies were considerably larger than one, suggesting that intermolecular cooperation is involved in the unfolding of this protein. Alternatively, it is possible that the partial irreversibility of this process may cause distortions of the endotherm that affect the calculation of the van't Hoff enthalpy. Experimental changes in heat capacity and enthalpy were compared with those calculated from polar and nonpolar surface areas buried in the native state. It was found that when the unfolded state is represented as an extended chain without disulfide cross-links, experimental and calculated parameters agree well. However, if the unfolded protein is modeled with the presence of disulfide bridges, the agreement between the two sets of parameters is lost. The entropy change/residue at 112 degrees C is considerably smaller than the average value for globular proteins, thus suggesting that, as expected, disulfide bonds strongly influence the entropy of the unfolded state of this protein.",

In order to understand why serpins attain the native state instead of more stable conformations we have begun investigations into the equilibrium-unfolding of alpha(1)-antitrypsin. alpha(1)-Antitrypsin contains two tryptophan residues, Trp194 and Trp238, situated on the A and B beta-sheets, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct two single-tryptophan variants. Both variants were fully active and had similar secondary structure and stabilities to alpha(1)-antitrypsin. The denaturation of alpha(1)-antitrypsin and its variants was extremely similar when followed by far-UV CD, indicating the presence of a single intermediate. Fluorescence analysis of the unfolding behavior of each single tryptophan variant indicated that the sole tryptophan residue reported the structural changes within its immediate environment. These data suggest that the A beta-sheet is expanded in the intermediate state whilst no structural change around the B beta-sheet has occurred. In the urea-induced unfolded state, Trp238 does not become fully solvated, suggesting the persistence of structure around this residue. The implications of these data on the folding, misfolding and function of the serpin superfamily are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding and refolding processes of Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI at 25 degrees C, induced by concentration jumps of either guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) or urea, were investigated using stopped-flow circular dichroism (CD), stopped-flow fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopies. Only a single exponential process was detected for the fast time scale unfolding (rate constants from 0.014 to 0.54 s-1, depending on the final denaturant concentration). For refolding, the far-UV CD value largely recovered within 50 ms of the stopped-flow mixing dead time (burst phase). This phase was followed by either one or two phases, with rate constants from 0.035 to 2.45 s-1 as detected by CD and fluorescence, respectively. Although this protein has a single cis-Pro residue, a very slow phase due to proline isomerization was not observed, for either unfolding or refolding. The difference in the amplitudes of the burst phases for refolding in the far- and near-UV CD spectra revealed that an intermediate state exists, with the characteristics of a molten globule. Because the one-phased fast exponential process detected by CD corresponds to the slower of the two phases detected by fluorescence, the intermediate detected by CD might be the most stable. GuHCl denaturation experiments revealed that this intermediate cooperatively unfolds, with a transition midpoint of 1.33 +/- 0.03 M. The Gibbs free energy difference (delta G) between the intermediate and the unfolded states, under physiological conditions (25 degrees C, pH 5.5, and 0 M GuHCl), was estimated to be 20.0 +/- 2.3 kJ mol-1. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the refolding intermediate, rather than the unfolded state, is the latent denatured state under physiological conditions. Approximately linear relationships between the GuHCl concentration and the logarithm of the microscopic rate constants determined by CD and fluorescence were also observed. By extrapolation to a GuHCl concentration of 0 M, activation Gibbs free energies of 98.5 +/- 1.1 kJ mol-1 for unfolding and 69.5 +/- 0.2 kJ mol-1 for refolding under physiological conditions were obtained. The hydrogen-exchange-refolding competition combined with two-dimensional NMR revealed that the amide protons of alpha-helix I are the most highly protected, suggesting that alpha-helix I is the initial site of protein folding. The CD and NMR data showed that the intermediate state has a structure similar to that of the acid-denatured molten globule.",

        "abstract": "To understand the role of non-Gly residues in the left-handed helical conformation for the conformational stability of a protein, the non-Gly to Gly and Ala mutations at six left-handed residues (R21, Y38, R50, Q58, H78, and N118) of the human lysozyme were examined. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter, and the crystal structures were analyzed by X-ray crystallography. If a left-handed non-Gly had an unfavorable steric interaction between the side-chain Cbeta and backbone, the Gly mutation would be expected to stabilize more than the Ala mutation at the same position. For the mutant human lysozymes, however, there were few differences in the denaturation Gibbs energy (DeltaG) between the Gly and Ala mutants, except for the substitution at position 58. Analysis of the changes in stability (DeltaDeltaG) based on the structures of the wild-type and mutant proteins showed that the experimental DeltaDeltaG value of Q58G was approximately 7 kJ/mol higher than the estimated value without consideration of any local steric interaction. These results indicate that only Q58G increased the stability by elimination of local constraints. The residue 58 is located at the most rigid position in the left-handed non-Gly residues and is involved in its enzymatic function. It can be concluded that the left-handed non-Gly residues do not always have unfavorable strain energies as compared with Gly at the same position.",

In many cases, these structural perturbations are essential to function, and they are the result of complex networks of interactions. Here we used cytochrome b(5), a protein that undergoes extensive structural rearrangement upon heme binding, to seek a relationship between affinity for the cofactor and extent of refolding induced by its binding. Three variants of the water-soluble domain of the rat microsomal protein were chosen to affect the stability of the apoprotein or the holoprotein. Sequence alterations were introduced in the heme binding loop (type I mutations, D60R and (55)TENFED --> (55)TEPFEED, or PE), which is largely unstructured in the apoprotein state, and in the folded core of the apoprotein (type II mutation, P81A). Thermal and chemical denaturation experiments and heme transfer experiments were performed on these proteins. Type I mutations left the thermodynamic stability of the apoprotein unchanged. The first mutation (D60R) stabilized the holoprotein in a probable manifestation of enhanced helical propensity or improved electrostatic interactions. The second mutation (PE) decreased heme affinity and holoprotein stability in concert. For this protein, heme transfer experiments could be used to estimate the rate constant of heme loss from each of the heme orientational isomers. In contrast, the type II mutation resulted in a marked destabilization of the apoprotein but an intermediate effect on the holoprotein stability and heme affinity. These data supported that heme affinity could be modulated by the apoprotein stability and by specific residues remote from the heme binding site.",

Assuming a two-state transition model, the dependence of Gibbs free-energy change of unfolding on the denaturant concentration was calculated. Under applied hydrostatic pressure, these data were interpreted as suggesting that a two-state model is not applicable in a restricted temperature range; the dominant effect of hydrostatic pressure is to affect the cooperativity in protein unfolding due to a chemical equilibrium shift in the direction of the reduction in the system volume. The deviation from the two-state transition model appears to be rationalized by assuming that applied pressure induces an intermediate conformation between the native and unfolded states of the protein. The implication of the thermodynamic stability of protein under pressure was discussed.",

        "abstract": "Disulfides cross-link residues in a protein that are separated in primary sequence and stabilize the protein through entropic destabilization of the unfolded state. While the removal of naturally occurring disulfides leads to protein destabilization, introduction of engineered disulfides does not always lead to significant stabilization of a protein. We have analyzed naturally occurring disulfides that span adjacent antiparallel strands of beta sheets (cross-strand disulfides). Cross-strand disulfides have recently been implicated as redox-based conformational switches in proteins such as gp120 and CD4. The propensity of these disulfides to act as conformational switches was postulated on the basis of the hypothesis that this class of disulfide is conformationally strained. In the present analysis, there was no evidence to suggest that cross-strand disulfides are more strained compared to other disulfides as assessed by their torsional energy. It was also observed that these disulfides occur solely at non-hydrogen-bonded (NHB) registered pairs of adjacent antiparallel strands and not at hydrogen-bonded (HB) positions as suggested previously. One of the half-cystines involved in cross-strand disulfide formation often occurs at an edge strand. Experimental confirmation of the stabilizing effects of such disulfides was carried out in Escherichia coli thioredoxin. Four pairs of cross-strand cysteines were introduced, two at HB and two at NHB pairs. Disulfides were formed in all four cases. However, as predicted from our analysis, disulfides at NHB positions resulted in an increase in melting temperature of 7-10 degrees C, while at HB positions there was a corresponding decrease of -7 degrees C. The reduced state of all proteins had similar stability.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding of human serum albumin (HSA), a multidomain protein, by urea was followed by far-UV circular dichroism (CD), intrinsic fluorescence, and ANS fluorescence measurements. The urea-induced transition, which otherwise was a two-step process with a stable intermediate at around 4.8 M urea concentration as monitored by far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence, underwent a single-step cooperative transition in the presence of 1.0 M KCl. The free energy of stabilization (DeltaDelta G(H2O)D) in the presence of 1 M KCl was found to be 1,090 and 1,200 cal/mol as determined by CD and fluorescence, respectively. The salt stabilization occurred in the first transition (0-5.0 M urea), which corresponded to the formation of intermediate (I) state from the native (N) state, whereas the second transition, corresponding to the unfolding of I state to denatured (D) state, remained unaffected. Urea denaturation of HSA as monitored by tryptophan fluorescence of the lone tryptophan residue (Trp(214)) residing in domain II of the protein, followed a single-step transition suggesting that domain(s) I and/or III is (are) involved in the intermediate formation. This was also confirmed by the acrylamide quenching of tryptophan fluorescence at 5 M urea, which exhibited little change in the value of Stern-Volmer constant. ANS fluorescence data also showed single-step transition reflecting the absence of accumulation of hydrophobic patches. The stabilizing potential of various salts studied by far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence was found to follow the order: NaClO(4) > NaSCN >Na(2)SO(4) >KBr >KCl >KF. A comparison of the effects of various potassium salts revealed that anions were chiefly responsible in stabilizing HSA. The above series was found similar to the electroselectivity series of anions towards the anion-exchange resins and reverse of the Hofmeister series, suggesting that preferential binding of anions to HSA rather than hydration, was primarily responsible for stabilization. Further, single-step transition observed with GdnHCl can be ascribed to its ionic character as the free energy change associated with urea denaturation in the presence of 1.0 M KCl (5,980 cal/mol) was similar to that obtained with GdnHCl (5,870 cal/mol).",

        "abstract": "The unfolding and refolding transitions of French bean apoplastocyanin (apo-Pc), a beta-sandwich protein, have been characterized. The apoprotein is stabilized by sodium sulfate and can be reversibly unfolded by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl). However, in contrast to holo-Pc, apo-Pc is unstable at low ionic strength, suggesting that the copper ion stabilizes the holoprotein. The equilibrium unfolding transition monitored by peptide circular dichroism (CD) and tyrosine fluorescence is described by a two-state model. The kinetics of the unfolding transition were monitored using a manual mixing technique and are consistent with a single two-state transition. In contrast, the kinetics of the refolding reaction measured by fluorescence and CD show two transitions with different rates. The relaxation time of the slower phase (800-1000 s) is almost independent of GuHCl concentration. The faster phase was observed only under strongly native conditions, and its relaxation time is GuHCl-dependent. Double-jump experiments and acceleration by cyclophilin demonstrate that both phases involve cis-trans isomerization of proline residues. The changes in fluorescence associated with the two phases are more than 150% of the total change expected from equilibrium experiments, indicating the presence of intermediate(s) with fluorescence greater than the unfolded state. Amide hydrogen-exchange experiments coupled with two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy demonstrate the formation of an intermediate in the very low refolding reaction in which amide protons in the beta-sheets are weakly protected from exchange. No CD evidence for nativelike beta-sheet formation was found for this intermediate. The NMR experiments suggest that the intermediate is compact with flexible beta-sheets and altered packing of the hydrophobic core. It has many of the characteristics of a molten globule. However, the 1H NMR spectrum of the intermediate exhibits a small number of shifted resonances that indicate the presence of specific tertiary interactions in a localized region. A mechanism for refolding of apoplastocyanin is proposed that includes two slow steps corresponding to trans-->cis isomerization of two prolines.",

As judged by circular dichroism, UV absorbance, fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the permutation causes little change in the structure of the protein. Reversible denaturation experiments show that the permutation reduces the stability of T4 lysozyme only 0.8-1.1 kcal/mol. These results demonstrate that a protein with two domains can be permuted with little change in activity, structure, and stability.

The refolding and unfolding kinetics of a chimera, in which the amino acid sequence of residues 1 to 34 was from human alpha-lactalbumin and the remainder of the sequence from bovine alpha-lactalbumin, were studied by stopped-flow tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. The chimeric protein refolded and unfolded substantially faster than bovine alpha-lactalbumin. The stability of the molten globule state formed by the chimera was greater than that of bovine alpha-lactalbumin, and the hydrophobic surface area buried inside of the molecule in the molten globule state was increased by the substitution of residues 1 to 34. Peptide fragments corresponding to the A- and B-helix of the chimera showed higher helix propensity than those of the bovine protein, indicating the contribution of local interactions to the high stability of the molten globule state of the chimera. Moreover, the substitution of residues 1-34 decreased the free energy level of the transition state and increased hydrophobic surface area buried inside of the molecule in the transition state. Our results indicate that local interactions as well as hydrophobic interactions formed in the molten globule state are important in guiding the subsequent structural formation of alpha-lactalbumin.",

J., and Clarke, A. R. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 5786-5794]. The residue changes were chemically conservative, each representing the removal of one or two methylene groups from aliphatic side chains. Predictably, the mutations destabilize the folded state with respect to the unfolded state by about 1.1 +/- 0.7 kcal mol-1 per methylene group removed. However, when the folding reaction is dissected by transient kinetic analysis into its component steps, six out of the nine mutations lead to a stabilization of the I-state. The direction and magnitude of these effects on the global stability of the transient intermediate are well correlated with changes in secondary structure propensity occasioned by the substitutions. The results show that, although side chain interactions are extremely weak in this early phase of folding, the beta-strand conformation of the polypeptide chain is established. In the next phase of the reaction, the rate-limiting transition state is attained by the formation of a tightly localized hydrophobic nucleus which includes residues V30, I18, and V78.

A subtilisin variant containing cysteine residues at positions 22 and 87 was created by site-directed mutagenesis and was shown to have an activity essentially equivalent to that of the wild-type enzyme. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments demonstrated the variant protein to have a melting temperature 3.1 degrees C higher than that of the wild-type protein and 5.8 degrees C higher than that of the reduced form (-SH HS-) of the variant protein. Kinetic experiments performed under a variety of conditions, including 8 M urea, showed that the Cys-22/Cys-87 disulfide variant undergoes thermal inactivation at half the rate of that of the wild-type enzyme. The increased thermal stability of this disulfide variant is consistent with a decrease in entropy for the unfolded state relative to the unfolded state that contains no cross-link, as would be predicted from the statistical thermodynamics of polymers.",

        "abstract": "Ribonuclease P2 from the thermophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus is a small protein (7 kDa) with a known three-dimensional structure. Inspection of the structure and molecular dynamics simulation reveal that three aromatic residues (Phe5, Phe31, and Tyr33) from the hydrophobic core have a strong van der Waals interaction energy. We studied the thermodynamics of the heat, cold, and pressure-induced protein conformational changes of the wild type and of the F31A and F31Y mutants by analyzing the protein UV absorbance in the fourth derivative mode. The wild-type protein was extremely stable under all conditions of temperature and pressure. Heat and cold denaturation of both mutants, as well as denaturation by pressure of the F31A mutant, led to significant blue shifts of the derivative spectrum, indicating increased solvent exposure of Tyr33. For the F31Y mutant, high pressure (400 MPa) protected the protein against thermal denaturation. This study, probing the properties of the hydrophobic aromatic core, complements a thermal unfolding study which probes the overall structural changes [Knapp, S., Karshikoff, A., Berndt, K. D., Christova, P., Atanasov, B., & Ladenstein, R. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 264,1132-1144]. The differences observed in response to extremes of temperature, pressure, and pH may be rationalized by an unfolding mechanism involving larger parts of the peripheral protein while the integrity of the hydrophobic core is maintained.",

We measured the shortening of six intra-protein distances during folding by F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in combination with stopped-flow experiments. Single tryptophan residues were engineered into the protein as the donors, and single 5-(((acetylamino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonate (AEDANS) residues were placed as the acceptors at solvent-exposed sites of Bc-Csp. Their R0 value of about 22 A was well suited for following distance changes during the folding of this protein with a high sensitivity. The mutagenesis and the labeling did not alter the refolding kinetics. The changes in energy transfer during folding were monitored by both donor and acceptor emission and reciprocal effects were found. In two cases the donor-acceptor distances were similar in the unfolded and the folded state and, as a consequence, the kinetic changes in energy transfer upon folding were very small. For four donor/acceptor pairs we found that > or =50% of the increase in energy transfer upon folding occurred prior to the rate-limiting step of folding. This reveals that about half of the shortening of the intra-molecular distances upon folding has occurred already before the rate-limiting step and suggests that the fast two-state folding reaction of Bc-Csp is preceded by a very rapid collapse.",

In the present study, the irreversible thermoinactivation of savinase has been evaluated at 70 degrees C, and various possible mechanisms for irreversible thermoinactivation of savinase were examined.

To improve the thermal stability of the enzyme, the effect of two co-solvents (sorbitol and trehalose) on the enzyme's activity and stability was investigated. Both osmolytes prevented the autolysis of savinase at 70 degrees C without inactivating the enzyme; furthermore, the structural and kinetic stabilities of the enzyme increased in the presence of additives.",

To investigate the potential contribution of the extra dimer-dimer interface in CaMDH with respect to thermal stability, we have engineered an intersubunit disulfide bridge designed to strengthen dimer-dimer interactions. The resulting mutant (T187C, containing two 187-187 disulfide bridges in the tetramer) showed a 200-fold increase in half-life at 75 degrees C and an increase of 15 deg. C in apparent melting temperature compared to the wild-type. The crystal structure of the mutant (solved at 1.75 A resolution) was essentially identical with that of the wild-type, with the exception of the added inter-dimer disulfide bridge and the loss of an aromatic intra-dimer contact. Remarkably, the mutant and the wild-type had similar temperature optima and activities at their temperature optima, thus providing a clear case of uncoupling of thermal stability and thermoactivity. The results show that tetramerization may contribute to MDH stability to an extent that depends strongly on the number of stabilizing interactions in the dimer-dimer interface.",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical studies on the folding of protein G B1 domain have shown that the C-terminal fragment (C16) has a considerable amount of beta-hairpin structure that exchanges between the folded and unfolded states at room temperature, and that the C16 fragment binds noncovalently to an N-terminal fragment (N40) under physiological conditions. Those studies have led us to the hypothesis that the amphipathic beta-hairpin structure of C16 initiates folding of the domain. To obtain a more detailed understanding of the folding mechanism of the domain, we designed a mutant of C16 (SS16ox) with a disulfide bond between residues 41 and 56, and then examined the interaction of the mutant with N40 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and by thermal denaturation studies using circular dichroism. SS16ox strongly interacted with N40, with an equilibrium constant, KD, that was 7-fold higher than wild-type. The association rate constant, kon, of SS16ox was 8.7-fold higher than that of wild-type. This strong interaction can be explained by the entropic effect of the disulfide bond. The introduction of the disulfide bond into C16 stabilizes the beta-hairpin structure of C16, accelerates the association rate with N40, and then stabilizes the whole complex. These results support a hypothetical folding mechanism of protein G where the amphipathic beta-hairpin structure of C16 acts as a nucleus and accelerates folding of the whole molecule.",

        "abstract": "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are caused by a unique infectious agent which appears to be identical with PrPSc, an oligomeric, misfolded isoform of the cellular prion protein, PrPC. All inherited forms of human TSEs, i.e., familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia, segregate with specific point mutations or insertions in the gene coding for human PrP. Here we have tested the hypothesis that these mutations destabilize PrPC and thus facilitate its conversion into PrPSc. Eight of the disease-specific amino acid replacements are located in the C-terminal domain of PrPC, PrP(121-231), which constitutes the only part of PrPC with a defined tertiary structure. Introduction of all these replacements into PrP(121-231) yielded variants with the same spectroscopic characteristics as wild-type PrP(121-231) and similar to full-length PrP(23-231), which excludes the possibility that the exchanges a priori induce a PrPSc-like conformation. The thermodynamic stabilities of the variants do not correlate with specific disease phenotypes. Five of the amino acid replacements destabilize PrP(121-231), but the other variants have the same stability as the wild-type protein. These data suggest that destabilization of PrPC is neither a general mechanism underlying the formation of PrPSc nor the basis of disease phenotypes in inherited human TSEs.",

Judging from their circular dichroic and fluorescence spectra, these modified proteins were found to be the same as those of the respective intact proteins. However, even the slight modification of a single tryptophan residue produced a large decrease in the stability of these proteins to guanidine hydrochloride and heat. The smaller the extent of exposure of the tryptophan residue, the greater the effect of the modification on the stability. The formal kinetic mechanism of unfolding and refolding by guanidine hydrochloride of the CL fragment was not altered by tryptophan oxidation, but the rate constants for unfolding and refolding changed. The thermal unfolding transitions were analyzed to obtain the thermodynamic parameters. The enthalpy and entropy changes for the modified proteins were larger than the respective values for the intact proteins.",

        "abstract": "The p16 protein has been identified as a tumor suppressor that functions by inhibiting the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. Deletions or point mutations in the p16 gene have been found in a number cancers, emphasizing its importance in regulating cell cycle progression. Inhibition by p16 occurs through protein-protein interactions with its targets. This is not surprising, since p16 is thought to contain ankyrin-like repeats, motifs implicated in protein-protein interactions. Our goal was to identify structural characteristics of p16 not only as an important step towards understanding CDK4 inhibition but also to explore the role of ankyrin repeats in the p16 structure, as no detailed structure of any protein containing these motifs has been reported. We have expressed, refolded, and purified p16 from E. coli and have shown it to be functionally active by specific binding to CDK4. Analytical ultracentrifugation has shown that p16 weakly self-associates to form dimers with a Kd = 270 microM. The CD spectrum indicates that the protein is composed of 33% alpha-helix, 22% beta-sheet, 19% beta-turn, and 27% other (which includes aromatic and random coil contributions). Further CD experiments suggest that p16 exhibits low structural stability with a delta G of -2.3 kcal/mol. This weak stability is a consequence of a highly dynamic structure as measured by ANS-binding, NMR hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and fluorescence. It is possible that a well-defined tertiary structure is imparted upon the binding of p16 to CDK4.",

        "abstract": "We have developed and experimentally tested a novel computational approach for the de novo design of hydrophobic cores. A pair of computer programs has been written, the first of which creates a \"custom\" rotamer library for potential hydrophobic residues, based on the backbone structure of the protein of interest. The second program uses a genetic algorithm to globally optimize for a low energy core sequence and structure, using the custom rotamer library as input. Success of the programs in predicting the sequences of native proteins indicates that they should be effective tools for protein design. Using these programs, we have designed and engineered several variants of the phage 434 cro protein, containing five, seven, or eight sequence changes in the hydrophobic core. As controls, we have produced a variant consisting of a randomly generated core with six sequence changes but equal volume relative to the native core and a variant with a \"minimalist\" core containing predominantly leucine residues. Two of the designs, including one with eight core sequence changes, have thermal stabilities comparable to the native protein, whereas the third design and the minimalist protein are significantly destabilized. The randomly designed control is completely unfolded under equivalent conditions. These results suggest that rational de novo design of hydrophobic cores is feasible, and stress the importance of specific packing interactions for the stability of proteins. A surprising aspect of the results is that all of the variants display highly cooperative thermal denaturation curves and reasonably dispersed NMR spectra. This suggests that the non-core residues of a protein play a significant role in determining the uniqueness of the folded structure.",

To clarify the molecular features of C77/95A and the reason for its increased secretion in yeast, the stabilities of the mutant C77/95A and the wild-type proteins were examined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation, and the unfolding-refolding kinetics were determined from circular dichroism and fluorescence stopped-flow measurements. Equilibrium experiments showed that the delta G of unfolding of C77/95A in water was 5.8 kcal/mol less stable than that of the wild-type protein at pH 4.0 and 10 degrees C. The unfolding rate of C77/95A was 4 orders of magnitude faster than that of the wild-type protein whereas the two proteins shared similar refolding rates. The slowly refolding phase of the wild-type protein disappeared in C77/95A, indicating that the disulfide bond affects this phase. These observations show that the disulfide bond Cys77-Cys95 contributes to the stabilization of the folded form of human lysozyme by suppressing the unfolding rate and that the increase in the unfolding rate, or the disappearance of the slowly refolding phase in vitro, could correlate with the increase in secretion efficiency in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Many of the interactions that stabilize proteins are co-operative and cannot be reduced to a sum of pairwise interactions. Such interactions may be analysed by protein engineering methods using multiple thermodynamic cycles comprising wild-type protein and all combinations of mutants in the interacting residues. There is a triad of charged residues on the surface of barnase, comprising residues Asp8, Asp12 and Arg110, that interact by forming two exposed salt bridges. The three residues have been mutated to alanine to give all the single, double and triple mutants. The free energies of unfolding of wild-type and the seven mutant proteins have been determined and the results analysed to give the contributions of the residues in the two salt bridges to protein stability. It is possible to isolate the energies of forming the salt bridges relative to the solvation of the separated ions by water. In the intact triad, the apparent contribution to the stabilization energy of the protein of the salt bridge between Asp12 and Arg110 is -1.25 kcal mol-1, whereas that of the salt bridge between Asp8 with Arg110 is -0.98 kcal mol-1. The strengths of the two salt bridges are coupled: the energy of each is reduced by 0.77 kcal mol-1 when the other is absent. The salt-linked triad, relative to alanine residues at the same positions, does not contribute to the stability of the protein since the favourable interactions of the salt bridges are more than offset by other electrostatic and non-electrostatic energy terms. Salt-linked triads occur in other proteins, for example, haemoglobin, where the energy of only the salt-bridge term is important and so the coupling of salt bridges could be of general importance to the stability and function of proteins.",

        "abstract": "DsbA is a periplasmic protein of Escherichia coli that was identified genetically as being involved in the formation of disulfide bonds in secreted proteins. Its active site contains one accessible and one buried cysteine residue, separated in the primary structure by only two other residues. These cysteine residues can form a very unstable disulfide bond that is 10(3)-fold more reactive toward thiols than normal. Moreover, the mixed disulfide between the accessible cysteine residue and glutathione is 10(4)-fold more reactive than normal. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to replace either one or both cysteine residues by serine. Cys30 is shown to be the accessible thiol, while Cys33 is shielded from the solvent. Even though the thiol group of Cys30 is exposed and reactive, it formed a very unstable mixed disulfide with glutathione. This disulfide bond was 2.17 +/- 0.02 kcal mol-1 less stable in the native conformation than when DsbA was unfolded. If the native conformation destabilizes the mixed disulfide, the mixed disulfide must destabilize the folded conformation to the same extent. This was confirmed by demonstrating that the folded conformation of the mixed disulfide form of the mutant DsbA was 2.7 +/- 0.9 kcal mol-1 less stable than that of the reduced form; these stability effects originated almost exclusively in the folded conformation. Replacing the cysteine residues by serine destabilized the folded conformation of the reduced protein to varying extents. This suggests that the thiol groups are involved in interactions that stabilize the folded conformation, which would cause any disulfide bonds, either inter- or intramolecular, that involve these groups to be unstable.",

        "abstract": "The temperature dependence of the heat capacity function of holo and apo alpha-lactalbumin has been studied by high sensitivity differential scanning microcalorimetry. The heat capacities of the holo and apo forms in the native state were found to be close to, but somewhat higher than, that of lysozyme, which has a similar structure. At pH values higher than 5, the heat-denatured state and the unfolded state are indistinguishable. At lower pH values, the heat capacity of the state obtained by heat or acid denaturation is lower than what is expected for the completely unfolded polypeptide chain, but it approaches that value at higher temperatures. The heat capacity increment of the denatured state correlates well with the amount of residual structure measured by ellipticity (i.e., the lower the residual structure, the higher the heat capacity). The extent of residual structure in the denatured state, which is exceptionally high in alpha-lactalbumin, decreases upon increasing temperature and at approximately 110 degrees C becomes close to that observed in 6 M GdmCl. Above 110 degrees C, the denatured state of alpha-lactalbumin is practically indistinguishable in heat capacity and ellipticity from the fully unfolded state. The calorimetric data have been analyzed quantitatively using a statistically thermodynamic formalism. This analysis indicates that the long-range or global cooperativity of the protein is lost after heat denaturation of the native state, causing the remaining elements of residual structure to behave in a more or less independent fashion. At pH values close to neutral, heat denaturation occurs at high temperature and yields a totally unfolded polypeptide with no measurable population of partly folded intermediates. At lower pH values, denaturation occurs at lower temperatures and a progressively higher population of intermediates is observed. At pH 4.2, about 50% of the molecules is in compact intermediate states immediately after heat denaturation; however, at pH 3.5, this percentage is close to 80% and at pH 3.0 it reaches about 100% of the protein molecules. Upon heating, the unfolded state progressively becomes the predominant species. The analysis of the heat capacity data for alpha-lactalbumin indicates that the best model to account for the observed behavior is one in which the denatured state is represented as a distribution of substates with varying degrees of residual structure. At low temperatures, the distribution is centered around rather compact substates with significant residual structure. At higher temperatures, the distribution shifts toward states with less residual structure and eventually to the completely unfolded state.",

        "abstract": "Human serum transferrin and hen ovotransferrin have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), in an effort to quantitatively estimate the free energy of interaction of the N- and C-domains in each protein and to further understand their interaction with chelated ferric ions. In the case of serum transferrin, separate DSC transitions are observed for the two domains while only a single, coupled transition is seen for ovotransferrin. Although domain interactions are somewhat larger for ovotransferrin (-4100 cal/mol) than for serum transferrin (-3100 cal/mol), the major cause of separated transitions for serum transferrin is that the difference in intrinsic folding stability of the N- and C-domains is about 4-fold larger than for ovotransferrin. Chelated ferric ions bind strongly to each site in both proteins and produce changes in Tm by as much as 30 degrees C. When apparent binding constants are estimated from DSC results, these appear to be substantially larger than those estimated previously from equilibrium methods at low temperatures, where very long equilibrium times must be used because of slow ligand release. Although second DSC upscans on each protein show good \"reversibility\", downscans on serum transferrin revealed that liganded forms of the protein are in fact not in true equilibrium during upscanning, which causes Tm values during upscans to be higher than the true reversible Tm values. The likely reason for this kinetic control over unfolding is the slow release of bound ferric ions and those effects, for technical reasons, cannot be totally eliminated by lowering the scan rate.",

        "abstract": "From the systematic replacements of amino acid residues of Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI with those of its thermophilic counterpart, the basic protrusion domain including region 6 (R6) from residues 91 to 95 was found to increase the structural stability of the mutant protein (Kimura, S., Nakamura, H., Hashimoto, T., Oobatake, M., and Kanaya, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21535-21542). Further mutagenesis concentrating in the R6 region has revealed that replacements of Lys95 at the left-handed structure with Gly or Asn essentially enhances the protein stability. Gly and Asn substitutions stabilize the protein up to 1.9 kcal/mol and 0.9 kcal/mol in the free energy changes of unfolding, respectively. We propose that the amino acid substitution of left-handed non-Gly residue with Gly or Asn residue can be used as one of the general strategies to enhance protein stability, when such a non-Gly residue itself does not seriously contribute to protein stability.",

No change in conformation or stability was observed on removal of three residues from the C-terminal end. Removal of seven or more residues from the C-terminal end destabilized the CL fragment. The rate of disulfide bond formation from reduced CL(109-207) was about 7 times faster than that for CL(109-214).

Wild-type R17 folds in a two-state manner and the chevron plot (plot of the logarithm of the observed rate constant against concentration of urea) shows essentially linear folding and unfolding arms. A number of mutant proteins, however, show a change in slope of the unfolding arm at high concentration of denaturant, hinting at complexity in the folding landscape. Through a combination of mutational studies and high temperature molecular dynamics simulations we show that the folding of R17 can be described by a model with two sequential transition states separated by an intermediate species. The rate limiting transition state for folding in water has been characterized both through experimental Phi-value analysis and by simulation. In contrast, a detailed analysis of the transition state predicted to dominate under highly denaturing conditions is only possible by simulation.",

        "abstract": "New classes of small proteins have recently been found that refold rapidly with two-state kinetics from a substantially unfolded conformation (\"U\") and without the accumulation of a folding intermediate. Barnase, on the other hand, is representative of a class of proteins that display multistate kinetics and refold from a partly structured conformation, a folding intermediate (I). The accumulation of I on the folding pathway of barnase is highly dependent on the experimental conditions: a transition from multistate to two-state folding behavior can be induced simply by changing the reaction conditions away from physiological, i.e., elevated temperatures, high concentration of denaturant, or low pH. We argue that the change in folding behavior results from the denatured state changing under different conditions. The denatured state seems compact and partly structured at conditions that favor folding but is disorganized at denaturing conditions. At physiological pH and temperature, the denatured state (Dphys) is the folding intermediate because it is the most stable of the denatured conformation, i.e., Dphys is identical to I. At high temperature or [urea], however, Dphys becomes destabilized relative to less structured denatured states (\"U\"). Kinetics under these extreme conditions is two-state because the refolding reaction is from \"U\" to the native state with no significant accumulation of Dphys (identical to I) which is here a high-energy intermediate. The two-state behavior at low pH results from a different cause. The acid-denatured state of barnase (Dacid) is not as unfolded as \"U\" but energetically similar to Dphys (identical to I). It appears that protonation of Dphys has only marginal effects on its stability, so that the protonated form of Dphys constitutes the acid-denatured state at equilibrium. The energetic similarity between Dphys and Dacid gives rise to two-state kinetics at low pH, although the refolding is from a compact denatured state throughout the pH range. Protonation of Dphys to give Dacid causes the structure to become more disorganized and hydrated. The heat capacity of Dphys (identical to I) at pH 6.3 is in between that of \"U\" and the native protein. We suggest that protonation of folding intermediates disrupts their structural integrity and allows isoenergetic reorganizations that increase the solvation of charged residues. Such protonated and reorganized folding intermediates may then constitute the molten globules, which are compact denatured states that are sometimes observed at equilibrium at low pH and high ionic strength. Under all experimental conditions, the heat capacity of the major transition state is close to that of the native protein. This, together with its titration properties, shows that the transition state is an expanded form of the native state with a weakened but poorly hydrated hydrophobic core, and with disrupted surface regions.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a cytokine and a member of the beta-trefoil superfamily of protein structures. An interesting feature in the folding of IL-1 beta, shared with some other members of the same topological family, is the existence of a slow step in folding to the native conformation from a discrete intermediate. Wanting to probe the nature of this slow step in the folding of WT IL-1 beta (tau(1)=45 seconds), we made ten sequence variants of IL-1 beta (L10A, T9Q, T9G, C8S, C8A, N7G, N7D, L6A, R4P, and R4Q), where all mutations are located along strand 1. This strand is not protected from hydrogen exchange until late in folding. Most of the mutations showed little effect on the kinetics of folding for IL-1 beta. However, C8 is clearly involved in both the late and the early steps in folding, while sequence variants at L10 and L6 affect only late events in folding. The value of the slowest relaxation time, tau(1), which is associated with the rate of native protein formation, increased for the refolding of C8S, while C8A, L6A, and L10A showed smaller but systematic increases in the value of tau(1.)For both C8S and C8A, the value of the step associated with formation of the intermediate, tau(2), was independent of denaturant concentration. In addition, mutations in the hydrophobic core (L10A, C8A, C8S, and L6A) and, surprisingly, along the surface (T9G, T9Q, and N7G) alter the stability. The most destabilizing mutations show changes in equilibrium unfolding cooperativity, which is atypical for destabilizing mutations in IL-1 beta. Crystallographic studies indicate that mutations along strand 1 may alter the number of ordered water molecules within the core. Thus, side-chain replacement in this region can disrupt essential main-chain interactions mediated by ordered water contacts in a highly cooperative network of hydrogen bonding.",

        "abstract": "Protein folding is often retarded by the cis reversible trans isomerizations of prolyl peptide bonds both in vitro and in vivo. An important role for the folding mechanism is well established for the prolyl peptide bonds that are cis in the native protein, but not for those that are trans. Here we investigated the role of trans-Pro73 for the folding of ribonuclease T1 (which additionally contains two cis-prolines) by comparing the wild-type protein with the Pro73-->Val variant. The Pro-->Val substitution led to a destabilization of the folded protein by 8.5 kJ/mol, which is explained by the strong, 25-fold increase in the rate of unfolding. In contrast, the rates and amplitudes of the fast and slow refolding reactions were virtually unchanged. trans-Proline residues remain largely trans after unfolding, and therefore their contributions to the observed folding kinetics should indeed be insignificant for proteins which also contain one or more cis prolines. The cis-proline residues dominate the kinetics of refolding, because almost all slow-folding molecules contain the respective incorrect (trans) isomers, and because trans-->cis isomerizations are slower than cis-->trans isomerizations. The inability to detect contributions from a trans-proline to the kinetics of folding does not imply that this proline is non-essential for folding in the sense that its cis reversible trans isomerization is energetically uncoupled from conformational folding.",

        "abstract": "The villin headpiece (HP67) is a 67 residue, monomeric protein derived from the C-terminal domain of villin. Wild-type HP67 (WT HP67) is the smallest fragment of villin that retains strong in vitro actin-binding activity. WT HP67 is made up of two subdomains, which form a tightly packed interface. The C-terminal subdomain of WT HP67, denoted HP35, is rich in helical structure, folds in isolation, and has been widely used as a model system for folding studies. In contrast, very little is known about the folding of the intact villin headpiece domain. Here, NMR, CD and H/2H amide exchange measurements are used to follow the pH, thermal and urea-induced unfolding of WT HP67 and a mutant (HP67 H41Y) in which a buried conserved histidine in the N-terminal subdomain, His41, has been mutated to Tyr. Although most small proteins display two-state equilibrium unfolding, the results presented here demonstrate that unfolding of the villin headpiece is a multistate process. The presence of a folded N-terminal subdomain is shown to stabilize the C-terminal subdomain, increasing the midpoints of the thermal and urea-induced unfolding transitions and increasing protection factors for H/2H exchange. Histidine 41 has been shown to act as a pH-dependent switch in wild-type HP67: the N-terminal subdomain is unfolded when His41 is protonated, while the C-terminal subdomain remains folded irrespective of the protonation state of His41. Mutation of His41 to Tyr eliminates the segmental pH-dependent unfolding of the headpiece. The mutation stabilizes both domains, but folding is still multistate, indicating that His41 is not solely responsible for the unusual equilibrium unfolding behavior of villin headpiece domain.",

        "abstract": "We have used thermodynamic and kinetic techniques to monitor the guanidinium chloride induced (GdmCl-induced) denaturation of N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase from Escherichia coli (ePRAI). Although CD-monitored equilibrium denaturation curves are consistent with cooperative unfolding of the protein centered at 1.45 M GdmCl, fluorescence readings drop by over 25% in the region preceding the CD-monitored transition, suggesting non-two-state behavior. Kinetics experiments measure a slow relaxation rate with negative fluorescence amplitude when protein is diluted from 0 to 0.5 M GdmCl, corroborating results from equilibrium conditions. Detection of several unfolding and refolding rates in final GdmCl concentrations from 0 to 5.0 M indicates the presence of at least one intermediate along unfolding and refolding pathways. GdmCl dependence of the relaxation rates can be explained most easily by a nonsequential mechanism for ePRAI unfolding, though a sequential mechanism cannot be ruled out. The data corroborate the fragment complementation studies of Eder and Kirschner [Eder, J., & Kischner, K. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 3617-3625], which are consistent with unfolding of the C-terminal portion of a yeast-derived PRAI in its folding intermediate. In ePRAI, such partial unfolding would expose W391 to quenching by solvent molecules; W356, ePRAI's other tryptophan, is buried in the hydrophobic core and is unlikely to be affected by local changes in structure. A C-terminally unfolded folding intermediate has been demonstrated in the folding of tryptophan synthase (alpha-subunit), a related beta alpha-barrel enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The monomeric gamma-crystallins and oligomeric beta-crystallins have paired homologous double Greek key domains, presumably evolved through gene duplication and fusion. Prior investigation of the refolding of human gammaD-crystallin revealed that the C-terminal domain folds first and nucleates the folding of the N-terminal domain. This result suggested that the human N-terminal domain might not be able to fold on its own. We constructed and expressed polypeptide chains corresponding to the isolated N- and C-terminal domains of human gammaD-crystallin, as well as the isolated domains of human gammaS-crystallin. Both circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the isolated domains purified from Escherichia coli were folded into native-like monomers. After denaturation, the isolated domains refolded efficiently at pH 7 and 37 degrees C into native-like structures. The in vitro refolding of all four domains revealed two kinetic phases, identifying partially folded intermediates for the Greek key motifs. When subjected to thermal denaturation, the isolated N-terminal domains were less stable than the full-length proteins and less stable than the C-terminal domains, and this was confirmed in equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments. The decrease in stability of the N-terminal domain of human gammaD-crystallin with respect to the complete protein indicated that the interdomain interface contributes of 4.2 kcal/mol to the overall stability of this very long-lived protein.",

All of the mutants displayed cooperative thermal melts and appeared to have well-packed hydrophobic cores by near-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, indicating that conformational specificity is maintained. The Arc variant (MYL-NA29/SA44/EA48) in which the entire six-residue polar network is replaced by nonpolar groups is 5.1 kcal/mol of dimer more stable than wild type, indicating that the strategy of replacing buried or partially buried charged and polar side chains with hydrophobic residues can lead to substantial stabilization.",

CBDN1 has a relatively low maximum stability (delta Gmax = 33 kJ/mol = 216 J/residue at 1 degree C and pH 6.1) compared to other small single-domain globular proteins. The unfolding is fully reversible between pH 5.5 and 9 and in accordance with the two-state equilibrium model between pH 5.5 and 11. When the single disulfide bond in CBDN1 is reduced, the protein remains unfolded at all conditions, as judged by NMR spectroscopy. This indicates that the intramolecular cross-link makes a major contribution to the stability of CBDN1. The measured heat capacity change of unfolding (delta Cp = 7.5 kJ mol-1 K-1) agrees well with that calculated from the predicted changes in the solvent accessible nonpolar and polar surface areas upon unfolding. Extrapolation of the specific enthalpy and entropy of unfolding to their respective convergence temperature indicates that per residue unfolding energies for CBDN1, an isolated domain, are in accordance with those found by Privalov (1) for many single-domain globular proteins. DSC thermograms of the unfolding of CBDN1 in the presence of various concentrations of cellopentaose were fit to a thermodynamic model describing the linkage between protein-ligand binding and protein unfolding.

        "abstract": "An intricate architecture of covalent bonds and noncovalent interactions appear to position the side chain of Lys 41 properly within the active site of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A). One of these interactions arises from Tyr 97, which is conserved in all 41 RNase A homologues of known sequence. Tyr 97 has a solvent-inaccessible side chain that donates a hydrogen bond to the main-chain oxygen of Lys 41. Here, the role of Tyr 97 was examined by replacing Tyr 97 with a phenylalanine, alanine, or glycine residue. All three mutant proteins have diminished catalytic activity, with the value of Kcat being perturbed more significantly than that of Km. The free energies with which Y97F, Y97A, and Y97G RNase A bind to the rate-limiting transition state during the cleavage of poly(cytidylic acid) are diminished by 0.74, 3.3, and 3.8 kcal/mol, respectively. These results show that even though Tyr 97 is remote from the active site, its side chain contributes to catalysis. The role of Tyr 97 in the thermal stability of RNase A is large. The conformational free energies of native Y97F, Y97A, and Y97G RNase A are decreased by 3.54, 12.0, and 11.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The unusually large decrease in stability caused by the Tyr-->Phe mutation could result from a decrease in the barrier to isomerization of the Lys 41-Pro 42 peptide bond.",

        "abstract": "The conformational stabilities of bovine lens gamma-crystallin fractions II, IIIA, IIIB, and IVA and those modified with glutathione were compared by studying the thermal and guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) denaturation behavior. The conformational state was monitored by both far-UV CD and fluorescence measurements. All the gamma-crystallins studied showed a sigmoidal order-disorder transition with varied melting temperatures. The thermal denaturation of these proteins is reversible up to a temperature 3 or 4 degrees C above T 1/2; above this temperature, irreversible aggregation occurs. The validity of a two-state approximation of both thermal and Gdn-HCl denaturation was tested for all four crystallins, and the presence of one or more intermediates was evident in the unfolding of IVA. delta GDH2O values of these crystallins range from 4 to 9 kcal/mol. Upon glutathione treatment IVA showed the maximum decrease in T 1/2 by approximately 9 degrees C and in delta GDH2O value by 29%; the smallest decrease in T 1/2 was for IIIA by 2 degrees C and in delta GDH2O by 15%. We have demonstrated that the glutathione reaction can dramatically reduce the conformational stability of gamma-crystallins and, thus, that the thermodynamic quantities of the unreacted crystallins can be used to evaluate the stability of these proteins when modified during cataract formation.",

We show here that prolyl isomerizations in the course of protein unfolding are also well catalyzed. To demonstrate catalysis we use cytoplasmic prolyl isomerase from Escherichia coli as the enzyme and reduced and carboxymethylated ribonuclease T1 as the substrate. This form of ribonuclease T1 without disulfide bonds is nativelike folded only in the presence of moderate concentrations of NaCl. Unfolding can be induced by reducing the NaCl concentration at ambient temperature and in the absence of denaturants. Under these conditions prolyl isomerase retains its activity and it catalyzes prolyl cis/trans isomerization in the unfolding protein. Under identical conditions within the NaCl-induced transition unfolding and refolding are catalyzed with equal efficiency. The stability of the protein and thus the final distribution of unfolded and folded molecules attained at equilibrium is unchanged in the presence of prolyl isomerase. These results demonstrate that prolyl isomerase functions in protein folding as an enzyme and catalyzes prolyl isomerization in either direction.",

Upon acidification to endosomal pH the alpha-helical content of the protein is reduced and the beta-sheet content increased by nearly 10%.

        "abstract": "While the role of the signal sequence in targeting proteins to specific subcellular compartments is well characterized, there are fewer studies that characterize its effects on the stability and folding kinetics of the protein. We report a detailed characterization of the folding kinetics and thermodynamic stabilities of maltose binding protein (MBP) and its precursor form, preMBP. Isothermal GdmCl and urea denaturation as a function of temperature and thermal denaturation studies have been carried out to compare stabilities of the two proteins. preMBP was found to be destabilized by about 2-6 kcal/mol (20-40%) with respect to MBP. Rapid cleavage of the signal peptide by various proteases shows that the signal peptide is accessible in the native form of preMBP. The observed rate constant of the major slow phase in folding was decreased 5-fold in preMBP relative to MBP. The rate constants of unfolding were similar at 25 degrees C, but preMBP also exhibited a large burst phase change in unfolding that was absent in MBP. At 10 degrees C, preMBP exhibited a higher unfolding rate than MBP as well as a large burst phase. The appreciable destabilization of MBP by signal peptide is functionally relevant, because it enhances the likelihood of finding the protein in an unfolded translocation-competent form and may influence the interactions of the protein with the translocation machinery. Destabilization is likely to result from favorable interactions between the hydrophobic signal peptide and other hydrophobic regions that are exposed in the unfolded state.",

        "abstract": "Zinc-substituted Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin folds in two-state equilibrium and kinetic reactions. In the unfolded state, the zinc ion remains bound to the unfolded polypeptide via two native-state ligands (His117 and Cys112). The significantly curved Chevron plot for zinc-substituted azurin was earlier ascribed to movement of the folding-transition state. At low concentrations of denaturant, the transition state occurs early in the folding reaction (low Tanford beta-value), whereas at high-denaturant concentration, it moves closer to the native structure (high Tanford beta-value). Here, we use this movement to track the formation and growth of zinc-substituted azurin's folding nucleus with atomic resolution using protein engineering. The average phi (phi) value for 17 positions (covering all secondary-structure elements) goes from 0.25 in 0 M GuHCl (beta approximately 0.46) to 0.76 in 4 M GuHCl (beta approximately 0.86); a phi-value of 1 or 0 indicates native-like or unfolded-like interactions, respectively. Analysis of individual phi-values reveals a delocalized nucleus where structure condenses around a leading density centered on Leu50 in the core. The diffuse moving transition state for zinc-substituted azurin is in sharp contrast to the fixed polarized folding nucleus observed for apo-azurin. The dramatic difference in apparent kinetic behavior for the two forms of azurin can be rationalized as a minor alteration on a common free-energy profile that exhibits a broad activation barrier.",

Tropomyosin unfolds with two transitions, namely local and global unfolding at high salt (greater than 0.1 M NaCl) and pH 7.5. The local unfolding was masked by the global unfolding at low salt (less than 0.1 M NaCl), at high pH (greater than pH 9.0), and in the presence of methanol, where the global unfolding temperature was similar to or lower than the local unfolding temperature. The local and global unfolding are different in nature. A comparison of the helix thermal unfolding of N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide-tropomyosin with unlabeled tropomyosin showed that tropomyosin had an inherent less-stable region, when Cys190 was N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide-labeled, disulfide cross-linked, or reduced. Instead, the chemical state of Cys190, determined the stability of the local unfolding region, because a strain created by the disulfide cross-link or the pyrene/pyrene interaction decreases the stability of the local unfolding region. Thus, these data show that the excimer fluorescence of N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide-labeled tropomyosin is useful for studying the local and global unfolding of tropomyosin.",

        "abstract": "The rate-limiting steps in the folding of dihydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli have been shown to involve the conversion of a set of four intermediates to a corresponding set of native conformers via four parallel channels [Jennings et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 3783-3789]. Fluorescence and absorbance studies of the unfolding and refolding of the C85S/C152E double mutant at various final urea concentrations reveal two slow folding reactions, two fewer than observed in the wild-type protein. Refolding in the presence of substoichiometric levels of the inhibitor methotrexate shows that the two remaining slow reactions correspond to two parallel channels which lead to a pair of native conformers capable of binding the inhibitor. A combination of stopped-flow circular dichroism and cofactor binding studies confirms that the four parallel channels observed in the wild-type protein have collapsed into two channels in the mutant. Kinetic and equilibrium studies of the single cysteine mutants suggest that replacements of Cysteine-85 which perturb the hydrophobic core containing this side chain are responsible for the simplification of the kinetic mechanism. These results demonstrate that at least two of the parallel folding channels in dihydrofolate reductase arise when tertiary structure develops and are not dependent upon cis/trans isomerization at prolyl peptide bonds.",

ATP, ADP, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5')-pentaphosphate, and to a lesser extent AMP protect the enzyme against inactivation by phenylglyoxal. Site-directed mutagenesis of Arg-88 to glycine yields a modified form of adenylate kinase (RG88 mutant) closely related structurally to the wild-type protein as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and limited proteolysis. However, this modified protein has only 1% of the maximum catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme and 5- and 85-fold higher apparent Km values for ATP and AMP, respectively, than the parent adenylate kinase. Arg-88, which is a highly conserved residue in all known molecular forms of adenylate kinases (corresponding to Arg-97 in muscle cytosolic enzyme), should be located inside a big cleft of the molecule, close to the phosphate-binding loop. It possibly stabilizes the transferable gamma-phosphate group from ATP to AMP in the transition state.",

Mutations that destabilize the folded state relative to the folding intermediate had been previously identified from the free energy profiles for the unfolding of mutant proteins. It is predicted that the accumulation of such mutations should lead to the intermediate being the most stable species at certain concentrations of denaturant. Mutants were prepared that contained combinations of such mutations. The behavior of these mutants on urea denaturation was studied by probes for tertiary structure (fluorescence, near-UV CD), secondary structure (far-UV CD), and hydrodynamic volume (size-exclusion chromatography). Whereas wild-type shows a two-state transition in all cases, with the same thermodynamic values being found by all probes, some of the mutants show different transitions with different structural probes. On increasing concentration of denaturant, the tertiary structure of these mutants is lost before all the secondary structure and before the protein shows the maximum expanded volume that is characteristic of the unfolded state. These mutants thus accumulate an intermediate state at equilibrium under certain urea concentrations. The intermediate state retains some degree of secondary structure but has a disrupted tertiary structure, and its degree of compactness is intermediate between the folded and the unfolded forms, probably expanding with increasing concentration of denaturant. The accumulation of the intermediate should allow its direct characterization by spectroscopy, especially NMR.",

N174 (Trp28, Trp101, and Trp227) were mutated to phenylalanine, and thermal unfolding experiments of the proteins were done in order to investigate the role of tryptophan residues in thermal stability. Four types of mutants (W28F, W101F, W227F and W28F/W101F) were produced in sufficient quantity in our expression system using Streptomyces lividans TK24. Each unfolding curve obtained by CD at 222 nm did not exhibit a two-state transition profile, but exhibited a biphasic profile: a first cooperative phase and a second phase that is less cooperative. The single tryptophan mutation decreased the midpoint temperature (Tm) of the first transition phase by about 7 degrees C, and the double mutation by about 11 degrees C. The second transition phase in each mutant chitosanase was more distinct and extended than that in the wild-type. On the other hand, each unfolding curve obtained by tryptophan fluorescence exhibited a typical two-state profile and agreed with the first phase of transition curves obtained by CD. Differential scanning calorimetry profiles of the proteins were consistent with the data obtained by CD. These data suggested that the mutation of individual tryptophan residues would partly collapse the side chain interactions, consequently decreasing Tm and enhancing the formation of a molten globule-like intermediate in the thermal unfolding process. The tryptophan side chains are most likely to play important roles in cooperative stabilization of the protein.",

The DSC endotherm of the holoprotein ([retinol]/[protein] = 1) was asymmetric about the transition temperature of 78 degrees C. Using changes in ellipticity at 230 nm, the thermal unfolding curve was also asymmetric about the inflection point centered near 78 degrees C. van't Hoff enthalpies were determined by three means and compared to the calorimetric enthalpy (delta Hcal) of 200 kcal/mol. A van't Hoff enthalpy of 190 kcal/mol was determined from the dependence of transition temperature on the concentration of the ligand-bound protein. This value agreed well with the van't Hoff enthalpies found from fits of the DSC (delta HvH = 184 kcal/mol) and spectroscopic (delta HvH = 181 kcal/mol) curves to a two-state thermodynamic model that included ligand dissociation (NR in equilibrium with U+R, where NR is the native holoprotein, U is the unfolded apoprotein, and R is retinol). Poor agreement was obtained with a two-state model that ignored ligand dissociation (N in equilibrium with U). Furthermore, the NR in equilibrium with U+R model accounted for the asymmetry in both CD and DSC transitions and yielded a much improved fit of the data over the N in equilibrium with U model. From these considerations and simulations on other equilibrium models, it is suggested that the NR in equilibrium with U+R model is the simplest model that describes the thermal unfolding of this ligand-bound protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The two BPTI analogues studied were BPTI having Cys-14 and Cys-38 carboxymethylated (BPTI-RCOM) and BPTI having Cys-14 and Cys-38 carboxamidomethylated (BPTI-RCAM). They were obtained from native BPTI by reduction, followed by modification of the sulfhydryl groups with iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide, respectively. The temperature dependence of all thermodynamic parameters of BPTI is drastically altered in the absence of the third disulfide bridge. Even the apparently minute difference of two dissociable carboxyl groups instead of uncharged amide groups in positions 14 and 38 has surprisingly large effects on the temperature dependence of the stabilization enthalpy. The Gibbs energy of BPTI at pH 2, 25 degrees C, decreases by approximately 70% when the 14-38 disulfide bond is cleaved. BPTI-RCOM is more stable than BPTI-RCAM in the whole pH range studied. The difference of -4 kJ/mol at pH 2, 25 degrees C, is reduced to -2.7 kJ/mol at pH 5, 25 degrees C. This finding demonstrates that the presence of two negative charges reduces the higher stability of BPTI-RCOM slightly; however, the overall effect of the two charges is still a stabilization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We examined the structure and stability of the I59A-3SS mutant human lysozyme, in which a cavity is created at the mutation site. The crystal structure of I59A-3SS indicated that there were ordered new water molecules in the cavity created. The stability of I59A-3SS is 5.5 kJ/mol less than that of 3SS. The decreased stability of I59A-3SS (5.5 kJ/mol) is similar to that of Ile to Ala mutants with newly introduced water molecules in other globular proteins (6.3 +/- 2.1 kJ/mol), but is less than that of Ile/Leu to Ala mutants with empty cavities (13.7 +/- 3.1 kJ/mol). This indicates that water molecules partially compensate for the destabilization by decreasing hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions.

The cyanomet form of myoglobin satisfies this condition at pH 5, 25 degrees C. The unfolding curves monitored by far-UV CD and Soret absorbance are superimposable and reversible. None of the putative ion pairs studied here makes a large contribution to the stability of native myoglobin.

        "abstract": "Equilibrium denaturation experiments were performed on human growth hormone (hGH) under acidic conditions (pH 1.5-3.0) and different protein concentrations. At 0.1 mg/ml hGH using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) detection, midpoint values of 4.6 M GdnHCl were observed that are identical to those obtained at neutral pH. However, the delta G values were reduced at pH 2.5 relative to pH 8.0 (10.5 vs. 15 kcal/mol). Increasing the protein concentration to 1 mg/ml resulted in a biphasic denaturation profile by far-UV CD detection at 222 nm, while near-UV CD measurements at 295 nm yielded a cooperative transition with a midpoint value of 3.6 M GdnHCl. These results indicate that equilibrium intermediates having a propensity to aggregate are highly populated under acid conditions. Static light scattering measurements performed under partial unfolding conditions (4.5 M GdnHCl) at pH 2.5 confirmed the existence of a large molecular weight (congruent to 80 kDa) self-associated intermediate. No evidence of aggregation was found for hGH under acid conditions in the absence of denaturant, indicating that self-association results from the formation of an intermediate. Equilibrium GdnHCl concentration-jump experiments confirmed that association only occurs from an intermediate species and not from any other conformational state, and formation of the self-associated intermediate can lead to irreversible loss of protein due to precipitation. These results demonstrate that acid stabilizes equilibrium folding intermediates of hGH.",

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of laccase from the Japanese lacquer tree (Rhus vernicifera) was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The endotherms of holo-laccase, type 2-Cu-depleted laccase and apo-laccase were deconvoluted into two independent two-state transitions, providing evidence for a domain structure of the protein. The correlation of the two transitions with the bleaching of copper optical bands and the decrease of the transitions' enthalpy on Cu removal show that the process involves the denaturation of Cu sites. No detectable unfolding of secondary structure was observed, since the thermal transitions, characterized by low overall specific enthalpy, did not modify either the laccase c.d. spectra in the beta-fold region or the maximum wavelength of the fluorescence emission. On chemical denaturation, however, the emission was red-shifted by about 20 nm. The laccase behaviour is substantially different from that of stellacyanin, a protein containing a single blue Cu ion, in which the thermal transition had higher specific enthalpy and induced a large change of the c.d. spectrum in the beta-fold region. The laccase denaturation behaviour is similar to that of ascorbate oxidase from zucchini (courgette; Cucurbita pepo) [Savini, D'Alessio, Giartosio, Morpurgo and Avigliano (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 190, 491-495], suggesting a structural analogy. In both proteins heating may cause a change of tertiary structure through modifications of Cu co-ordination with loosening of the bonds between the structural domains at the interface of which the trinuclear Cu cluster is located.",

The leuB gene encoding B. subtilis 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase was integrated into the chromosome of a leuB-deficient strain of T. thermophilus. The resulting transformant showed a leucine-autotrophy at 56 degrees C but not at 61 degrees C and above. Phenotypically thermostabilized strains that can grow at 61 degrees C without leucine were isolated from spontaneous mutants. Screening temperature was stepwise increased from 61 to 66 and then to 70 degrees C and mutants that showed a leucine-autotrophic growth at 70 degrees C were obtained. DNA sequence analyses of the leuB genes from the mutant strains revealed three stepwise amino acid replacements, threonine-308 to isoleucine, isoleucine-95 to leucine, and methionine-292 to isoleucine. The mutant enzymes with these amino acid replacements were more stable against heat treatment than the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the triple-mutant enzyme showed significantly higher specific activity than that of the wild-type enzyme.",

        "abstract": "What are the selective pressures on protein sequences during evolution? Amino acid residues may be highly conserved for functional or structural (stability) reasons. Theoretical studies have proposed that residues involved in the folding nucleus may also be highly conserved. To test this we are using an experimental \"fold approach\" to the study of protein folding. This compares the folding and stability of a number of proteins that share the same fold, but have no common amino acid sequence or biological activity. The fold selected for this study is the immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich fold, which is a fold that has no specifically conserved function. Four model proteins are used from two distinct superfamilies that share the immunoglobulin-like fold, the fibronectin type III and immunoglobulin superfamilies. Here, the fold approach and protein engineering are used to question the role of a highly conserved tyrosine in the \"tyrosine corner\" motif that is found ubiquitously and exclusively in Greek key proteins. In the four model beta-sandwich proteins characterised here, the tyrosine is the only residue that is absolutely conserved at equivalent sites. By mutating this position to phenylalanine, we show that the tyrosine hydroxyl is not required to nucleate folding in the immunoglobulin superfamily, whereas it is involved to some extent in early structure formation in the fibronectin type III superfamily. The tyrosine corner is important for stability, mutation to phenylalanine costs between 1.5 and 3 kcal mol(-1). We propose that the high level of conservation of the tyrosine is related to the structural restraints of the loop connecting the beta-sheets, representing an evolutionary \"cul-de-sac\".",

The same experiment, monitored by one-dimensional proton NMR, shows another cooperative process between 5 and 9 M urea that involves His92 (Saab-Rinc\u00f3n G et al., 1993, Biochemistry 32:13,981-13,990). To further test and quantify the implied four-state model, N <--> I1 <--> I2 <--> U, the urea-induced equilibrium unfolding process was followed by tyrosine fluorescence total intensity, tyrosine fluorescence anisotropy and far-UV CD. All three techniques resolve the four stable states, and the transitions between them when the FL total intensity and CD spectroscopy data were analyzed by the singular value decomposition method. Relative to U, the stabilities of the N, I1, and I2 states are 15.4, 9.4, and 4.9 kcal mol(-1), respectively. I2 partially buries one or more of the seven tyrosines with a noticeable restriction of their motion; it also recovers approximately 6% of the native CD signal. This intermediate, which is known to be stabilized by the hydrophobic effect, appears to reflect the early coalescence of nonpolar side chains without significant organization of the backbone. I1 recovers an additional 43% of the CD signal, further sequesters tyrosine residues in nonpolar environments, and restricts their motion to an extent similar to N. The progressive development of a higher order structure as the denaturant concentration decreases implies a monotonic contraction in the ensemble of conformations that represent the U, I2, I1, and N states of alphaTS.",

The selectivity is explained in part by a kinetic partitioning between the folding of a polypeptide and its association with SecB. SecB has no affinity for native, stably folded polypeptides but interacts tightly with polypeptides that are nonnative. In order to better understand the nature of the binding, we have examined the interaction of SecB with intermediates along the folding pathway of maltose-binding protein. Taking advantage of forms of maltose-binding protein that are altered in their folding properties, we show that the first intermediate in folding, represented by the collapsed state, binds to SecB, and that the polypeptide remains active as a ligand until it crosses the final energy barrier to attain the native state.",

        "abstract": "Scanning microcalorimetric and circular dichroism studies of the normal and mutant flagellins of Salmonella suggest that they have a multidomain structure in common. Flagellin polymers (flagella) are depolymerized irreversibly into monomers as the temperature is raised, and the monomers undergo denaturation reversibly when cooled and heated again. The calorimetric enthalpy of this reversible process is twice as large as the van't Hoff enthalpy, suggesting that flagellin monomers contain two co-operative regions that melt independently at the same temperature. In all flagellin specimens examined, the ellipticity at the same temperature. In all flagellin specimens examined, the ellipticity at 222 nm of polymers at room temperature is 1.6 times as large as that of monomers, and the dependence of ellipticity on temperature takes place in the same temperature intervals in which calorimetric effects take place. From these results, we propose that flagellin molecules consist of several domains, two of which are distinctly structured in monomers at room temperature, while the others acquire more regular structures during polymerization.",

        "abstract": "R67 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a novel protein that provides clinical resistance to the antibacterial drug trimethoprim. The crystal structure of a dimeric form of R67 DHFR indicates the first 16 amino acids are disordered [Matthews et al. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 4194-4204]. To investigate whether these amino acids are necessary for protein function, the first 16 N-terminal residues have been cleaved off by chymotrypsin. The truncated protein is fully active with kcat = 1.3 s-1, Km(NADPH) = 3.0 microM, and Km(dihydrofolate) = 5.8 microM. This result suggests the functional core of the protein resides in the beta-barrel structure defined by residues 27-78. To study this protein further, synthetic genes coding for full-length and truncated R67 DHFRs were constructed. Surprisingly, the gene coding for truncated R67 DHFR does not produce protein in vivo or confer trimethoprim resistance upon Escherichia coli. Therefore, the relative stabilities of native and truncated R67 DHFR were investigated by equilibrium unfolding studies. Unfolding of dimeric native R67 DHFR is protein concentration dependent and can be described by a two-state model involving native dimer and unfolded monomer. Using absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism techniques, an average delta GH2O of 13.9 kcal mol-1 is found for native R67 DHFR. In contrast, an average delta GH2O of 11.3 kcal mol-1 is observed for truncated R67 DHFR. These results indicate native R67 DHFR is 2.6 kcal mol-1 more stable than truncated protein. This stability difference may be part of the reason why protein from the truncated gene is not found in vivo in E. coli.",

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI, which requires divalent cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+) for activity, was thermostabilized by 2.6-3.0 kcal/mol in the presence of the Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+ ion, probably because the negative charge repulsion around the active site was canceled upon the binding of these metal ions. The dissociation constants were determined to be 0.71 mM for Mg2+, 0.035 mM for Mn2+, and 0.16 mM for Ca2+. Likewise, various active site mutants at Asp10, Glu48, Asp70, or Asp134 were thermostabilized by 0.4-3.0 kcal/mol in the presence of the Mg2+ ion, suggesting that this ion binds to these mutant proteins as well. The dissociation constants of Mg2+ were determined to be 9.8 mM for D10N, 1.1 mM for E48Q, 18.8 mM for D70N, and 1.8 mM for D134N. Thus, the mutation of Asp10 or Asp70 to Asn considerably impairs the Mg2+ binding, whereas the mutation of Glu48 to Gln or Asp134 to Asn does not. Comparison of the thermal stability of the mutant proteins with that of the wild-type protein in the absence of the Mg2+ ion suggests that the negative charge repulsion between Asp10 and Asp70 is responsible for the binding of the metal cofactor. Glu48 may be required to anchor a water molecule, which functions as a general acid.",

        "abstract": "Understanding refolding pathways of recombinant antibody fragments is essential for efficient production of these proteins of high biomedical significance. The recombinant VL domain of mouse anti-human ferritin antibody F11 formed two distinct functional conformations obtained by refolding from bacterial inclusion bodies using two different procedures. Involvement of a dialysis step at pH 2-3 resulted in the VL-1 conformation with fluorescence of the highly conserved Trp-35 residue quenched by the spatially proximal disulfide bond. This conformation was identical to the 'native' VL domain folded in host cells and purified from the cytoplasm. In the absence of the acidic dialysis step, the VL domain adopted a previously unreported conformation, VL-2, that demonstrated prominent fluorescence due to a local structural disorder around Trp-35. Furthermore, VL-2 showed changes in secondary structure and significantly lower stability as determined by differential scanning calorimetry and denaturant-induced unfolding. While more flexible VL-2 binds human ferritin both in solution and after surface adsorption of the antibody domain, the VL-1 conformer needs an adsorption-induced conformational change to allow the access of ferritin to the antigen-binding site. Noteworthy, the two macroscopic conformations constitute kinetically trapped dimers and do not interconvert at elevated temperatures (3 weeks at 37 degrees C or 15 min at 60 degrees C), which indicates a high energetic barrier between them. As a major finding, this paper provides the first description for two stable and functional conformations of an antibody domain.",

Changes in enthalpy are largely compensated by changes in entropy.

Denaturation monitored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) was typically over 90% reversible in pH 7.0 buffer. The wild-type c-fragment exhibited one transition (Tm = 51 degrees C), which was taken as the main denaturation transition. c-Fragments derived from signaling mutants, shown to form oligomers by gel filtration chromatography (GFC), displayed a second low-temperature transition that correlated with the disappearance of the oligomeric form in the GFC traces over the same temperature range. The CD and DSC experiments also indicated that oligomers were more folded than monomers, observations that may provide an explanation for the structural basis of the smooth-swimming signaling state of the receptor. Octyl glucoside (OG), phospholipid (PL), and glycerol were added to characterize factors that contribute to c-fragment stability. At 10 mg/mL OG, the van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding was reduced ca. 10-fold, although at room temperature the CD spectrum indicated little change in the secondary structure. The van't Hoff enthalpy was not affected by 35% (w/v) glycerol, but the Tm increased by ca. 18 degrees C. Cooperative transitions were detected in buffer containing OG, PL, and glycerol (10 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, 35%, respectively). The correlation between conditions where cooperative transitions are observed, and where aspartate-modulated receptor signaling has been previously observed, provides an explanation for the inhibition of signaling in OG-containing buffers without glycerol and PL.",

The N-terminal half of InlB (residues 36-321, InlB321), which is sufficient for this process, contains a central leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that is flanked by a small alpha-helical cap and an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain. Here we investigated the spectroscopic properties, stability and folding of InlB321 and of a shorter variant lacking the Ig-like domain (InlB248). The circular dichroism spectra of both protein variants in the far ultraviolet region are very similar, with a characteristic minimum found at approximately 200 nm, possibly resulting from the high 3(10)-helical content in the LRR domain. Upon addition of chemical denaturants, both variants unfold in single transitions with unusually high cooperativity that are fully reversible and best described by two-state equilibria. The free energies of GdmCl-induced unfolding determined from transitions at 20 degrees C are 9.9(+/-0.8)kcal/mol for InlB321 and 5.4(+/-0.4)kcal/mol for InlB248. InlB321 is also more stable against thermal denaturation, as observed by scanning calorimetry. This suggests, that the Ig-like domain, which presumably does not directly interact with the host cell receptor during bacterial invasion, plays a critical role for the in vivo stability of InlB.",

All mutated lysozymes were less stable than the wild-type by about 1 kcal/mol and it is suggested that this instability was caused by the change in residual hydrophobicity from isoleucine to methionine. The X-ray structures of all mutant lysozymes were very similar to that of the wild-type. In addition, both the accessible surface areas and the conformation of the side chain of methionine in all mutant lysozymes were similar to those of the side chain at the respective isoleucine in the wild-type.

The effect of hydrostatic and osmotic pressures on the aging process of DFP-phosphorylated enzymes (diisopropylphosphoryl-BuChE (DIP-BuChE)) was investigated. Hydrostatic pressure strongly increased the rate of aging of wt enzyme. The activation volumes (deltaV*) for the dealkylation reaction was -150 ml/mol for DIP-wtBuChE. On the other hand, pressure had little effect on the aging of the DIP-E197D mutant and no effect on the DIP-D70G mutant, indicating that the transition state of the aging reaction (dealkylation of an isoproxy chain) was associated with an extended conformation/hydration change in wtBuChE but not in mutants. The rate of aging decreased with osmotic pressure, supporting the idea that water is important for stabilizing the transition state. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the wtDIP adduct to relate the kinetic data to hydration changes in the enzyme active site gorge. The pH dependence of the melting temperature (Tm) of native and soman-wtBuChE, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), indicated that the stabilization energy of aged BuChE is mainly due to the salt bridge between protonated H438 and PO-, with pK(H438) = 8.3. Electrophoresis under high pressure up to 2.5 kbar showed that aged wtBuChE did not undergo pressure-induced molten globule transition unlike the native enzyme. This transition was not seen for the mutant enzymes, indicating that mutants are resistant to the penetration of water into their structure. Our results support the conclusion that D70 and E197 are major residues for the water/H-bond network dynamics in the active site gorge of BuChE, both residues acting like valves. In mutant enzymes, mutated residues function like check valves: forced penetration of water in the gorge is difficult, release of water is facilitated.",

        "abstract": "Thermal denaturation of two homologous proteins, low-M(r) cysteine-proteinase inhibitors stefins A and B, has been investigated by microcalorimetry. Calorimetric enthalpies, as well as the temperatures at maximum heat capacity, were determined as a function of pH for each protein. Transitions were found reversible at all pH values examined (5.0, 6.5, 8.1) for the thermally more stable stefin A, in contrast to stefin B. Stefin B shows a sharp irreversible transition around 65 degrees C at pH 6.5 and 8.1, probably due to unfolding of a dimeric state followed by oligomerisation. At pH 5.0, both proteins exhibit a reversible transition with temperatures of half-denaturation at 50.2 degrees C and 90.8 degrees C for stefins B and A, respectively. The calorimetric enthalpies, which equal the van't Hoff enthalpies to within 10%, are 293 kJ/mol and 490 kJ/mol for stefins B and A, respectively. Using the predictive method of Ooi and Oobatake (1991) [Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 88, 2859] the thermodynamic functions of unfolding were calculated for stefin B, whose three-dimensional structure has been determined. The calculated enthalpy, heat-capacity change on unfolding and the temperature of half denaturation compare well to the microcalorimetric data.",

The hydrogen bonding and the ion pair contributed 2-5 kJ/mol to the conformational stability of CK. Interestingly, the ability of CK reactivation from the denatured state was completely removed by the mutations.

        "abstract": "A series of hydrophilic to hydrophobic surface mutations were prepared at the highly solvent-exposed lysine 73 of iso-1-cytochrome c to assess the ability of such mutants to affect the energetics of the denatured state. In this report, the aliphatic hydrophobics (leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine, glycine) were studied. The thermodynamic stability of each of these mutants was determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. Both the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, delta GouH2O, and the slope, m, of a plot of the free energy of unfolding, delta Gou, versus [guanidine hydrochloride] show significant negative correlations with the 1-octanol to water transfer free energy, delta Gtr, of the amino acid side chain at position 73. A negative correlation with hydrophobicity is consistent with these mutants leading to more extensive hydrophobic clustering in the denatured state, consistent with the predictions of heteropolymer theory for compact denatured states; an effect operating on the native state energetics should produce a positive correlation of delta GouH2O with hydrophobicity. Infrared amide I spectroscopy indicated native state structural perturbations for the glycine 73 and isoleucine 73 mutants. A moderate correlation of delta GouH2O was also found with alpha-helix propensity, suggesting that both hydrophobic effects acting on the denatured state and alpha-helix propensity are affecting the delta GouH2O values for these mutants.",

        "abstract": "Glutamine 143 in human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) forms a hydrogen bond with the manganese-bound solvent molecule and is investigated by replacement using site-specific mutagenesis. Crystal structures showed that the replacement of Gln 143 with Ala made no significant change in the overall structure of the mutant enzyme. Two new water molecules in Q143A MnSOD were situated in positions nearly identical with the Oepsilon1 and Nepsilon2 of the replaced Gln 143 side chain and maintained a hydrogen-bonded network connecting the manganese-bound solvent molecule to other residues in the active site. However, their presence could not sustain the stability and activity of the enzyme; the main unfolding transition of Q143A was decreased 16 degrees C and its catalysis decreased 250-fold to k(cat)/K(m) = 3 x 10(6) M(-)(1) s(-)(1), as determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry and pulse radiolysis. The mutant Q143A MnSOD and other mutants at position 143 showed very low levels of product inhibition and favored Mn(II)SOD in the resting state, whereas the wild type showed strong product inhibition and favored Mn(III)SOD. However, these differences did not affect the rate constant for dissociation of the product-inhibited complex in Q143A MnSOD which was determined from a characteristic absorbance at 420 nm and was comparable in magnitude ( approximately 100 s(-)(1)) to that of the wild-type enzyme. Hence, Gln 143, which is necessary for maximal activity in superoxide dismutation, appears to have no role in stabilization and dissociation of the product-inhibited complex.",

        "abstract": "Human acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) is a potent mitogen and angiogenic factor, with reportedly poor thermal stability and a relatively short in vivo half-life. However, certain mutants of FGF-1 have been described that exhibit a significant increase in half-life in tissue culture-based assays. FGF-1 contains three cysteine residues, two of which are highly conserved and buried within the protein core. Mutant forms of FGF-1 that substitute a serine residue at these cysteine positions have been reported to increase the protein's half-life and specific activity as well as decrease the dependence upon heparin for full activity. However, the underlying physical basis for this increase in half-life has not been determined. Possible effects include stabilization of protein structure and elimination of sulfhydryl chemistry at these positions. Here we have used differential scanning calorimetry and isothermal equilibrium denaturation to characterize thermodynamic parameters of unfolding for individual, and combination, cysteine to serine mutations in human FGF-1. The results show that substitution by serine is destabilizing at each cysteine position in wild-type FGF-1. Thus, the increased half-life previously reported for these mutations does not correlate with thermal stability and is most likely due to elimination of sulfhydryl chemistry. The results also suggest a method by which protein half-life may be modulated by rational design.",

        "abstract": "Environmental variables can exert significant influences on the folding stability of a protein, and elucidating these influences provides insight on the determinants of protein stability. Here, experimental data on the stability of FKBP12 are reported for the effects of three environmental variables: pH, salt, and macromolecular crowding. In the pH range of 5-9, contribution to the pH dependence of the unfolding free energy from residual charge-charge interactions in the unfolded state was found to be negligible. The negligible contribution was attributed to the lack of sequentially nearest neighboring charged residues around groups that titrate in the pH range. KCl lowered the stability of FKBP12 and the E31Q/D32N double mutant at small salt concentrations but raised stability after approximately 0.5 M salt. Such a turnover behavior was accounted for by the balance of two opposing types of protein-salt interactions: the Debye-H\u00fcckel type, modeling the response of the ions to protein charges, favors the unfolded state while the Kirkwood type, accounting for the disadvantage of the ions moving toward the low-dielectric protein cavity from the bulk solvent, disfavors the unfolded state. Ficoll 70 as a crowding agent was found to have a modest effect on protein stability, in qualitative agreement with a simple model suggesting that the folded and unfolded states are nearly equally adversely affected by macromolecular crowding. For any environmental variable, it is the balance of its effects on the folded and unfolded states that determines the outcome on the folding stability.",

        "abstract": "An attempt has been made to design modified core-packing arrangements in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme. Alternative replacements of the buried residues Leu99, Met102, Val111 and Phe153 were selected using packing calculations and energy minimization. To test the design procedure, a series of multiple mutants was constructed culminating in the replacement L99F/M102L/V111I/F153L. These variants decrease the stability of T4 lysozyme by approximately 0 to 2 kcal/mol. The crystal structures of a number of the variants were determined. In the variant in which Val111 was replaced by Ile, alpha-helix 107-114 moved by approximately 1.5 A, breaking the hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl group of Thr109 and the backbone amide group of Gly113. This conformational change was not anticipated by the design procedure. Compensating interactions of magnitude up to 1.1 kcal/mol occur for some sets of mutations, while other sets display nearly additive stability changes. Within experimental error, the stability of the double mutant V111F/F153L is additive, with delta delta G different by only 0.1 kcal/mol from the sum of the two single mutants. The quadruple mutant L99F/M102L/V111I/F153L is destabilized by 0.5 kcal/mol, compared to delta delta G = -1.6 kcal/mol for the sum of the four single mutants. Multiple mutants show smaller overall structural changes from wild-type than M102L or V111I alone. Co-operative changes in structure and stability can be rationalized in terms of specific structural differences between single and multiple mutants. Genuine repacking of the hydrophobic core of T4 lysozyme with minimal effects on structure, stability and activity thus appears to have been achieved.",

        "abstract": "In general, alpha-helical conformations in proteins depend in large part on the amino acid residues within the helix and their proximal interactions. For example, an alanine residue has a high propensity to adopt an alpha-helical conformation, whereas that of a glycine residue is low. The sequence preferences for beta-sheet formation are less obvious. To identify the factors that influence beta-sheet conformation, a series of scanning polyalanine mutations were made within the strands and associated turns of the beta-sheet region in T4 lysozyme. For each construct the stability of the folded protein was reduced substantially, consistent with removal of native packing interactions. However, the crystal structures showed that each of the mutants retained the beta-sheet conformation. These results suggest that the structure of the beta-sheet region of T4 lysozyme is maintained to a substantial extent by tertiary interactions with the surrounding parts of the protein. Such tertiary interactions may be important in determining the structures of beta-sheets in general.",

        "abstract": "We have studied the denaturation of metmyoglobin at pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C by urea and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) which are known to unfold the protein to the same extent. It has been observed that estimates of protein stability (delta G0N-U) from urea-induced and GdnHCl-induced denaturations do not agree with one another; the linear extrapolation method gave delta G0N-U values of 7.59 +/- 0.33 and 5.35 +/- 0.10 kcal mol-1 for urea and GdnHCl denaturations, respectively. Measurements of the effect of the addition of KCl in the concentration range 0.1-1.0 M to urea denaturation have suggested that this disagreement is not due to the nonionic and ionic characters of urea and GdnHCl, respectively. The functional dependence of the free energy change of unfolding (delta GN-U) on [denaturant], the molar concentration of the denaturant, has been investigated for understanding the cause(s) of the disagreement between the two estimates of delta G0N-U of metmyoglobin. For this purpose, we have studied the GdnHCl-induced denaturation of the protein in the presence of different urea concentrations at pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C and vice versa. These measurements yield delta GN-U values in the full concentration range [Ahmad et al. (1994) J. Biochem. 115, 322-327], and these results provide strong evidence that the delta GN-U dependence on [urea] is linear (linear free energy model of denaturation) and the relation between delta GN-U and [GdnHCl] is curved (binding model of denaturation). It has been observed that the extrapolated value of delta GN-U in urea using the linear free energy model becomes identical to the extrapolated value of delta GN-U in GdnHCl using the binding model.",

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding of xylanase A from Streptomyces lividans, and of its isolated substrate binding and catalytic domains, was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our calorimetric studies show that the thermal denaturation of the intact enzyme is a complex process consisting of two endothermic events centered near 57 and 64 degrees C and an exothermic event centered near 75 degrees C, all of which overlap slightly on the temperature scale. A comparison of the data obtained with the intact enzyme and isolated substrate binding and catalytic domains indicate that the lower- and higher-temperature endothermic events are attributable to the thermal unfolding of the xylan binding and catalytic domains, respectively, whereas the higher-temperature exothermic event arises from the aggregation and precipitation of the denatured catalytic domain. Moreover, the thermal unfolding of the two domains of the native enzyme are thermodynamically independent and differentially sensitive to pH. The unfolding of the substrate binding domain is a reversible two-state process and, under appropriate conditions, the refolding of this domain to its native conformation can occur. In contrast, the unfolding of the catalytic domain is a more complex process in which two subdomains unfold independently over a similar temperature range. Also, the unfolding of the catalytic domain leads to aggregation and precipitation, which effectively precludes the refolding of the protein to its native conformation. These observations are compatible with the results of our spectroscopic studies, which show that the catalytic and substrate binding domains of the enzyme are structurally dissimilar and that their native conformations are unaffected by their association in the intact enzyme. Thus, the calorimetric and spectroscopic data demonstrate that the S. lividans xylanase A consists of structurally dissimilar catalytic and substrate binding domains that, although covalently linked, undergo essentially independent thermal denaturation. These observations provide valuable new insights into the structure and thermal stability of this enzyme and should assist our efforts at engineering xylanases that are more thermally robust and otherwise better suited for industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "Assumptions about the dependence of protein unfolding on the concentration of urea have been examined by an extensive survey of the equilibrium unfolding of barnase and many of its mutants measured by urea denaturation and differential scanning calorimetry. The free energy of equilibrium unfolding and the activation energy for the kinetics of unfolding of proteins are generally assumed to change linearly with [urea]. A slight downward curvature is detected, however, in plots of highly precise measurements of logku versus [urea] (where ku is the observed rate constant for the unfolding of barnase). The data fit the equation logku = logkuH2O* + mku*.[urea] - 0.014[urea]2, where mku* is a variable which depends on the mutation. The constant 0.014 was measured directly on four destabilized mutants and wild-type, and was also determined from a global analysis of data from > 60 mutants of barnase. Any equivalent deviations from linearity in the equilibrium unfolding are small and in the same region, as determined from measurements on 166 mutants. The free energy of unfolding of barnase, delta GU-F, appears significantly larger by 1.6 kcal mol-1 when measured by calorimetry than when determined by urea denaturation. However, the changes in delta GU-F on mutation, delta delta GU-F, determined by calorimetry and by urea denaturation are identical. We show analytically how, in general, the curvature in plots of activation or equilibrium energies against [denaturant] should not affect the changes of these values on mutation provided measurements are made over the same concentration ranges of denaturant and the curvature is independent of mutation.",

The dimerization interface of EF-Ts is composed of two antiparallel beta-sheets that can be connected by an intermolecular disulfide bond. The stability of EF-Ts from T. thermophilus in the presence and absence of the intermolecular disulfide bond was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism. The ratio of the van't Hoff and calorimetric enthalpies, delta H(vH)/delta H(cal), indicates that EF-Ts undergoes thermal unfolding as a dimer independently of the presence or absence of the disulfide bond. This can be concluded from (1) the presence of residual secondary structure above the thermal transition temperature, (2) the absence of concentration dependence, which would be expected for dissociation of the dimer prior to unfolding of the monomers, and (3) a relatively low heat capacity change (delta Cp) upon unfolding. The retained dimeric structure of the thermally denatured state allowed for the determination of the effect of the intermolecular disulfide bond on the conformational stability of EF-Ts, which is deltadelta G(S-S,SH HS) = 10.5 kJ/mol per monomer at 72.5 degrees C. The possible physiological implications of the dimeric EF-Ts structure and of the intersubunit disulfide bond for the extreme conformational stability of proteins in thermophiles are discussed.",

All wild-type and mutant forms fold through a rapidly formed intermediate state that precedes the rate-limiting transition state. Mutations have a pronounced effect on the enthalpy of both the intermediate and folded states, but in all cases a compensatory change in entropy results in a small net free-energy change. While the enthalpy change in the folded state can be attributed to a loss of van der Waals interactions, it has already been shown that changes in the stability of the intermediate are dominated by changes in secondary structure propensity [Lorch et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 1377-1385]. It follows that the thermodynamic basis of beta-propensity is enthalpic in origin. The effects of mutations on the enthalpy and entropy of the transition state are smaller than on the ground states. This relative insensitivity to mutation is discussed in the light of theories concerning the nature of the rate-limiting barrier in folding reactions.",

        "abstract": "Human lysozyme has four disulfide bonds, one of which, Cys65-Cys81, is included in a long loop of the beta-domain. A cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in which the position of Cys65 was shifted within a continuous segment from positions 61 to 67, with fixed Cys81, has previously shown that only the mutant W64CC65A, which has a nonnative Cys64-Cys81 disulfide, can be correctly folded and secreted by yeast. Here, using the W64CC65A mutant, we investigated the effects of an alternative disulfide bond on the structure, stability, and folding of human lysozyme using circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with a stopped-flow technique. Although the mutant is expected to have a different main-chain structure from that of the wild-type protein around the loop region, far- and near-UV CD spectra show that the native state of the mutant has tightly packed side chains and secondary structure similar to that of the wild-type. Guanidine hydrochloride-induced equilibrium unfolding transition of the mutant is reversible, showing high stability and cooperativity of folding. In the kinetic folding reaction, both proteins accumulate a similar burst-phase intermediate having pronounced secondary structure within the dead time of the measurement and fold into the native structure by means of a similar folding mechanism. Both the kinetic refolding and unfolding reactions of the mutant protein are faster than those of the wild-type, but the increase in the unfolding rate is larger than that of the refolding rate. The Gibbs' free-energy diagrams obtained from the kinetic analysis suggest that the structure around the loop region in the beta-domain of human lysozyme is formed after the transition state of folding, and thus, the effect of the alternative disulfide bond on the structure, stability, and folding of human lysozyme appears mainly in the native state.",

        "abstract": "A member of the family of hematopoietic cytokines human prolactin (hPRL) is a 23k kDa polypeptide hormone, which displays pH dependence in its structural and functional properties. The binding affinity of hPRL for the extracellular domain of its receptor decreases 500-fold over the relatively narrow, physiologic pH range from 8 to 6; whereas, the affinity of human growth hormone (hGH), its closest evolutionary cousin, does not. Similarly, the structural stability of hPRL decreases from 7.6 to 5.6 kcal/mol from pH 8 to 6, respectively, whereas the stability of hGH is slightly increased over this same pH range. hPRL contains nine histidines, compared with hGH's three, and they are likely responsible for hPRL's pH-dependent behavior. We have systematically mutated each of hPRL's histidines to alanine and measured the effect on pH-dependent global stability. Surprisingly, a vast majority of these mutations stabilize the native protein, by as much as 2-3 kcal/mol. Changes in the overall pH dependence to hPRL global stability can be rationalized according to the predominant structural interactions of individual histidines in the hPRL tertiary structure. Using double mutant cycles, we detect large interaction free energies within a cluster of nearby histidines, which are both stabilizing and destabilizing to the native state. Finally, by comparing the structural locations of hPRL's nine histidines with their homologous residues in hGH, we speculate on the evolutionary role of replacing structurally stabilizing residues with histidine to introduce pH dependence to cytokine function.",

        "abstract": "The Arc-MYL variant is hyperstable and has an earlier transition state than wild type as a consequence of replacing the wild-type salt-bridge triad formed by R31, E36 and R40 with hydrophobic interactions formed by M31, Y36 and L40. Amino acid substitution mutations were constructed at 16 positions in the Arc-MYL background and the equilibrium stabilities of the corresponding mutant proteins were determined. At three positions, mutations were found to be less destabilizing in MYL than in wild-type Arc, and, at one position, the opposite result was obtained. The kinetics of refolding and unfolding were determined for a subset of the Arc-MYL core mutants. Three mutations--VA18, LA19 and LA40--had their major energetic effects on the refolding rate. The interactions perturbed by these mutations appear to be substantially formed in the transition state. V18 and L19 are in the N-terminal turn of helix A and L40 is in the center of helix B. The remaining mutations--VA22, MA31, VA33, YA36, VA41, MA42 and FA45--had some effects on refolding but exerted their major effects on the unfolding rate. Approximately 30% of the energetic interactions mediated by these latter side chains seem to be present in the transition state of Arc-MYL.",

        "abstract": "To better understand the relation between sequence and structure, and in an attempt to simplify the protein folding problem, a series of alanine substitutions was introduced into bacteriophage T4 lysozyme. In contrast to previous studies in this system, which were restricted to single alpha-helices, the present analysis included a helix-turn-helix region, a loop-helix region, and two alpha-helices that were well separated in the three-dimensional structure. It was shown previously that T4 lysozyme is very tolerant of alanine substitutions within alpha-helices, especially at solvent-exposed sites. The present study shows that the protein is also tolerant of such substitutions in turn and loop regions, although less than in helices. The results confirm that the structural information in the amino acid sequence is highly redundant. For example, the protein with the sequence 127AAAAAALAAAAWAAA141 folds normally, has melting temperature only 0.8 degrees C lower than wildtype, and has a crystal structure that is also very similar to wildtype. Polyalanine substitutions within turns or loops can, however, lead to differences in structure and in folding. In one example the triple substitution K35A/S36A/P37A caused this region of the molecule to change to a more helical conformation. In a second case the mutant with the sequence 34AAAAALAAAKAALAAA49, which spans a loop-helix region, had a dramatically altered thermal unfolding transition, suggesting that this region may tend to form a single, uninterrupted, helix. Substitution of Ala38 in the above construct with aspartic acid caused the unfolding to be more like wildtype, suggesting that residue 38, which is at a helix-capping position in the wildtype structure, provides an initiation signal that is essential in the polyalanine mutant for the correct formation of alpha-helix 39-50. In a typical protein, the information that codes for the 3D structure is presumably distributed over many amino acids. The present results suggest that in simplified sequences the key folding information may be restricted to a subset of critical residues, and so be more readily accessible to experimental analysis.",

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin head fragments with alterations in the actin-binding surface loop 2 was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Lengthening of loop 2 without concomitant charge changes led to decreases in the transition temperature of not more than 1.8 degrees C. Insertions with multiple positive or negative charges had a stronger destabilizing effect and led to reductions in the thermal transition temperature of up to 3.7 degrees C. In the presence of nucleotide, most mutants displayed similar or higher transition temperatures than M765. Only constructs M765(11/+6) and M765(20/+12) with long positively charged inserts showed transition temperatures that were more than 2 degrees C below the values measured for M765 in the presence of ADP, ADP-V(i), and ADP-BeF(3). Interaction with F-actin in the presence of ADP shifted the thermal transition of M765 by 6 degrees C, from 49.1 to 55.1 degrees C. The actin-induced increase in thermal stability varied between 1.2 and 9.1 degrees C and showed a strong correlation with the mutant constructs' affinity for actin. Our results show that length and charge changes in loop 2 do not significantly affect nucleotide-induced structural changes in the myosin motor domain, but they affect structural changes that occur when the motor domain is strongly bound to actin and affect the coupling between the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites.",

(1989) Biochemistry 28, 362] have proposed that the N'/N and U/U* structural differences involve cis/trans isomerization about the Lys116-Pro117 peptide bond with N and U cis and N' and U* trans. The present results show that residue changes throughout the nuclease structure have large effects on the distribution of the N and N'forms. The N'/N ratios at 313 K for nuclease H124L (N'/N = 0.07) and nuclease G79S (N'/N = 12) differ by 2 orders of magnitude. Thermodynamic parameters for equilibria linking the two folded and two unfolded substates were evaluated for seven mutants of nuclease which were found by kinetic assays to have similar enzymatic activities but by NMR spectroscopy to have a wide dispersion of thermal stabilities. Our results indicate that mutational perturbations of the N'/N equilibrium in folded nuclease (delta G for the N in equilibrium N' reaction) are strongly coupled to changes in the stability of the N form (delta G for the N in equilibrium U reaction), but much less so to the stability of the N' form (delta G for the N' in equilibrium U* reaction).",

        "abstract": "Kinetics of unfolding and refolding of rabbit muscle triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) were measured as a function of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) concentration. From the rate constants of these processes, the activation free-energy barriers (delta G++) were calculated using the Arrhenius equation. Assuming a linear dependence of delta G++ on the concentration of GdnHCl, activation energies in the absence of GdnHCl were estimated. The Gibbs free-energy change of dissociation/unfolding (delta G) was determined from GdnHCl unfolding curves in equilibrium. Using these data and the literature value for the bimolecular association rate constant of folded TIM monomers [Zabori, S., Rudolph, R., and Jaenicke, R. (1980) Z. Naturforsch. 35C, 999-1004], a model was developed that fully describes both kinetics and energetics of subunit dissociation/unfolding of TIM. Unfolded TIM monomers are susceptible to proteolytic digestion and thiol oxidation, while native TIM is resistant to both. The present model explains how the dimeric nature of TIM decreases the frequency of subunit unfolding by several orders of magnitude, thus increasing the chemical stability of the protein. Furthermore, the model also explains the recently demonstrated persistence (on a time scale of hours to days) of conformational heterogeneity of native TIM dimers [Rietveld, A. W. M., and Ferreira, S. T. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 7743-7751]. Again, it appears that the dimeric nature of TIM is essential for this behavior.",

Yeast expressing a partial loop deletion do not contain perceptible amounts of holoprotein as measured by low-temperature spectroscopy and cannot grow on nonfermentable media. Strains expressing loop replacement mutations accumulate holoprotein in vivo, but the protein function varies depending on the sequence and length of the replacement loop; in vivo expression levels do not correlate with their thermal denaturation temperatures. In vitro spectroscopic studies of the loop replacement proteins indicate that all fold into a native-like cytochrome c conformation, but are less stable than the wild-type protein. Decreases in thermal stability are caused by perturbation of loop C backbone in one case and a slight reorganization of the protein hydrophobic core in another case, rather than rearrangement of the loop A backbone. A single-site mutation in one of the replacement mutants designed to relieve inefficient hydrophobic core packing caused by the new loop recovers some, but not all, of the lost stability.",

To understand protein thermostability at the molecular level we studied a pair of cold shock proteins, one of mesophilic and one of thermophilic origin, by systematic mutagenesis. Although the two proteins differ in sequence at 12 positions, two surface-exposed residues are responsible for the increase in stability of the thermophilic protein (by 15.8 kJ mol-1 at 70 degrees C). 11.5 kJ mol-1 originate from a predominantly electrostatic contribution of Arg 3 and 5.2 kJ mol-1 from hydrophobic interactions of Leu 66 at the carboxy terminus. The mesophilic protein could be converted to a highly thermostable form by changing the Glu residues at positions 3 and 66 to Arg and Leu, respectively. The variation of surface residues may thus provide a simple and powerful approach for increasing the thermostability of a protein.",

        "abstract": "The thermotropic behavior of purified human complement protein C9 was investigated by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. When dissolved in physiological buffers (pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl), C9 underwent three endothermic transitions with transition temperatures (Tm) centered at about 32, 48, and 53 degrees C, respectively, and one exothermic transition above 64 degrees C that correlated with protein aggregation. The associated calorimetric enthalpies of the three endothermic transitions were about 45, 60, and 161 kcal/mol with cooperative ratios (delta Hcal/delta HvH) close to unity. The total calorimetric enthalphy for the unfolding process was in the range of 260-280 kcal/mol under all conditions. The exothermic aggregation temperature was strongly pH dependent, changing from 60 degrees C at pH 6.6 to 81.4 degrees C at pH 8.0, whereas none of the three endothermic transitions was significantly affected by pH changes. They were, however, sensitive to addition of calcium ions; most affected was Tm1 which shifted from 32 to 35.8 degrees C in the presence of 3 mM calcium, i.e., the normal blood concentration. Kosmotropic ions stabilized the protein by shifting the endothermic transitions to slightly higher temperatures whereas inclusion of chaotropic ions (such as choline), removal of bound calcium by addition of EDTA, or proteolysis with thrombin lowered the transition temperatures. Previous studies had indicated the formation of at least three different forms of C9 during membrane insertion or during heat polymerization, and it is suggested that the three endothermic transitions reflect the formation of such C9 conformers. Choline, which is present at high concentrations on the surface of biological membranes, and calcium ions have the ability to shift the transition temperatures of the first two transitions to be either close to or below body temperature. Thus, it is very likely that C9 is present in vivo in a partially unfolded state when bound to a membrane surface, and we propose that this facilitates membrane insertion and refolding of the protein into an amphiphilic conformation.",

Mutants of this enzyme were produced, carrying additional weak interactions found in thermostable alpha-amylases. It is shown that single amino acid side chain substitutions can significantly modify the melting point T(m), the calorimetric enthalpy Delta H(cal), the cooperativity and reversibility of unfolding, the thermal inactivation rate constant, and the kinetic parameters k(cat) and K(m). The correlation between thermal inactivation and unfolding reversibility displayed by the mutants also shows that stabilizing interactions increase the frequency of side reactions during refolding, leading to intramolecular mismatches or aggregations typical of large proteins. Although all mutations were located far from the active site, their overall trend is to decrease both k(cat) and K(m) by rigidifying the molecule and to protect mutants against thermal inactivation. The effects of these mutations indicate that the cold-adapted alpha-amylase has lost a large number of weak interactions during evolution to reach the required conformational plasticity for catalysis at low temperatures, thereby producing an enzyme close to the lowest stability allowing maintenance of the native conformation.",

        "abstract": "G41 is an interfacial residue located within the alpha-helix 34-42 of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). Its mutations on the major (AGT-Ma) or the minor (AGT-Mi) allele give rise to the variants G41R-Ma, G41R-Mi, and G41V-Ma causing hyperoxaluria type 1. Impairment of dimerization in these variants has been suggested to be responsible for immunoreactivity deficiency, intraperoxisomal aggregation, and sensitivity to proteasomal degradation. However, no experimental evidence supports this view. Here we report that G41 mutations, besides increasing the dimer-monomer equilibrium dissociation constant, affect the protein conformation and stability, and perturb its active site. As compared to AGT-Ma or AGT-Mi, G41 variants display different near-UV CD and intrinsic emission fluorescence spectra, larger exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, sensitivity to Met53-Tyr54 peptide bond cleavage by proteinase K, decreased thermostability, reduced coenzyme binding affinity, and catalytic efficiency. Additionally, unlike AGT-Ma and AGT-Mi, G41 variants under physiological conditions form insoluble inactive high-order aggregates (approximately 5,000 nm) through intermolecular electrostatic interactions. A comparative molecular dynamics study of the putative structures of AGT-Mi and G41R-Mi predicts that G41 --> R mutation causes a partial unwinding of the 34-42 alpha-helix and a displacement of the first 44 N-terminal residues including the active site loop 24-32. These simulations help us to envisage the possible structural basis of AGT dysfunction associated with G41 mutations. The detailed insight into how G41 mutations act on the structure-function of AGT may contribute to achieve the ultimate goal of correcting the effects of these mutations.",

To understand the structural determinants of this family of proteins and extract the consensus information that defines the architecture of this motif, we have designed a series of idealized ankyrin repeat proteins containing one, two, three, or four repeats by using statistical analysis of approximately 4,000 ankyrin repeat sequences from the PFAM database. Biophysical and x-ray crystallographic studies of the three and four repeat constructs (3ANK and 4ANK) to 1.26 and 1.5 A resolution, respectively, demonstrate that these proteins are well-folded, monomeric, display high thermostability, and adopt a very regular, tightly packed ankyrin repeat fold. Mapping the degree of amino acid conservation at each position on the 4ANK structure shows that most nonconserved residues are clustered on the surface of the molecule that has been designated as the binding site in naturally occurring ankyrin repeat proteins. Thus, the consensus amino acid sequence contains all information required to define the ankyrin repeat fold. Our results suggest that statistical analysis and the consensus sequence approach can be used as an effective method to design proteins with complex topologies. These generic ankyrin repeat proteins can serve as prototypes for dissecting the rules of molecular recognition mediated by ankyrin repeats and for engineering proteins with novel biological functions.",

These were constructed with varying-length interdomain peptide linkers of between 12 and 25 residues, expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein folding, stability, and antigen-binding characteristics were assessed. Efficient renaturation could be accomplished in vitro to yield approximately 26 mg of active scFv/L of fermentation. Scatchard analysis for fluorescein ligand binding revealed that the scFv designs come within 2-fold of the Ka = 1.99 (+/- 0.18) x 10(9) observed for the parental 4.4.20 Fab and have identical stoichiometries (n approximately 0.99). Reversible solvent denaturation studies demonstrated that the unfolding/refolding equilibria for the scFv proteins can be fit to a simple two-state model and that two of the scFv designs were found to be slightly more stable than single IgG domains (VL and CL) when assessed in terms of the free energy of unfolding, delta Gon-u, or nearly identical to other multiple domain immunoglobulin proteins such as light chains and Fab's when relative transition midpoints, Cm, are compared. Linkers which conferred conformational flexibility beyond the minimally required length of 12 residues were found to have a stabilizing effect.

The polypeptide chain retains a well-defined structure when the prosthetic heme group is removed from cytochrome b562. Circular dichroism measurements estimate 60% helicity for apocytochrome b562, compared with 80% helicity found in holocytochrome b562. At low pH, apocytochrome b562 displays a midpoint pH of 2.9, while ferricytochrome b562 displays a midpoint pH of 2.3. The unfolding of the apoprotein by urea and heat can be well approximated by the two-state transition model. The stability of apocytochrome b562 is significantly reduced from that of the holoprotein. The free energy of stabilization (delta G degrees) and the midpoint transition temperature (Tm) for apocytochrome b562 are found to be 3.2 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol and 52.3 +/- 0.9 degrees C, respectively, compared with 6.6 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol and 67.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C for ferricytochrome b562. The smaller heat capacity change upon unfolding of apocytochrome b562 than that of ferricytochrome b562, estimated from the thermodynamic parameters, indicates that apocytochrome b562 possesses a smaller hydrophobic core than holocytochrome b562. Size-exclusion chromatography studies indicate that the apoprotein is slightly more extended in molecular dimension than ferricytochrome b562. The data suggest that apocytochrome b562 resembles a \"molten globule\" or a \"collapsed form\" of the holoprotein, in which secondary structure formation is largely complete while the global folding is either only partially complete or dynamically expanded.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant mesophilic Escherichia coli (Ec) and thermophilic Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) elongation factors EF-Tus, their isolated G-domains, and six chimeric EF-Tus composed of domains of either EF-Tu were prepared, and their GDP/GTP binding activities and thermostability were characterized. BstEF-Tu and BstG-domain bound GDP and GTP with affinities in nanomolar and submicromolar ranges, respectively, fully comparable with those of EcEF-Tu. In contrast, the EcG-domain bound the nucleotides with much lower, micromolar affinities. The exchange of domains 2 and 3 had essentially no effect on the GDP-binding activity; all complexes of chimeric EF-Tus with GDP retained K(d) values in the nanomolar range. The final thermostability level of either EF-Tu was the result of a cooperative interaction between the G-domains and domains 2 + 3. The G-domains set up a \"basic\" level of the thermostability, which was approximately 20 degrees C higher with the BstG-domain than with the EcG-domain. This correlated with the growth temperature optimum difference of both bacteria and two distinct thermostabilization features of the BstG-domain: an increase of charged residues at the expense of polar uncharged residues (CvP bias), and a decrease in the nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area. Domains 2 + 3 contributed by further stabilization of alpha-helical regions and, in turn, the functions of the G-domains to the level of the respective growth temperature optima. Their contributions were similar irrespective of their origin but, with Ecdomains 2 + 3, dependent on the guanine nucleotide binding state. It was lower in the GTP conformation, and the mechanism involved the destabilization of the alpha-helical regions of the G-domain by Ecdomain 2.",

The free energy of urea-induced unfolding for the wild-type and seven mutant proteins has been measured. The mutant proteins have increased stability towards unfolding relative to the wild-type. The experimental results correlate reasonably well with theoretically calculated relative free energies of unfolding and show that electrostatic interactions between charges on the surface of a protein can have significant effects on protein stability.",

        "abstract": "Alpha-crystallin, the major eye lens protein, is a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in the suppression of protein aggregation and thus in the long-term maintenance of lens transparency. Zinc is a micronutrient of the eye, but its molecular interaction with alpha-crystallin has not been studied in detail. In this paper, we present results of in vitro experiments that show bivalent zinc specifically interacts with alpha-crystallin with a dissociation constant in the submillimolar range (Kd approximately 0.2-0.4 mM). We compared the effect of Zn2+ with those of Ca2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ at 1 mM on the structure and chaperoning ability of alpha-crystallin. An insulin aggregation assay showed that among the bivalent metal ions, only 1 mM Zn2+ improved the chaperone function of alpha-crystallin by 30% compared to that in the absence of bivalent metal ions. Addition of 1 mM Zn2+ increased the yield of alpha-crystallin-assisted refolding of urea-treated LDH to its native state from 33 to 38%, but other bivalent ions had little effect. The surface hydrophobicity of alpha-crystallin was increased by 50% due to the binding of Zn2+. In the presence of 1 mM Zn2+, the stability of alpha-crystallin was enhanced by 36 kJ/mol, and it became more resistant to tryptic cleavage. The implications of enhanced stability and molecular chaperone activity of alpha-crystallin in the presence of Zn2+ are discussed in terms of its role in the long-term maintenance of lens transparency and cataract formation.",

        "abstract": "Flavodoxin has been recently recognized as an essential protein for a number of pathogenic bacteria including Helicobacter pylori, where it has been proposed to constitute a target for antibacterial drug development. One way we are exploring to screen for novel inhibitory compounds is to perform thermal upshift assays, for which a detailed knowledge of protein thermostability and cofactor binding properties is of great help. However, very little is known on the stability and ligand binding properties of H. pylori flavodoxin, and its peculiar FMN binding site together with the variety of behaviors observed within the flavodoxin family preclude extrapolations. We have thus performed a detailed experimental and computational analysis of the thermostability and cofactor binding energetics of H. pylori flavodoxin, and we have found that the thermal unfolding equilibrium is more complex that any other previously described for flavodoxins as it involves the accumulation of two distinct equilibrium intermediates. Fortunately the entire stability and binding data can be satisfactorily fitted to a model, summarized in a simple phase diagram, where the cofactor only binds to the native state. On the other hand, we show how variability of thermal unfolding behavior within the flavodoxin family can be predicted using structure-energetics relationships implemented in the COREX algorithm. The different distribution and ranges of local stabilities of the Anabaena and H. pylori apoflavodoxins explain the essential experimental differences observed: much lower Tm1, greater resistance to global unfolding, and more pronounced cold denaturation in H. pylori. Finally, a new strategy is proposed to identify using COREX structural characteristics of equilibrium intermediate states populated during protein unfolding.",

        "abstract": "Insulin analogs designed to decrease self-association and increase absorption rates from subcutaneous tissue were found to have altered stability. Replacement of HB10 with aspartic acid increased stability while substitutions at B28 and/or B29 were either comparable to insulin or had decreased stability. The principal chemical degradation product of accelerated storage conditions was a disulfide-linked multimer that was formed through a disulfide interchange reaction which resulted from beta-elimination of the disulfides. The maintenance of the native state of insulin was shown to be important in protecting the disulfides from reduction by dithiothreitol and implicitly from the disulfide interchange reaction that occurs during storage. To understand how these amino acid changes alter chemical stability, the intramolecular conformational equilibria of each analog was assessed by equilibrium denaturation. The Gibbs free energy of unfolding was compared with the chemical stability during storage for over 20 analogs. A significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.8 and P less than 0.0005) exists between the conformational stability and chemical stability of these analogs, indicating that the chemical stability of insulin's disulfides is under the thermodynamic control of the conformational equilibria.",

At pH 7 in 30 mM PIPES buffer, the thermodynamic parameters are as follows: melting temperature, T1/2 = 48.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C; enthalpy change, delta H = 95.5 +/- 0.9 kcal mol-1; heat capacity change, delta Cp = 1.59 kcal mol-1 K-1; free energy change at 25 degrees C, delta G degrees (25 degrees C) = 5.6 kcal mol-1. Both T1/2 = 56.5 degrees C and delta H = 106.1 kcal mol-1 are maximal near pH 5. The conformational stability of ribonuclease T1 is increased by 3.0 kcal/mol in the presence of 0.6 M NaCl or 0.3 M MgCl2. This stabilization results mainly from the preferential binding of cations to the folded conformation of the protein. The estimates of the conformational stability of ribonuclease T1 from differential scanning calorimetry are shown to be in remarkably good agreement with estimates derived from an analysis of urea denaturation curves.",

        "abstract": "Charges are inherently incompatible with hydrophobic environments. Presumably for this reason, ionizable residues are usually excluded from the hydrophobic interior of proteins and are found instead at the surface, where they can interact with bulk water. Paradoxically, ionizable groups buried in the hydrophobic interior of proteins play essential roles, especially in biological energy transduction. To examine the unusual properties of internal ionizable groups we measured the pK(a) of glutamic acid residues at 25 internal positions in a stable form of staphylococcal nuclease. Two of 25 Glu residues titrated with normal pK(a) near 4.5; the other 23 titrated with elevated pK(a) values ranging from 5.2-9.4, with an average value of 7.7. Trp fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism were used to monitor the effects of internal charges on conformation. These data demonstrate that although charges buried in proteins are indeed destabilizing, charged side chains can be buried readily in the hydrophobic core of stable proteins without the need for specialized structural adaptations to stabilize them, and without inducing any major conformational reorganization. The apparent dielectric effect experienced by the internal charges is considerably higher than the low dielectric constants of hydrophobic matter used to represent the protein interior in electrostatic continuum models of proteins. The high thermodynamic stability required for proteins to withstand the presence of buried charges suggests a pathway for the evolution of enzymes, and it underscores the need to mind thermodynamic stability in any strategy for engineering novel or altered enzymatic active sites in proteins.",

Conversely, the G238S mutant's decreased stability might reflect an altered conformation of the active site and thus be related to the modified substrate profile. The relative stability of the R164S and R164H mutants is explained by the formation of a hydrogen bond between these residues and Asp-179 conferring a somewhat different structure to the omega loop and thus also explaining the extended substrate profile of these mutants. The loss of stability of the R164H mutant with increasing pH values can be explained by the titration of a hydrogen bond between the N delta of His-164 and the O delta of Asp-179. The properties of the G238S + E104K double mutant which is the most active against third-generation cephalosporins result from a balance of destabilizing and stabilizing substitutions, and their effects seem to be additive. The behavior of the R164S + E240K mutant might be explained on the basis of a similar compensation phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in human copper zinc superoxide dismutase (hSOD) that are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been proposed to destabilize the protein and thereby enhance toxic protein aggregation. In previous studies, denaturation of metallated (holo) hSODs was found to be irreversible, and complicated by the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Here, ALS-associated mutations (E100G, G93A, G85R and A4V) are introduced into a pseudo wild-type background containing no free cysteine residues. The guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation of the holo proteins is generally found to be highly reversible (except for A4V, which tended to aggregate), enabling quantitative analysis of the effects of the mutations on protein stability. Denaturation and renaturation curves were monitored by tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, enzyme activity, chemical cross-linking and analytical sedimentation, as a function of equilibration time and protein concentration. There is strong kinetic hysteresis, with curves requiring exceptionally long times (many days for pseudo wild-type) to reach equilibrium, and evidence for the formation of kinetic and equilibrium intermediate(s), which are more highly populated at lower protein concentrations. The effects of metal dissociation were included in the data fitting. The full protein concentration dependence is best described using a three-state model involving metallated native dimer, metallated monomeric intermediate and unfolded monomers with no bound metals; however, at high protein concentrations the unfolding approaches a two-state transition with metal binding to both the native dimers and unfolded monomers. We show that the E100G, G93A and G85R mutations decrease overall protein stability, largely by decreasing monomer stability with little effect on dimer dissociation. Comparison of the chemical denaturation data with ALS disease characteristics suggests that aggregation of some mutant hSOD may occur through increased population of partially folded states that are less stable than the monomeric intermediate and accessed from the destabilized holo protein.",

        "abstract": "The conformation and stability of Escherichia coli derived recombinant human interleukin 4 (rhuIL-4) have been examined by circular dichroism (CD). Protein unfolding was detected by ellipticity changes at 222 nm with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). The unfolding midpoint ([GdnHCl]1/2) was 3.7 M, the free energy of unfolding, (delta GDH2O), was 5.9 kcal/mol and the dependence of delta GD on the GdnHCl concentration (m) was 1.6 (kcal/mol)/M. This unfolding was demonstrated to be reversible upon removal of the GdnHCl by dialysis. Analysis of the far-UV CD spectrum indicated the presence of a high percentage of alpha-helical structure (ca. 73%). A small change in ellipticity was noted over the pH range 1.9-9.6, suggesting that the protein undergoes a minor conformational change with an apparent pKa of 4.17. Virtually complete biological activity, measured in vitro in a T-cell proliferation assay, was recovered following exposure to extreme values of pH (i.e., pH 3 and 10). An analysis of the near-UV CD spectrum indicated that the single tryptophan residue at position 91 was unconstrained and most likely exposed to the solvent. Titration with 4,4'-dithiodipyridine and 2-nitrothiosulfobenzoate established that the six cysteine residues in rhuIL-4 were involved in intramolecular disulfide linkages. These data support that rhuIL-4 has a highly stable three-dimensional structure.",

For Vfd it was found that mutants E95K, E94Q, F65Y, F65W, and T48A are quite similar to wt in stability. E94K is somewhat less stable, whereas E94D, F65A, F65I, R42A, and R42H are substantially less stable than wt. R42H is a substitution found in all Hfds, and NMR comparison of the Anabaena 7120 Vfd and Hfd showed the latter to be much less stable on the basis of hydrogen exchange rates (Chae YK, Abildgaard F, Mooberry ES, Markley JL, 1994, Biochemistry 33:3287-3295); we also find this to be true with respect to Gdn-HCl denaturation. Strikingly, the Hfd mutant H42R is more stable than the wt Hfd by precisely the amount of stability lost in Vfd upon mutating R42 to H (2.0 kcal/mol). On the basis of comparison of the X-ray crystal structures of wt Anabaena Vfd and Hfd, the decreased stabilities of F65A and F65I can be ascribed to increased solvent exposure of interior hydrophobic groups. In the case of Vfd mutants E94K and E94D, the decreased stabilities may result from disruption of a hydrogen bond between the E94 and S47 side chains. The instability of the R42 mutants is also most probably due to decreased hydrogen bonding capabilities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The urea-induced denaturation of HPr was monitored spectroscopically at fixed temperatures and thermal unfolding was performed in the presence of fixed concentrations of urea. These data were analyzed in several different ways to afford a measure of the cardinal parameters (delta Hg, Tg, delta Sg, and delta Cp) that describe the thermodynamics of folding for HPr. The method of Pace and Laurents (Pace CN, Laurents DV, 1989, Biochemistry 28:2520-2525) was used to estimate delta Cp as was a global analysis of the thermal- and urea-induced unfolding data. Each method used to analyze the data gives a similar value for delta Cp (1,170 +/- 50 cal mol-1K-1). Despite the high melting temperature for HPr (Tg = 73.5 degrees C), the maximum stability of the protein, which occurs at 26 degrees C, is quite modest (delta Gs = 4.2 kcal mol-1). In the presence of moderate concentrations of urea, HPr exhibits cold denaturation, and thus a complete stability curve for HPr, including a measure of delta Cp, can be achieved using the method of Chen and Schellman (Chen B, Schellman JA, 1989, Biochemistry 28:685-691). A comparison of the different methods for the analysis of solvent denaturation curves is provided and the effects of urea on the thermal stability of this small globular protein are discussed.

Phosphate, a physiological ligand, increases the stability against solvent denaturation by 3.5 kcal/mol. Generality of phosphate stabilization was shown by similar effects with other KBPAP ligands viz. adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), a nonhydrolyzable ligand, and arsenate, an inhibitor. The dissociation constant of phosphate obtained from denaturation curves matches with the dissociation constant estimated by conventional methods. The guanidinium chloride-mediated denaturation of KBPAP was monitored by several structural and functional parameters viz. activity, tryptophan fluorescence, 8-anilinonaphthalene 1-sulfonic acid binding, circular dichroism, and size exclusion chromatography, in the presence and absence of 10 mm phosphate. In the presence of phosphate, profiles of all the parameters shift to a higher guanidinium chloride concentration. Noncoincidence of these profiles in the absence of phosphate indicates multistate unfolding pathway for KBPAP; however, in the presence of phosphate, KBPAP unfolds with a single intermediate. Based on the crystal structure, we propose that the Arg258 may have an important role to play in stabilization mediated by phosphate.",

Usually, the hydrophobic Phe side chains are buried in folded proteins. We asked here whether the exposition of the essential Phe residues could be a cause for the very low conformational stability of CspB. Urea-induced and heat-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions were measured for three mutants of CspB, where Phe 15, Phe 17, and Phe 27 were individually replaced by alanine. Unexpectedly, all three mutations strongly destabilized CspB. The aromatic side chains of Phe 15, Phe 17, and Phe 27 in the active site are thus important for both binding to nucleic acids and conformational stability. There is no compromise between function and stability in the active site. Model calculations indicate that, although they are partially exposed to solvent, all three Phe residues nevertheless lose accessible surface upon folding, and this should favor the native state. A different result is obtained with the F38A variant. Phe 38 is hyperexposed in native CspB, and its substitution by Ala is in fact stabilizing.",

As more and more methionine residues are substituted into the protein, there is a progressive loss of stability. This is, however, increasingly offset in the selenomethionine variants, ultimately resulting in a differential increase in melting temperature of about 7 degrees C.

In order to determine the contribution of each of the two tryptophans to the fluorescence properties of the enzyme in the equilibrium transition and to characterize the hyperfluorescent form, two single tryptophan mutants in which tryptophans 308 and 333 were replaced by a tyrosine and a phenylalanine, respectively, were constructed. Neither the catalytic nor the physicochemical properties of the enzyme are significantly altered by these mutations. The unfolding-refolding transitions were studied using circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence emission. Both tryptophans contribute to the hyperfluorescence observed in the first transition. For guanidine hydrochloride concentrations higher than 0.9 M, it clearly appears that the second transition results from a further unfolding. It is accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a 5 mm red shift of the maximum emission wavelength. When the unfolding is induced by urea, the end of the transition corresponds to the hyperfluorescent state. Further addition of guanidine hydrochloride induces complete unfolding. These results suggest the presence of residual microstructures around tryptophan 308 and tryptophan 333 in the hyperfluorescent state.

        "abstract": "The conformational properties of streptokinase (SK) have been assessed by the techniques of differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism (CD), and through a combinational approach employing several algorithms which are predictive of secondary structural characteristics. In low ionic strength buffers, SK undergoes a reversible two-state thermal transition with a temperature of maximum heat capacity (Tm) of 46.1 +/- 0.9, a delta Hcal of 98 +/- 11 kcal/mol and a delta Hcal/delta HvH of approximately 1. In high ionic strength buffers, similar calorimetric properties were obtained with the exception that the delta Hcal/delta HvH values were considerably less than 1, indicating the existence of an additional irreversible thermally induced alteration in the molecule, most likely resulting in its aggregation. The effect of pH on the thermal unfolding properties of SK was determined. The results demonstrated that single two-state thermal transitions were obtained, with progressively decreasing Tm values, as the pH was reduced from 6.4 to 3.4, indicating a destabilization of the entire molecule at reduced pH. In the alkaline region, between pH 8.4 and 9.4, stabilization of a separate region of the molecule was obtained, as evidenced by an increase in the delta Hcal/delta HvH to values approximating 2. CD analysis was performed in order to estimate secondary structural characteristics of SK. The best fit of secondary structural parameters to the experimental CD spectrum provided estimates of 17% helices, 28% beta-sheet, 21% beta-turns, and 34% disordered structures. Both the intensity of the spectral band at 208 nm and the level of antiparallel beta-sheet strongly suggest that SK is an alpha + beta protein.",

        "title": "Structures of randomly generated mutants of T4 lysozyme show that protein stability can be enhanced by relaxation of strain and by improved hydrogen bonding via bound solvent.", 
        "abstract": "The structures of three mutants of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme selected using a screen designed to identify thermostable variants are described. Each of the mutants has a substitution involving threonine. Two of the variants, Thr 26-->Ser (T26S) and Thr 151-->Ser (T151S), have increased reversible melting temperatures with respect to the wild-type protein. The third, Ala 93-->Thr (A93T), has essentially the same stability as wild type. Thr 26 is in the wall of the active-site cleft. Its replacement with serine results in the rearrangement of nearby residues, most notably Tyr 18, suggesting that the increase in stability may result from the removal of strain. Thr 151 in the wild-type structure is far from the active site and appears to sterically prevent the access of solvent to a preformed binding site. In the mutant, the removal of the methyl group allows access to the solvent binding site and, in addition, the Ser 151 hydroxyl rotates to a new position so that it also contributes to solvent binding. Residue 93 is in a highly exposed site on the surface of the molecule, and presumably is equally solvent exposed in the unfolded protein. It is, therefore, not surprising that the substitution Ala 93-->Thr does not change stability. The mutant structures show how chemically similar mutations can have different effects on both the structure and stability of the protein, depending on the structural context. The results also illustrate the power of random mutagenesis in obtaining variants with a desired phenotype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "For the first time completely reversible unfolding was achieved for guanidinium chloride-denatured rhodanese using a systematically defined protocol. These conditions included beta-mercaptoethanol, lauryl maltoside, and sodium thiosulfate. All components were required to get more than the previous best reactivation with lauryl maltoside of 17% (Tandon, S., and Horowitz, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15615-15681). Non-coincidental transition curves were obtained by monitoring different parameters including: (i) variation in the activity, (ii) shifts of the fluorescence wavelength maximum, and (iii) variation in ellipticity at 220 nm. The transition followed by the fluorescence wavelength maximum was asymmetric and resolvable into two separate transitions. A thermodynamic analysis was used to define the energetics of the two processes. Studies with the fluorescent \"apolar\" probe 1,8ANS are consistent with the appearance of organized hydrophobic surfaces following the first transition. Near UV CD measurements indicated that the first transition is associated with a loss of dyssymmetry around at least some of the tryptophans. Thus, the unfolding of rhodanese is complex, and there are detectable intermediate(s) during the process. These results suggest that reversible unfolding occurs in two discrete stages: 1) loss of tertiary interactions and activity, with retention of secondary structure, and 2) loss of secondary structure. The available x-ray structure suggests that the first transition can be associated with changes in the domain interactions, which may modulate the effectiveness of helix dipoles in lowering the pKa of the active site sulfhydryl.",

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding of the plastocyanin from Phormidium laminosum, a thermophilic cyanobacterium, is herein described. The main objective of this work is to identify structural factors responsible for the higher stability observed in proteins from thermophilic organisms. With the aid of fluorescence spectroscopy, EPR, and NMR, the factors influencing the unfolding process of the protein were investigated, and procedures for its study have been standardized. The different spectroscopic techniques used provided consistent results showing that the thermal unfolding of plastocyanin is irreversible under all the conditions investigated and that this irreversibility does not appear to be related to the presence of oxygen. The oxidized plastocyanin species has proven to be more stable than the reduced one, with respect to both the required temperature for protein unfolding (up to a 9 degrees C difference between the two forms) and the kinetics of the process. The behavior of this plastocyanin contrasts with that of other cupredoxins whose unfolding had previously been studied. The unfolding pH dependence and kinetic studies indicate a process with a tight control around the physiological pH in which plastocyanin plays its redox role and the protein's isoelectric point (5.2), suggesting a close compromise between function and stability.",

The enzyme is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 31,500 +/- 1000, a molecular Stokes radius of 21.5 A, and a diffusion coefficient of 8.7 X 10(-7) cm2/s. The frictional ratio of the native enzyme (1.05) suggests that the shape of the molecule is nearly spherical. Denaturation experiments performed with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) at neural pH indicated that the active site of the enzyme was destroyed by a structural rearrangement of the protein molecule without large change in its size and shape. The final state reached in 6.0 M Gdn . HCl seemed to correspond to a disulfide cross-linked randomly coiled polypeptide. Full normalization of the fluorescent parameter was attained only in the presence of 0.1 M beta-mercaptoethanol. A structural rearrangement has been observed upon acidification of INMT from pH 7.0 to pH 2.0. At pH 4.5, most of the peptide backbone appeared to be unorganized, but further acidification to pH 2.0 produced a reorganization of protein structure which became able to bind 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate.

The secondary structure and the backbone dynamics of this mutant were characterized using multidimensional NMR. Consistent with the prediction, the N-terminal region of the mutant was found to be unfolded while other parts of the proteins remained folded.

        "abstract": "Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase) is a dimeric protein with two identical subunits linked by two disulfide bridges, each subunit showing 80% of sequence identity with pancreatic RNase A. BS-RNase exists in two different quaternary conformations in solution: the MxM form, in which each subunit exchanges its alpha-helical N-terminal segment with its partner, and the M=M form with no exchange. By differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC), the denaturation of the two dimeric forms of BS-RNase was found to be more complex than a simple two-state process. Monomeric derivatives of the dimeric protein follow instead a simple two-state mechanism, but are distinctly less stable than RNase A. The three-state N if I if D denaturation process of the two quaternary isoforms was interpreted by identifying in the dimers a central highly structured core, enclosing the covalently bonded subunit interface, which unfolds only after the periphery (mainly the N-terminal peptide) unfolds. Circular dichroism spectra of the two forms in the far-ultraviolet region show large differences between the secondary structure of the isoforms and that of the native BS-RNase mixture at equilibrium. This has been attributed to the presence in the equilibrium mixture of intermediate forms with displaced and disordered N-terminal alpha-helical segments.",

The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation of these mutant proteins were examined by differential scanning calorimetry and were compared with that of the wild-type protein. Three mutants with the extra residue were significantly destabilized: the changes in unfolding Gibbs energy (DeltaDeltaG) were -9.1 to -12.2 kJ.mol-1. However, the stability of two single substitutions at the N-terminal slightly decreased; the DeltaDeltaG values were only -0.5 to -2.5 kJ.mol-1. The results indicate that human lysozyme is destabilized by an expanded N-terminal residue. The crystal structural analyses of K1M, K1A and Gly(-1) revealed that the introduction of a residue at the N-terminal of human lysozyme caused the destruction of hydrogen bond networks with ordered water molecules, resulting in the destabilization of the protein.",

        "abstract": "Experiments with cytochrome c (cyt c) show that an initial folding event, molecular collapse, is not an energetically downhill continuum as commonly presumed but represents a large-scale, time-consuming, cooperative barrier-crossing process. In the absence of later misfold-reorganization barriers, the early collapse barrier limits cyt c folding to a time scale of milliseconds. The collapse process itself appears to be limited by an uphill search for some coarsely determined transition state structure that can nucleate subsequent energetically downhill folding events. An earlier \"burst phase\" event at strongly native conditions appears to be a non-specific response of the unfolded chain to reduced denaturant concentration. The molecular collapse process may or may not require the co-formation of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal helices, which are present in an initial metastable intermediate directly following the rate-limiting collapse. After the collapse-nucleation event, folding can proceed rapidly in an apparent two-state manner, probably by way of a predetermined sequence of metastable intermediates that leads to the native protein structure (Bai et al., Science 269:192-197, 1995).",

        "abstract": "The transcriptional coactivator and acetyltransferase CREB Binding Protein (CBP) is comprised of several autonomously folded and functionally independent domains. The KIX domain mediates interactions between CBP and numerous transcriptional activators. The folded region of KIX has all the structural features of a globular protein, including three alpha-helices, two short 3(10) helices, and a well-packed hydrophobic core. KIX contains a buried cation-pi interaction between the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg 600 and the aromatic ring of Tyr 640. Arg 600 is a site for regulatory methylation by CARM1/PRMT4, which negates the CREB-binding function of the KIX domain. The role of the Arg 600-Tyr 640 buried polar interaction in specifying and stabilizing the structure of KIX was investigated by comparing the folding of wild-type KIX with the single point mutants Y640F and R600M. The Y640F mutant disrupts a hydrogen bond involving the Tyr 640 OH and the backbone of V595 but still allows for the cation-pi interaction while the R600M mutant disrupts the cation-pi interaction. Both wild type KIX and Y640F exhibit properties expected of native like, globular proteins such as a single oligomerization state (monomer), cooperative thermal and urea-induced unfolding transitions, and a well-packed core. In contrast, the R600M mutant has properties reminiscent of a molten globule state, including a tendency to aggregate, noncooperative thermal unfolding transition, and a loosely packed core. Thus, the buried cation-pi interaction is critical for specifying the unique cooperatively folded structure of KIX.",

        "abstract": "High-precision differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) have been employed to study the thermal unfolding of chitinase 40 (Chi40) from Streptomyces thermoviolaceus. Chi40 belongs to family 18 of glycosyl hydrolase superfamily bearing a catalytic domain with a \"TIM barrel\"-like fold, which exhibits deviations from the (beta/alpha)8 fold. The thermal unfolding is reversible at pH = 8.0 and 9.0. The denatured state is characterized by extensive structural changes with respect to the native. The process is characterized by slow relaxation kinetics. Even slower refolding rates are recorded upon cooling. It is shown that the denaturation calorimetric data obtained at slow heating rate (0.17 K/min) are in excellent agreement with equilibrium data obtained by extrapolation of the experimental results to zero scanning rate. Analysis of the DSC results reveals that the experimental data can be successfully fitted using either a non-two-state sequential model involving one equilibrium intermediate, or an independent transitions model involving the unfolding of two Chi40 energetic domains to intermediate states. The stability of the native state with respect to the final denatured state is estimated, deltaG = 24.0 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C. The thermal results are in agreement with previous findings from chemical denaturation studies of a wide variety of (beta/alpha)8 barrel proteins, that their unfolding is a non-two-state process, always involving at least one unfolding intermediate.",

Denaturation by guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) is rapid and completely reversible. Reduction of disulphide bridges in the folded proteins by beta-mercaptoethanol leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence intensity of the folded proteins is approximately 7.5% of that of the respective unfolded proteins. The data can be approximated to a two-state transition between native and denatured forms of the proteins.

        "abstract": "Experimental and theoretical double-mutant cycles have been used to investigate a salt bridge in the N-terminal domain of the protein L9. Aspartic acid 23 is the only acidic residue involved in a well-defined pairwise interaction, namely, a partially solvent-exposed salt bridge with the protonated N-terminus of the protein. Mutations were studied in which Asp 23 was substituted by alanine, asparagine, and nitrile alanine. Interactions with the N-terminus were probed by comparisons between proteins with a protonated and acetylated N-terminus. The mutants were all folded, and the structures were unchanged from wild type as judged by CD and 2-D NMR. The coupling free energy between the N-terminus and the side chain of Asp 23 measured through double-mutant cycle analysis was favorable and ranged from -0.7 to -1.7 kcal mol(-)(1), depending upon the set of mutants used. This relatively large coupling free energy for a surface salt bridge likely arises from geometric factors that reduce the entropy loss associated with salt-bridge formation and from structural relaxation in the mutants. Coupling free energies computed with continuum electrostatic calculations agreed well with the experimental values when full account was taken of all potential interactions, particularly those involving Asp 23 and the acetylated N-terminus as well as interactions with solvent. The measured and calculated coupling free energy decreased only slightly when the salt concentration was increased from 100 to 750 mM NaCl. The calculations suggest that the coupling free energy between D23 and the N-terminus measured through the experimental double-mutant cycle analysis is significantly smaller than the actual interaction free energy between the groups in the wild-type structure because of the inapplicability of assumptions frequently used to interpret double-mutant cycles.",

From the equilibrium constant as a function of pressure and temperature all of the involved thermodynamic parameters of protein folding, in particular the changes in entropy and volume, compressibility, thermal expansion, and specific heat, were deduced in a global fitting procedure. Assuming that these parameters are independent of temperature and pressure, we can demonstrate from the ratio of Deltabeta, Deltaalpha(2), DeltaC(p) that the phase diagram of protein folding assumes an elliptic shape. Furthermore, we can show that the thermodynamic condition for such an elliptic phase diagram is related to the degree of correlation between the fluctuations of the changes in volume and enthalpy at the phase boundary. For the protein investigated this correlation is low, as generally expected for highly degenerate systems. Our study suggests that the elliptic phase diagram is a consequence of the inherent conformational disorder of proteins and that it may be viewed as the thermodynamic manifestation of the high degeneracy of conformational energies that is characteristic for this class of macromolecules.",

By determining the high-resolution structure of CP13* and characterizing its energy landscape using native state hydrogen exchange (NSHX), we show that connectivity between the subdomains is an important determinant of the energetic cooperativity but not structural integrity of the protein. The circular permutation results in a protein more easily able to populate a partially unfolded form in which the C-terminal subdomain is folded and the N-terminal subdomain is unfolded. We also created a fragment model of this intermediate and demonstrate using X-ray crystallography that its structure is identical to the corresponding residues in the full-length protein with the exception of a small network of hydrophobic interactions. In sum, we conclude that the C-terminal subdomain dominates the energetics of T4 lysozyme folding, and the A-helix serves an important role in coupling the two subdomains.",

        "abstract": "Intermediates along a protein's folding pathway can play an important role in its biology. Previous kinetics studies have revealed an early folding intermediate for T4 lysozyme, a small, well-characterized protein composed of an N-terminal and a C-terminal subdomain. Pulse-labeling hydrogen exchange studies suggest that residues from both subdomains contribute to the structure of this intermediate. On the other hand, equilibrium native state hydrogen experiments have revealed a high-energy, partially unfolded form of the protein that has an unstructured N-terminal subdomain and a structured C-terminal subdomain. To resolve this discrepancy between kinetics and equilibrium data, we performed detailed kinetics analyses of the folding and unfolding pathways of T4 lysozyme, as well as several point mutants and large-scale variants. The data support the argument for the presence of two distinct intermediates, one present on each side of the rate-limiting transition state barrier. The effects of circular permutation and site-specific mutations in the wild-type and circular permutant background, as well as a fragment containing just the C-terminal subdomain, support a model for the unfolding intermediate with an unfolded N-terminal and a folded C-terminal subdomain. Our results suggest that the partially unfolded form identified by native state hydrogen exchange resides on the folded side of the rate-limiting transition state and is, therefore, under most conditions, a \"hidden\" intermediate.",

        "abstract": "Thermally induced transition curves of hen egg-white lysozyme were measured in the presence of several concentrations of dextran at pH 2.0 by near-UV and far-UV CD. The transition curves were fitted to a two-state model by a non-linear, least-squares method to obtain the transition temperature (T(m)), enthalpy change (deltaH(u)(T(m))), and free energy change (deltaG(u)(T)) of the unfolding transition. An increase in T(m) and almost constant deltaH(u)(T(m)) values were observed in the presence of added dextran at concentrations exceeding ca 100 g l(-1). In addition, dextran-induced conformational changes of fully unfolded protein were investigated by CD spectroscopy. Addition of high concentrations of dextran to solutions of acid-unfolded cytochrome c at pH 2.0 results in a shift of the CD spectrum from that characteristic of the fully unfolded polypeptide to that characteristic of the more compact, salt-induced molten globule state, a result suggesting that the molten globule-like state is stabilized relative to the fully unfolded form in crowded environments. Both observations are in qualitative accord with predictions of a previously proposed model for the effect of intermolecular excluded volume (macromolecular crowding) on protein stability and conformation.",

More recent evidence has indicated that such a structure for the intermediate seems unlikely. In this report, single Trp residues (absent in the wild-type alpha-subunit) are substituted separately for Phe residues at positions 139 (in alpha-1) and 258 (in alpha-2) to produce the F139W, F258W, and F139W/F258W mutant alpha-subunits. The UV absorbance and fluorescence properties of the F139W/F258W double mutant are identical with those of equimolar mixtures of the single mutants, suggesting that the Trp residue at each position can independently report the behavior of its respective folding unit. Each mutant alpha-subunit is wild-type enzymatically, and when UV absorbance is monitored, the urea-induced unfolding of the three tryptophan-containing alpha-subunits is virtually identical to the wild-type protein. These wild-type properties make these proteins attractive candidates for a fluorescence examination of the behavior of the individual folding units and the structure of potential intermediate(s) and as host proteins for the insertion of our existing destabilizing and/or stabilizing mutational alterations.",

        "abstract": "Tropomyosin, a coiled coil protein that binds along the length of actin filaments, contains 40 uninterrupted heptapeptide repeats characteristic of coiled coils. Yet, it is flexible. Regions of tropomyosin that may be important for binding to the filament and for interacting with troponin deviate from canonical coiled coil structure in subtle ways, altering the local conformation or energetics without interrupting the coiled coil. In a region rich in interface alanines (an Ala cluster), the chains pack closer than in canonical coiled coils, and are staggered, resulting in a bend [Brown et al. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 8496-8501]. Brown et al. suggested that bends at alanine clusters allow tropomyosin to wind on the actin filament helix. Another explanation is that local destabilization of the coiled coil, rather than close packing of the chains at Ala clusters per se, allows flexibility. Changing three Ala residues to canonical interface residues, A74L-A78V-A81L, greatly stabilized tropomyosin, measured using circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry, and reduced actin affinity >10-fold. Normal actin affinity and stability were restored in a mutant A74Q-A78N-A81Q that mimicked the stability of the Ala cluster but not the close packing of the chains. Analysis and modeling of comparable mutations introduced closer to the N-terminus show that the effects on stability and function depend on context. Models based on tropomyosin crystal structures give insight into possible effects of the mutations on the structure. We conclude that the significance of the Ala clusters in allowing flexibility of tropomyosin is stability-driven.",

McLendon, D., McLendon, G., and Sherman, F. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 496-499). Although both structures were similar, Water-166, buried within the wild type protein, is excluded from the Ile-52 mutant, which substantially reorganizes the local hydrogen bonding. Wild type Cys-102 was replaced with alanine or serine to eliminate dimerization in vitro. The Cys-102 (wild type), Ala-102, and Ser-102 proteins were equally stable, whereas the chemically modified Cys-102-SCH3 was less stable. The order of stability observed with replacements at positions 52 and 102 was as follows: Ile-52 Ala-102 greater than Ala-52 Ala-102 greater than Asn-52 Ala-102 (\"normal\") greater than Gly-52 Ala-102. No significant stabilization was attributed to potential energy interactions expressed as helix-forming propensities of replacements at position 52. A high correlation between differences in free energy changes and transfer free energies suggests hydrophobic interactions are the main factor for enhancing stability in the Ile-52 mutant. Additional possible contributions to the thermostability of the Ile-52 variant are energetic effects due to packing and hydrogen bonding changes surrounding position 52.",

We have previously shown that the GuHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding of 4-OT at pH 8.5 is well modeled as a two-state process involving only hexamer and unfolded monomer; and we have obtained spectroscopic evidence that intermediate state(s) is (are) populated in the equilibrium unfolding reaction at pHs 6.0 and 7.4 [Silinski, P., Allingham, M. J., and Fitzgerald, M. C. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 4493-4502]. Here, we report on the pH-induced equilibrium unfolding of 4-OT using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), far-UV-circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and catalytic activity measurements over the pH range from 1.5 to 10.1. Our results indicate that the native hexamer of 4-OT is the predominant species in solution at pHs > or =6.2, that a partially folded dimeric state of 4-OT is stabilized in solution at pH 4.8, and that the enzyme is largely denatured in strongly acidic solutions (pH < or =3.1). GuHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding studies on 4-OT at pH 4.8 indicate that the folded 4-OT dimer populated at this pH is stabilized by 11.7 kcal.mol(-1). The results of biophysical studies on a fluorescent analogue of the enzyme, 4-OT(F50Y), and the results of UV photo-cross-linking studies on a synthetically derived 4-OT analogue, 4-OT(P1Bpa), suggest the polypeptide chains in the 4-OT dimer are nativelike in structure with the exception of their C-termini.",

The purified mutant proteins adopted a similar conformation to wild type, but all were destabilized with respect to wild type. Analysis of the thermal melting transitions showed that the mutants S242F and Y214W further destabilized the C-terminal domain, whereas substitutions near the N terminus either destabilized a different domain or affected interactions between domains. Two mutant proteins carried an additional cysteine residue, which formed disulfide cross-links but did not affect the denaturation transition. These mutants differed both from temperature-sensitive folding mutants found in other P22 structural proteins and from the thermolabile temperature-sensitive mutants described for T4 lysozyme. The results suggest that the defects in these mutants are due to destabilization of domains affecting the weak subunit-subunit interactions important in the assembly and function of the virus precursor shell.",

        "abstract": "Cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule that participates in ordered calcium-dependent self-association interactions both between molecules on the same cell surface (cis-interactions) and on neighboring cell surfaces (trans-interactions). Cadherin is a transmembrane protein that has 3-7 independently folded beta-barrel extracellular domains. Both types of self-association interactions are mediated through the most N-terminal domain (Domain 1). Although the structural nature of the trans-interactions is clear, the nature of the cis-interactions is ambiguous despite several high-resolution structural studies. From earlier studies, it is understood that for the trans-interactions to happen, cis-interactions are mandatory. Hence, our first steps are to study the energetic driving forces for the cis-interactions. We have simplified the approach by first examining participating extracellular domains individually. We report here our initial experiments into the stability of Domain 2 of E-cadherin (ECAD2). ECAD2 appears monomeric, according to results from mass spectrometry and sedimentation equilibrium studies. We report denaturation data from differential scanning calorimetric experiments, and temperature and denaturant-induced unfolding experiments monitored by circular dichroism. These studies give a unified picture of the energetics of ECAD2-folding and stability, for which DeltaG degrees is 6.6 kcal/mol, T(m) is 54 degrees C, DeltaH(m) is 90 kcal/mol, and DeltaC(p) is 1300 cal/Kmol. These parameters are independent of calcium up to 5 mM, indicating that ECAD2 does not bind calcium at physiological calcium levels.",

It was found that the intact protein melts in two distinct temperature regions reflecting unfolding of different parts of the molecule with different stability. The less stable structures unfold in a low temperature transition with a tm of 69 degrees C or lower depending on conditions. Unfolding of the more stable structures was observed at extremely high temperatures, tm > 110 degrees C at acidic pH < 3.5 and tm = 90 degrees C at pH 8.6 with 2 M GdmCL. Thermodynamic analysis of the low and high temperature DSC-obtained heat absorption peaks indicated unambiguously that the first represents melting of three thermolabile independently folded domains while two thermostable domains melt in the second one giving a total of five domains in each a subunit of rFXIII. Both 24 kDa and 12 kDa fragments exhibited a sigmoidal spectral transition at comparatively high temperature where the thermolabile structures are already denatured, indicating that two thermostable domains are formed by the C-terminal portion of rFXIII and correspond to the two beta-barrels revealed by crystallography. The remaining 56 kDa portion forms three thermolabile domains, one of which corresponds to the N-terminal beta-sandwich and the other two to the catalytic core. Fast accessible surface calculations of the X-ray model of rFXIII confirmed the presence of two structural subdomains in the core region with the boundary at residue 332. The thermolabile domains appear to interact with each other intra- and/or intermolecularly resulting in dimerization the a subunits. At acidic pH, where all domains became destabilized but still remained folded, interdomainial interactions seemed to be abolished, resulting in the reversible dissociation of the dimer as revealed by ultracentrifugation analysis.",

Spectrophotometrically monitored thermal unfolding of trypsinogen and beta-trypsin in the acidic pH range yielded substantial differences in the stability parameters. Compared to beta-trypsin, trypsinogen exhibits lower enthalpy of denaturation delta Hden, higher denaturational heat capacity change delta Cp,den, but very similar temperature of denaturation Tden. pH-dependence of the conformational stability of the ligand-free trypsinogen, measured also by GdnCl-induced unfolding, is bell shaped with the maximum free energy of unfolding delta Gden = 10.9 kcal/mole at pH 5.5 (4.5 pH units below its isoelectric point). At pH 8.3 the conformational stability of the zymogen drops to delta Gden = 3.2 kcal/mole, but increases by delta delta Gden = 6.1 kcal/mole in the presence of Ca2+. This significant stabilization of the zymogen by the calcium ion is also pH-dependent. To assess the effect of Ca2+ on the trypsinogen molecule, the spectrophotometric titrations and NOESY spectra were carried out. Based on the structural analysis, the long range effects between Ca2+-->Ile73-->Trp141 and the interdomain His40-Asp194 ion pair are proposed to be partially responsible for trypsinogen stabilization. Additionally, the steady-state parameters for hydrolysis of the oligopeptide amide substrate catalysed by free trypsinogen, its complexes with Ca2+ and the IleVal dipeptide and by beta-trypsin were measured. It appears that in the pH range 5.5 to 8.3 the stability and the catalytic activity/ligand binding properties are fully separated. Whereas the deprotonation of His57 accounts for the increase of kcat/km parameter, deprotonation of His40 is involved in the huge decrease of the conformational stability. Similarly, a large stabilization by the calcium ion is not accompanied by changes in enzymatic activity. Presented data are encouraging for an enzyme design directed toward improved stability.",

Among the sugars tested, reducing sugars gave the lower apparent Deltan as compared with nonreducing sugars probably because of the direct interaction of reducing terminal with amino group of proteins at a high temperature. From the knowledge of Deltan, a new thermodynamic model for protein stability was proposed with explicit consideration for hydration state change of protein upon unfolding. From this model, the contribution of a(W) was proven to be always positive for stabilization of proteins and its effect is not negligible depending on Deltan and a(W).",

F173A retains high levels of secondary structure, as determined by far-UV circular dichroism (CD), but has substantially reduced levels of tertiary structure, as determined by near-UV CD and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. F173A also binds the hydrophobic dye 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) over a range of pH values and exhibits noncooperative equilibrium unfolding (as judged by the noncoincidence of monophasic unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD and lambda(max), with midpoints of unfolding at 2.6 +/- 0. 1 and 3.5 +/- 0.3 M urea, respectively, and the lack of an observable thermal unfolding transition). These are all properties of molten globule states, suggesting that the loss of activity of F173A results from the disruption of the fine structure of the protein, rather than from the loss of a side chain that is important for ligand-receptor interactions. Surprisingly, under some conditions, this loosened conformation is no more susceptible to proteolytic attack than the parent protein.

We have studied the effect of pH on the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme phosphoserine aminotransferase produced by the facultative alkaliphile Bacillus circulans ssp. alkalophilus using thermodynamic and crystallographic analysis. Enzymatic activity assay showed that the enzyme has maximum activity at pH 9.0 and relative activity less than 10% at pH 7.0. Differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism experiments revealed variations in the stability and denaturation profiles of the enzyme at different pHs. Most importantly, release of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and protein thermal denaturation were found to occur simultaneously at pH 6.0 in contrast to pH 8.5 where denaturation preceded cofactor's release by approximately 3 degrees C. To correlate the observed differences in thermal denaturation with structural features, the crystal structure of phosphoserine aminotransferase was determined at 1.2 and 1.5 A resolution at two different pHs (8.5 and 4.6, respectively). Analysis of the two structures revealed changes in the vicinity of the active site and in surface residues. A conformational change in a loop involved in substrate binding at the entrance of the active site has been identified upon pH change. Moreover, the number of intramolecular ion pairs was found reduced in the pH 4.6 structure. Taken together, the presented kinetics, thermal denaturation, and crystallographic data demonstrate a potential role of the active site in unfolding and suggest that subtle but structurally significant conformational rearrangements are involved in the stability and integrity of phosphoserine aminotransferase in response to pH changes.",

        "abstract": "We have recently developed a new method for designing thermostable proteins using phylogenetic trees of enzymes. In this study, we investigated a method for designing proteins with improved stability using 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) from Thermus thermophilus as a model enzyme. We designed 12 mutant enzymes, each having an ancestral amino acid residue that was present in the common ancestor of Bacteria and Archaea. At least six of the 12 ancestral mutants tested showed thermal stability higher than that of the original enzyme. The results supported the hyperthermophilic universal ancestor hypothesis. The effect of ancestral residues on IPMDHs of several organisms and on the related enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase was summarised and analysed. The effect of an ancestral residue on thermostability did not depend on the degree of conservation of the residue at the site, suggesting that the stabilisation of these mutant proteins is not related to sequence conservation but to the antiquity of the introduced residues. The results suggest also that this method could be an efficient way of designing mutant enzymes with higher thermostability based only on the primary structure and a phylogenetic tree.",

The non-coincidence of all three transition curves demonstrated the existence of a highly populated partially-folded form near 39 degrees C at pH 7.8. This intermediate retains substantial secondary structure and partially excludes one or more of the five tryptophans from solvent; however, the intermediate has lost specific tertiary packing around its aromatic residues. Increases in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity are observed for both the native/intermediate and intermediate/unfolded transitions; the majority of the changes in these parameters occurs in the first transition. These results suggest that the thermal unfolding reaction of des-Cys dihydrofolate reductase involves a stable intermediate whose properties resemble those of a molten globule.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium and kinetic analyses have been carried out to elucidate the folding mechanism of homodimeric ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) from Comamonas testosteroni. The folding of KSI was reversible since the activity as well as the fluorescence and CD spectra was almost completely recovered after refolding. The equilibrium unfolding transitions monitored by fluorescence and CD measurements were almost coincident with each other, and the transition midpoint increased with increasing protein concentration. This suggests that the KSI folding follows a simple two-state mechanism consisting of native dimer and unfolded monomer without any thermodynamically stable intermediates. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis and size-exclusion chromatography of KSI at different urea concentrations supported the two-state model without any evidence of folded monomeric intermediates. Consistent with the two-state model, (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra obtained for KSI in the unfolding transition region could be reproduced by a simple addition of the spectra of the native and the unfolded KSI. The KSI refolding kinetics as monitored by fluorescence intensity could be described as a fast first-order process followed by a second-order and a subsequent slow first-order processes with rate constants of 60 s(-)(1), 5.4 x 10(4) M(-)(1).s(-)(1), and 0.017 s(-)(1), respectively, at 0.62 M urea, suggesting that there may be a monomeric folding intermediate. After a burst phase that accounts for >83% of the total amplitude, the negative molar ellipticity at 225 nm increased slowly in a single phase at a rate comparable to that of the bimolecular intermediate step. The kinetics of activity recovery from the denatured state were markedly dependent upon the protein concentration, implying that the monomers are not fully active. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the dimerization induces KSI to fold into the complete structure and is crucial for maintaining the tertiary structure to perform efficient catalysis.",

        "abstract": "It has been shown that protein stability can be modulated from site-directed mutations that affect the entropy of protein unfolding [Matthews, B. W., Nicholson, H., & Becktel, W. J. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 6663-6667]. However, the effect of a specific amino acid replacement on stability highly depends on the location of the mutation site and its environment in the protein structure [Yutani, K., Hayashi, S., Sugisaki, Y., & Ogasahara, K. (1991) Proteins Struct., Funct., Genet. 9, 90-98). To clarify the role of specific proline residues in the thermostability of human lysozyme (h-lysozyme), a series of proline mutants were investigated by means of scanning calorimetry and high-resolution X-ray crystallography. The thermodynamic properties of the mutant and wild-type h-lysozymes are compared and discussed on the basis of their three-dimensional structure. h-Lysozyme contains two proline residues at positions 71 and 103. The Pro71----Gly substitution was found to destabilize h-lysozyme by decreasing the entropic contribution of unfolding by about 2 kcal/mol at 68.8 degrees C. This is consistent with the theoretical expectations for such a substitution. However, the same substitution at position 103 (Pro103----Gly) does not affect h-lysozyme stability, and the thermodynamic properties of the P71G/P103G and P71G mutants are essentially the same. Pro71 which is conserved among lysozymes from other species, appears to be important for stability, whereas Pro103, which is not conserved, does not. These differences are explained in terms of residue accessibility to the solvent and crystallographic B-factor, which reflects the amino acid mobility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The temperature-induced unfolding of single, double, and triple mutants of barstar, the specific intracellular protein inhibitor of barnase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, has been studied by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. The thermal unfolding of barstar mutants, where at least one of the two cysteine residues in the molecule had been replaced by alanine, follows a two-state mechanism at neutral and alkaline pH. The unfolding enthalpy and heat capacity changes are slightly lower than those accepted for highly compact, small, globular proteins. We have found that at pH 2.5, where barstar seems to be in a molten globule state, the protein has a heat capacity between that of the native and the unfolded states and shows some tendency for association. Scanning calorimetry experiments were also extended to the barstar--barnase complex in the neutral and alkaline pH range. The binding constants obtained from DSC studies are similar to those already obtained from other (kinetic) studies. The interaction of barstar and barnase was also investigated by isothermal calorimetry in various buffers within the pH range 6.0-10.0 and a temperature range of 15-35 degrees C. The favorable enthalpy contribution to the binding is about 4 times higher than the entropic one at 25 degrees C. The overall data analysis of the combined calorimetric results has led to the thermodynamic characterization of barstar unfolding and the interaction of barstar and barnase over a wide range of temperatures.",

Results from DSC experiments are in good agreement with spectroscopic studies [Swint, L., & Robertson, A.D. (1993) Protein Sci. 2, 2037-2049] and fit well to the two-state unfolding model. The average ratio of calorimetric to van't Hoff enthalpies is 0.99 +/- 0.03 (n = 16), and the average value of delta Cp is 620 +/- 20 cal/(mol K) (n = 7). The free energy of unfolding (delta G(u)o) increases in the presence of salt at both pH 1.5 and 4.5. This stabilization is not due to ion binding and probably results from screened repulsive interactions between the cationic groups of OMTKY3. At very low ionic strength, the change in delta G(u)o from pH 1.5 to 4.5, delta delta GpHo, is 3.5 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol. Few interactions between ionizing groups are affected by the addition of 200 mM KCl; delta delta GpHo decreases by only 0.4 +/- 0.3 kcal/mol. Comparison of delta delta GpHo with values calculated from the pKas of all six carboxyl groups in OMTKY3 [Schaller, W.S., & Robertson, A.D. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 4714-4723] suggests that some pKas in the denatured state may be lower than those of model compounds.

We describe here the solution structure and properties of Sso10b2 from Sulfolobus solfataricus. NMR data including residual dipolar couplings and (15)N relaxation data demonstrated that the protein adopts a beta(1)alpha(1)beta(2)alpha(2)beta(3)beta(4) topology with an IF-3-like fold. The protein dimerizes in solution at 30 degrees C via a hydrophobic surface defined by the C-terminal alpha(2)beta(3)beta(4) elements with a structure similar to one of the putative dimers indicated by previous crystal structures. DSC and circular dichroism data demonstrated an unusual two-state structural transition near the growth temperature which led to an increase in beta-sheet content without dissociation of the dimer. The cooperativity of the transition exceeded that of a dimer at pH 7, demonstrating the presence of higher order oligomers near the growth temperature at pH 7. Reverse titrations of Sso10b2 with nucleic acid showed that the protein binds single-stranded DNA (K(d) of 3 x 10(-)(7) M) with higher affinity than RNA (1.3 x 10(-)(6) M) or double-stranded DNA (1.5 x 10(-)(5) M) in 10 mM KH(2)PO(4) (pH 7.0, 20 degrees C).

The Ca2+ dependence of the denaturation equilibria proves that, in the transition region, partially unfolded alpha-lactalbumin consists of a mixture of Ca(2+)-loaded and Ca(2+)-free protein. The thermodynamic parameters of the unfolding of these two species were determined at 68 degrees C and were then compared with one other, with the thermodynamic parameters deduced from calorimetric titration of alpha-lactalbumin with Ca2+, and with those derived from Ca2+ titration of a mutant human lysozyme having an engineered Ca(2+)-binding site. This comparison indicated that (a) the unfolding curves for Ca(2+)-BLA deduced from the near-UV ellipticity change are more able to distinguish between unfolding with and without Ca2+ release than those deduced from differential scanning calorimetry, (b) the Ca(2+)-loaded denaturated state of BLA is more folded than the Ca(2+)-free protein at 68 degrees C, and (c) a heat-induced unfolding process, consisting of an initial Ca2+ release, followed by a conformational relaxation, is unlikely to occur at the experimental pH and in the millimolar region of Ca2+ concentrations, due to the large free energy requirement of the initial step. A more probable mechanism would be unfolding via a Ca(2+)-loaded intermediately unfolded state, with subsequent Ca2+ release.",

The absence of this fluorescence-detected phase in the refolding of the Trp-74Phe mutant protein strongly implies that this early phase in refolding can be assigned to just one of the five Trp residues in the protein, Trp-74. In addition, water-soluble fluorescence quenching agents, iodide and cesium, have a much less significant effect on this early step in refolding than on the slower phases that lead to native and native-like conformers.

The diminishing GAPDH stability in the presence of alpha-crystallin has been explained assuming that heating of GAPDH induces dissociation of the tetrameric form of the enzyme into dimers interacting with alpha-crystallin. The dissociation of the enzyme tetramer was shown by sedimentation velocity at 45 degrees C. Suppression of thermal aggregation of GAPDH by alpha-crystallin was studied by dynamic light scattering under the conditions wherein temperature was elevated at a constant rate. The construction of the light scattering intensity versus the hydrodynamic radius (R(h)) plots enabled estimating the hydrodynamic radius of the start aggregates (R(h,0)).

To investigate the role of the His12 and Lys13 pair in the enzyme's thermoadaptation, we reintroduced the \"mesophilic residues\" Asn and Gly into both thermophilic TIMs. Neither double mutant displayed diminished structural stability, but the bTIM double mutant showed drastically reduced catalytic activity. No similar behavior was observed with the tTIM double mutant, suggesting that the presence of the His12 and Lys13 cannot be systematically correlated to thermoadaptation in TIMs. We determined the crystal structure of the bTIM double mutant complexed with 2-phosphoglycolate to 2.4-A resolution. A molecular dynamics simulation showed that upon substitution of Lys13 to Gly an increase of the flexibility of loop 1 is observed, causing an incorrect orientation of the catalytic Lys10. This suggests that Lys13 in bTIM plays a crucial role in the functional adaptation of this enzyme to high temperature. Analysis of bTIM single mutants supports this assumption.",

        "abstract": "Selective deamidation of proteins and peptides is a reaction of great interest, both because it has a physiological role and because it can cause alteration in the biological activity, local folding, and overall stability of the protein. In order to evaluate the thermodynamic effects of this reaction in proteins, we investigated the temperature-induced denaturation of ribonuclease A derivatives in which asparagine 67 was selectively replaced by an aspartyl residue or an isoaspartyl residue, as a consequence of an in vitro deamidation reaction. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were performed in the pH range 3.0-6.0, where the unfolding process is reversible, according to the reheating criterion used. It resulted that the monodeamidated forms have a different thermal stability with respect to the parent enzyme. In particular, the replacement of asparagine 67 with an isoaspartyl residue leads to a decrease of 6.3 degrees C of denaturation temperature and 65 kJ mol-1 of denaturation enthalpy at pH 5.0. These results are discussed and correlated to the X-ray three-dimensional structure of this derivative. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the difference in thermal stability between RNase A and (N67isoD)RNase A is due to enthalpic effects arising from the loss of two important hydrogen bonds in the loop containing residue 67, partially counterbalanced by entropic effects. Finally, the influence of cytidine-2'-monophosphate on the stability of the three ribonucleases at pH 5.0 is studied and explained in terms of its binding on the active site of ribonucleases. The analysis makes it possible to estimate the apparent binding constant and binding enthalpy for the three proteins.",

Analysis of the transitions reveals that no partially folded intermediates can be detected under equilibrium conditions. The stability of the enzyme is very low with a delta G0 value of -9 +/- 2 kJ/mol at 20 degrees C. The kinetics of unfolding and refolding of aldolase are complex and comprise at least one fast and two slow reactions. This complexity arises from prolyl isomerization reactions in the unfolded chain, which are kinetically coupled to the actual folding reaction. Comparison with model calculations shows that at least two prolyl peptide bonds give rise to the observed slow folding reactions of aldolase and that all of the involved bonds are presumably in the trans conformation in the native state. The rate constant of the actual folding reaction is fast with a relaxation time of about 15 s at the midpoint of the folding transition at 15 degrees C. The data presented on the folding and stability of aldolase are comparable to the properties of much smaller proteins. This might be connected with the simple and highly repetitive tertiary structure pattern of the enzyme, which belongs to the group of alpha/beta barrel proteins.",

Comparison of the unfolding entropy of BPTI at 110 degrees C with corresponding values of other proteins, revealed that the delta S values of BPTI are lower by 2.9 J/(K X residue).

        "abstract": "NMR studies of protein denatured states provide insights into potential initiation sites for folding that may be too transient to be observed kinetically. We have characterized the structure and dynamics of the acid-denatured state of protein G by using a F30H mutant of G(B1) which is on the margin of stability. At 5 degrees C, F30H-G(B1) is greater than 95% folded at pH 7.0 and is greater than 95% unfolded at pH 4.0. This range of stability is useful because the denatured state can be examined under relatively mild conditions which are optimal for folding G(B1). We have assigned almost all backbone (15)N, H(N), and H(alpha) resonances in the acid-denatured state. Chemical shift, coupling constant, and NOE data indicate that the denatured state has considerably more residual structure when studied under these mild conditions than in the presence of chemical denaturants. The acid-denatured state populates nativelike conformations with both alpha-helical and beta-hairpin characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a denatured state with NOE and coupling constant evidence for beta-hairpin character. A number of non-native turn structures are also detected, particularly in the region corresponding to the beta1-beta2 hairpin of the folded state. Steady-state \u00bf(1)H-(15)N\u00bf NOE results demonstrate restricted backbone flexibility in more structured regions of the denatured protein. Overall, our studies suggest that regions of the helix, the beta3-beta4 hairpin, and the beta1-beta2 turn may serve as potential initiation sites for folding of G(B). Furthermore, residual structure in acid-denatured F30H-G(B1) is more extensive than in peptide fragments corresponding to the beta1-beta2, alpha-helix, and beta3-beta4 regions, suggesting additional medium-to-long-range interactions in the full-length polypeptide chain.",

        "abstract": "The methionine 80 sulfur-heme iron bond of rat cytochrome c, whose stability is decreased by mutating the phylogenetically invariant residue proline 30 to alanine and increased when tyrosine 67 is changed to phenylalanine, recovers its wild-type characteristics when both substitutions are performed on the same molecule. Titrations with urea, analyzed according to the heteropolymer theory [Alonso, D. O. V., & Dill, K. A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 5974-5985], indicate that both single mutations increase the solvent exposure of hydrophobic groups in the unfolded state, while in the double mutant this conformational perturbation disappears. Similar increases in solvent exposure of hydrophobic groups are observed when the sulfur-iron bond of the wild-type protein is broken by alkylation of the methionine sulfur, by high pH, or by binding the heme iron with cyanide. The compensatory effects of the two single mutations do not extend to the overall stability of the protein. The added loss of conformational stability due to the single mutations amounts to 7.3 kcal/mol out of the 9 kcal/mol representing the overall free energy of stabilization of the native conformation of the wild-type protein. The folded conformation of the doubly mutated protein is only 2 kcal/mol less stable than that of the wild type. These results indicate that the double mutant protein is able to retain the essential folding pattern of cytochrome c and the thermodynamic stability of the methionine sulfur-heme iron bond, in spite of structural differences that weaken the overall stability of the molecule.",

        "abstract": "Shigella flexneri causes dysentery after invading the epithelial cells of the human colon. Enterocyte invasion is induced by the bacterial effector IpaC (invasion plasmid antigen C), which triggers Shigella entry into epithelial cells by a rather poorly understood mechanism. IpaC is also involved in pathogen escape into the host cell cytoplasm following uptake, and this property may be reflected in its ability to disrupt phospholipid vesicles in vitro. Purified recombinant IpaC interacts with liposome vesicles to cause the release of small molecules trapped inside. This interaction requires that the liposomes possess an acidic phospholipid component. To better understand the events involved in the disruption of liposomes by IpaC, single tryptophan mutants were generated to permit the use of intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism, and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopies to examine the effect that phospholipid membrane association has on IpaC structure and stability. These mutants were also used to determine how amino acid substitutions within specific regions of IpaC influence its activity in vivo. The outcomes of this study include findings that cholesterol greatly impacts IpaC association with phospholipid membranes, tryptophan incorporation into specific regions of IpaC (especially near the C-terminus) can greatly impact its in vivo activity, and interaction with phospholipid membranes causes differing degrees of change in the fluorescence of tryptophan residues introduced at specific sites within IpaC. These data, together with fluorescence quenching analyses, provide new functional and structural information concerning IpaC and its insertion into phospholipid membranes.",

        "abstract": "The effect of methanol on the folding of staphylococcal nuclease has been investigated. Equilibrium thermal unfolding transitions were monitored by fluorescence emission. The transition was very sensitive to the presence of methanol (at pH 7.0), the Tm decreased from above 50 degrees C for aqueous solution to below 0 degree C for 70% methanol. The transitions were fully reversible and conformed to two-state behavior. A linear relationship was observed between the hydrophobicity of the solvent and both the Tm and the change in delta G for unfolding. The effect of pH on the transition in 50% methanol at 0 degree C was essentially the same as for aqueous solution, with a cooperative transition in the vicinity of apparent pH (pH*) 4. The unfolding transition was determined as a function of guanidine thiocyanate in aqueous and 50% methanol solvents. The midpoints of the transitions were 0.30 and 0.20 M, respectively, at 2.1 degrees C. The kinetics of folding at 0 degree C were compared in aqueous, 50% methanol and 0.30 M guanidine thiocyanate solvents, by monitoring changes in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity. Triphasic kinetics for refolding in both aqueous and 50% methanol solutions were observed in stopped-flow experiments. In both solvent systems the slowest phase is ascribed to proline isomerization. The kinetics of refolding were monitored at subzero temperatures in 50% methanol at pH* 7.0 in manual mixing experiments. Biphasic kinetics were observed at temperatures between 0 and -35 degrees C. A third, faster phase, was inferred from the missing amplitude. The energies of activation were 20.0 and 17.2 kcal mol-1, respectively, for the two slower phases. At -33.8 degrees C, the observed pseudo first-order rate constants were 1.2 x 10(-3) and 2.1 x 10(-5) s-1. At temperatures above -35 degrees C, the sum of the observed amplitudes was essentially constant at 70-75% of the expected total amplitude. At lower temperatures the amplitude of the refolding reaction decreased, and the native state was not formed (unless the temperature was increased), due to the formation of a trapped intermediate state. This intermediate has circular dichroism and fluorescence properties consistent with a compact state with some molten globule characteristics.",

        "abstract": "ThermoFluor (a miniaturized high-throughput protein stability assay) was used to analyze the linkage between protein thermal stability and ligand binding. Equilibrium binding ligands increase protein thermal stability by an amount proportional to the concentration and affinity of the ligand. Binding constants (K(b)) were measured by examining the systematic effect of ligand concentration on protein stability. The precise ligand effects depend on the thermodynamics of protein stability: in particular, the unfolding enthalpy. An extension of current theoretical treatments was developed for tight binding inhibitors, where ligand effect on T(m) can also reveal binding stoichiometry. A thermodynamic analysis of carbonic anhydrase by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) enabled a dissection of the Gibbs free energy of stability into enthalpic and entropic components. Under certain conditions, thermal stability increased by over 30 degrees C; the heat capacity of protein unfolding was estimated from the dependence of calorimetric enthalpy on T(m). The binding affinity of six sulfonamide inhibitors to two isozymes (human type 1 and bovine type 2) was analyzed by both ThermoFluor and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), resulting in a good correlation in the rank ordering of ligand affinity. This combined investigation by ThermoFluor, ITC, and DSC provides a detailed picture of the linkage between ligand binding and protein stability. The systematic effect of ligands on stability is shown to be a general tool to measure affinity.",

The stability of the native, intact protein was compared to that of protein with retinal removed, and/or cleaved in one or two of the loops connecting the transmembrane helices. The stability was assessed using differential scanning calorimetry and thermal denaturation curves obtained from ultraviolet circular dichroism and absorption spectroscopy. Retinal binding and the loop connections were each found to make a small contribution to stability, and even a sample that was cleaved twice as well as bleached to remove retinal denatured well above room temperature. Removal of retinal destabilized the protein more than cleaving once, and about as much as cleaving twice. Retinal binding and the connections in the loops were found to stabilize BR in independent ways. Cleavage of the molecule into fragments did not reduce the intermolecular cooperativity of the denaturation. Dilution of the protein by addition of excess lipid in order to eliminate the purple membrane crystal lattice also did not alter the cooperativity. These results are used to compare the relative importance of various contributors to the stability of BR.",

The biological properties and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the molecule indicate that the conformation is similar to that of native human insulin. Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced equilibrium denaturation of the analog as monitored by CD intensity at 224 nm indicates a single cooperative transition with a midpoint of 4.9 M GdnHCl. In contrast, when the equilibrium denaturation is observed by steady-state fluorescence emission intensity at 350 nm, two distinct transitions are observed. The first transition accounts for 60% of the observed signal and has a midpoint of 1.5 M GdnHCl. The second transition roughly parallels that observed by CD measurements with an approximate midpoint of 4.5 M GdnHCl. The near-UV CD spectrum, size-exclusion, and ultracentrifugation properties of [WB28,PB29]insulin indicate that this analog does not self-associate in a concentration-dependent manner as does human insulin. Thus, the observed fluorescence changes must be due to specific conformational transitions which occur upon unfolding of the insulin monomer with the product of the first transition representing a stable folding intermediate of this molecule.",

The replacement of Leu 28 by Arg and of Glu 139 by Gln resulted in additive effects on both kinetic and equilibrium properties of the reversible unfolding transition; no evidence for interaction was obtained. In contrast, the Arg 28/Lys 139 double replacement changed the equilibrium folding model from two state to multistate and showed evidence for interaction in one of the two kinetic phases detected in both unfolding and refolding reactions.

        "abstract": "The cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding proline residues in proteins can limit the rate at which a protein folds to its native conformation. Mutagenic analyses of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherichia coli show that this isomerization reaction can be intramolecularly catalyzed by a side chain from an amino acid which is distant in sequence but adjacent in the native conformation. The guanidinium NH2 nitrogen of Arg 44 forms one hydrogen bond to the imide nitrogen and a second to the carbonyl oxygen of Pro 66 in wild-type DHFR. Replacement of Arg 44 with Leu results in a change of the nature of the two slow steps in refolding from being limited by the acquisition of secondary and/or tertiary structure to being limited by isomerization. The simultaneous replacement of Pro 66 with Ala (i.e., the Leu 44/Ala 66 double mutant) eliminates this isomerization reaction and once again makes protein folding the limiting process. Apparently, one or both of the hydrogen bonds between Arg 44 and Pro 66 accelerate the isomerization of the Gln 65-Pro 66 peptide bond. The replacement of Arg 44 with Leu affects the kinetics of the slow folding reactions in a fashion which indicates that the crucial hydrogen bonds form in the transition states for the rate-limiting steps in folding.",

We compared the thermodynamic characteristics, and studied effects of pH on the stability, of individual domains in rod, light meromyosin (LMM), and subfragment 2 (S-2). In rod, the lowest stability domain (approximately 400 amino acid residues per double strand), with a Tm of 42.4 degrees C, a delta Hcal of 190 kcal/mol, and a delta G of 3.39 kcal/mol, at pH 7.02, destabilized by absorption of protons, is located at the LMM/S-2 junction and split into two parts, one associated with S-2 (approximately 100 residues per double strand) and the other with LMM (300 residues per double strand). The fragment with S-2 is likely a part of the \"hinge\" suggested by Swenson and Ritchie [(1980) Biochemistry 19, 5371-5375]. All other domains of rod released protons on melting. The domains located in S-2 were the most sensitive to pH and released a total of 0.9 proton on melting. The thermal meltings of all domains in myosin rod, LMM, and S-2 were independent of each other, and enthalpies of melting were additive in the whole pH range studied. Their sensitivities to pH and KCl were also unaffected by the presence or absence of other fragments. For example, domains in an isolated S-2 behaved similarly as they were in the rod, and so were domains in LMM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We have employed DSC to study thermal stability of myosin and actin in their filamentous forms (i.e., thick and thin filaments). The thermal stability of the myosin monomer, as well as polymers, showed remarkable sensitivities to pH and to the ionic strength of the solution. At pH 7.5, the endotherm of myosin filaments was broad and resembled that of the monomer in solution. Reducing the pH to 6.3 split the endotherm of the filament into two major transitions. The first one, with a Tm of 47 degrees C, a delta Hcal of 805 kcal/mol, and a cooperative ratio (CR) of 0.1, was relatively insensitive to the pH changes whereas the second one which represented approximately 80% of the helical structure was pH sensitive. The second transition released 2.17 H+ per mole at 0.17 M KCl and was defined by a Tm of 53.9 degrees C, a delta Hcal of 917 kcal/mol, and a CR of 0.35. The major fragment contributing to the splitting of the endotherm was interpreted to be S-2 because the Tm of purified S-2 in a similar medium also shifted from 39.5 degrees C at pH 7.3 to 49.6 degrees C at pH 6.0. KCl had similar effects on the shape of the endotherm of the thick filament.

Exchange measurements at two different pH values (5.4 and 6.0) show that the exchange process occurs according to the conditions of the EX2 limit. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements have been carried out in 2H2O under conditions analogous to those used in the NMR experiments in order to determine the values of DeltaCp, DeltaHu and Tm, corresponding to the thermal denaturation of both proteins. For the amide protons of a large number of residues in RNase A, the free energies at 25 degreesC for exchange competent unfolding processes are much lower than the calorimetric denaturation free energies, thus showing that exchange occurs through local fluctuations in the native state. For 20 other protons, the cleavage reaction had approximately the same effect on the exchange rate constants than on the equilibrium constant for unfolding, indicating that those protons exchange by global unfolding. There is a good agreement between the residues to which these protons belong and those involved in the putative folding nucleation site identified by quench-flow NMR studies. The unfolding free energies of the slowest exchanging protons, DeltaGex, as evaluated from exchange data, are much larger than the calorimetric free energies of unfolding, DeltaGu. Given the agreement between DeltaDeltaGex(A-S), the difference in free energy from exchange for a given proton of the two proteins, and DeltaDeltaGu(A-S), the difference in the calorimetric free energy of the two proteins, the discrepancy indicates that the intrinsic exchange rates in the unfolded state of those protons cannot be approximated by those measured in short unstructured peptides and, consequently, exchange for those protons in RNase A and S must occur through a rather structured denatured state.",

The molten globule lacks a tertiary circular dichroism signal but has secondary structure similar to that of the native state. The molten globule binds 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS). The unfolding thermodynamics of MBP at both pHs were measured by carrying out a series of isothermal urea melts at temperatures ranging from 274-329 K. At 298 K, values of deltaGdegrees , deltaCp, and Cm were 3.1+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1), 5.9+/-0.8 kcal mol(-1) K(-1) (15.9 cal (mol-residue)(-1) K(-1)), and 0.8 M, respectively, at pH 3.0 and 14.5+/-0.4 kcal mol(-1), 8.3+/-0.7 kcal mol(-1) K(-1) (22.4 kcal (mol-residue)(-1) K(-1)), and 3.3 M, respectively, at pH 7.1. Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation at pH 7.1 gave values of deltaGdegrees and deltaCp similar to those obtained with urea. The m values for denaturation are strongly temperature dependent, in contrast to what has been previously observed for small globular proteins. The value of deltaCp per mol-residue for the molten globule is comparable to corresponding values of deltaCp for the unfolding of typical globular proteins and suggests that it is a highly ordered structure, unlike molten globules of many small proteins. The value of deltaCp per mol-residue for the unfolding of the native state is among the highest currently known for any protein.",

We have compared the stability and unfolding kinetics of a highly fluorescent mutant of Green Fluorescent Protein, GFPmut2, in solution and in wet, nanoporous silica gels. In the absence of denaturant, encapsulation does not induce any observable change in the circular dichroism and fluorescence emission spectra of GFPmut2. In solution, the unfolding induced by guanidinium chloride is well described by a thermodynamic and kinetic two-state process. In the gel, biphasic unfolding kinetics reveal that at least two alternative conformations of the native protein are significantly populated. The relative rates for the unfolding of each conformer differ by almost two orders of magnitude. The slower rate, once extrapolated to native solvent conditions, superimposes to that of the single unfolding phase observed in solution. Differences in the dependence on denaturant concentration are consistent with restrictions opposed by the gel to possibly expanded transition states and to the conformational entropy of the denatured ensemble. The observed behavior highlights the significance of investigating protein function and stability in different environments to uncover structural and dynamic properties that can escape detection in dilute solution, but might be relevant for proteins in vivo.",

        "abstract": "It is known that, while melittin at micromolar concentrations is unfolded under conditions of low ionic strength at neutral pH, it adopts a tetrameric alpha-helical structure under conditions of high ionic strength, at alkaline pH, or at high peptide concentrations. To understand the mechanism of the conformational transition of melittin, we examined in detail the conformation of melittin under various conditions by far-UV circular dichroism at 20 degrees C. We found that the helical conformation is also stabilized by strong acids such as perchloric acid. The effects of various acids varied largely and were similar to those of the corresponding salts, indicating that the anions are responsible for the salt- or acid-induced transitions. The order of effectiveness of various monovalent anions was consistent with the electroselectivity series of anions toward anion-exchange resins, indicating that the anion binding is responsible for the salt- or acid-induced transitions. From the NaCl-, HCl-, and alkaline pH-induced conformational transitions, we constructed a phase diagram of the anion- and pH-dependent conformational transition. The phase diagram was similar in shape to that of acid-denatured apomyoglobin [Goto, Y., & Fink, A.L. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 214, 803-805] or that of the amphiphilic Lys, Leu model polypeptide [Goto, Y., & Aimoto, S. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 218, 387-396], suggesting a common mechanism of the conformational transition. The anion-, pH-, and peptide concentration-dependent conformational transition of melittin was explained on the basis of an equation in which the conformational transition is linked to proton and anion binding to the titratable groups.",

        "title": "Alpha-helix stability in proteins. I. Empirical correlations concerning substitution of side-chains at the N and C-caps and the replacement of alanine by glycine or serine at solvent-exposed surfaces.", 
        "abstract": "The importance of amino acid side-chains in helix stability has been investigated by making a series of mutations at the N-caps, C-caps and internal positions of the solvent-exposed faces of the two alpha-helices of barnase. There is a strong positional and context dependence of the effect of a particular amino acid on stability. Correlations have been found that provide insight into the physical basis of helix stabilization. The relative effects of Ala and Gly (or Ser) may be rationalized on the basis of solvent-accessible surface areas: burial of hydrophobic surface stabilizes the protein as does exposure to solvent of unpaired hydrogen bond donors or acceptors in the protein. There is a good correlation between the relative stabilizing effects of Ala and Gly at internal positions with the total change in solvent-accessible hydrophobic surface area of the folded protein on mutation of Ala----Gly. The relationship may be extended to the N and C-caps by including an extra term in hydrophilic surface area for the solvent exposure of the non-intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded main-chain CO, NH or protein side-chain hydrogen bonding groups. The requirement for solvent exposure of the C-cap main-chain CO groups may account for the strong preference for residues having positive phi and psi angles at this position, since this alpha L-conformation results in the largest solvent exposure of the C-terminal CO groups. Glycine in an alpha L-conformation results in the greatest exposure of these CO groups. Further, the side-chains of His, Asn, Arg and Lys may, with positive phi and psi-angles, form a hydrogen bond with the backbone CO of residue in position C -3 (residues are numbered relative to the C-cap). The preferences at the C-cap are Gly much greater than His greater than Asn greater than Arg greater than Lys greater than Ala approximately Ser approximately greater than Asp. The preferences at the N-cap are determined by hydrogen bonding of side-chains or solvent to the exposed backbone NH groups and are: Thr approximately Asp approximately Ser greater than Gly approximately Asn greater than Gln approximately Glu approximately His greater than Ala greater than Val much greater than Pro. These general trends may be obscured when mutation allows another side-chain to become a surrogate cap.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed for studying the thermal unfolding of myosin and its rod part prepared from carp acclimated to 10 and 30 degrees C. Differences in the thermal stability reflecting structural properties were clearly demonstrated by the DSC data obtained at pH 8.0 in 0.6 M KCl for the two types of carp myosin and rod. The transition temperatures on myosin and rod given by the major peaks for the 10 degrees C-acclimated carp were 33.9 and 47.4 degrees C and 33.0 and 44.0 degrees C, respectively, assuming two endotherms for this type. Since the shape of the first peaks at 33.9 and 33.0 degrees C was not symmetrical, two peaks having similar transition temperatures overlapped in this temperature range. When the data were analyzed using three endotherms, the three transition temperatures obtained for myosin and rod were 32.8, 34.9, and 47.4 degrees C and 32.9, 33.4, and 44.1 degrees C, respectively. Thus, the position of the first peak for the 10 degrees C-acclimated carp myosin did not change even after removal of the large subfragment-1 part, but the transition of the second peak shifted to a lower temperature by about 3 degrees C. The myosin and rod from carp acclimated to 30 degrees C showed three distinct peaks at 35.9, 39.7, and 49.1 degrees C and 34.5, 39.7, and 46.7 degrees C, respectively. The position of the largest peak for myosin remained unchanged, and the shift of the peak position of the highest temperature was about 3 degrees C, as obtained for the 10 degrees C-acclimated carp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The protein was chosen due to its functional properties and applications in food and pharmaceutical industries and because its structure and properties in aqueous solution have been widely described. The alcohols having a four carbon chain were selected to examine the effect of the gradual increase in the number of OH groups on protein stability. Protein thermal stability in water, buffers and dilute aqueous solutions of 1-butanol, 1,2-butanediol, 1,2,4-butanetriol and 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results were used to determine the temperature range in which the unfolding process is reversible and the protein denaturation temperature in acetate buffer pH 5.5 and in the aqueous mixed solvents. Thermodynamic results show that alcohol denaturating effect diminishes gradually as the number of OH groups increase.",

However, its inactivation in the presence of anionic surfactants is a problem which we have addressed by creating a complete saturation library. For this, the cutinase gene from Fusarium solani pisi was mutated to incorporate all 19 possible amino acid exchanges at each of the 214 amino acid positions. The resulting library was screened for active variants with improved stability in the presence of the anionic surfactant dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt (AOT). Twenty-four sites in cutinase were discovered where amino acid replacements resulted in a 2-11-fold stability increase as compared to the wild-type enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) is a major protein in hemolymph of adult Manduca sexta. Although it normally exists in a lipid-free state, during sustained flight, apoLp-III functions as an apolipoprotein, reversibly associating with the surface of lipoprotein particles. In an effort to gain a fuller understanding of this dual existence, we have investigated its solution properties using spectroscopic methods. The UV absorption spectrum of apoLp-III is distinctive owing to the absence of tryptophan and the presence of a single tyrosine residue. Circular dichroism experiments revealed an enhancement of apoLp-III alpha-helical content when spectra were obtained in 50% trifluoroethanol versus aqueous buffer. The helical content in buffer was unaffected by protein concentration, suggesting that apoLp-III exists in solution as a monomeric species. At pH values > 10 and < 4, there was a marked loss of helical content. Increasing the temperature of apoLp-III solutions also caused a loss of secondary structure, with a temperature-induced denaturation midpoint of 52 degrees C. Upon recooling of heat-denatured apoLp-III, approximately 95% of the secondary structure was restored. In guanidine HCl denaturation studies monitored by CD, a 50% transition midpoint of 0.355 M was determined, corresponding to a delta GDH2O of 1.29 kcal/mol. Fluorescence studies indicated that guanidine HCl induced an enhancement of tyrosine fluorescence emission at 300 nm when excited at 277 nm. In native apoLp-III, we propose that tyrosine fluorescence is quenched to a large extent due to a hydrophobic stacking interaction of its side chain with that of a neighboring phenylalanine residue. delta GDH2O was determined from the fluorescence data to be 2.1 kcal/mol, with a transition midpoint occurring at 0.25 M guanidine HCl. The lower concentration of guanidine HCl required to induce half-maximal tyrosine fluorescence enhancement versus the transition midpoint detected by CD may be a reflection of the fact that this residue is located near the COOH-terminal end of the protein and as such may be more susceptible to denaturation. The results presented indicate that apoLp-III assumes a relatively labile conformation in solution that appears to be partially stabilized by side chain charge-charge interactions within predicted alpha-helical segments.",

        "abstract": "Periplasmic protein disulfide isomerase (DsbA) from Escherichia coli is a strongly oxidizing thiol reagent with one catalytic disulfide bridge and an intrinsic redox potential of -0.089 V. Gel filtration experiments and analytical ultracentrifugation studies demonstrate that DsbA is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 21.1 kDa, independent of its redox state. In order to investigate the molecular basis of its redox properties, the guanidinium.chloride-induced folding/unfolding equilibrium of the reduced and the oxidized form of the enzyme were compared. The transitions at pH 7.0 and 30 degrees C were found to be fully reversible and allowed the calculation of the free energy of stabilization of oxidized and reduced DsbA according to a two-state model for the unfolding transition. The analysis reveals that reduced DsbA is 22.7 (+/- 4.0) kJ/mol more stable than oxidized DsbA. This energetic difference is essentially independent of temperature, although the overall free energies of stabilization of both oxidized and reduced DsbA vary strongly between 20 and 30 degrees C as a consequence of changes in the cooperativity of the transitions The conformational tension of 22.7 (+/- 4.0) kJ/mol in oxidized DsbA quantitatively explains the oxidizing properties of the protein, as it causes a change of redox equilibrium constants between DsbA and thiols of about four orders of magnitude, corresponding to an increase of the standard redox potential of 0.118 (+/- 0.021) V. We conclude that the oxidizing properties of DsbA mainly result from a tense conformation of its oxidized form, that is converted to the relaxed, reduced state upon oxidation of thiols by DsbA. The results are discussed in terms of a general principle underlying the oxidizing properties of protein disulfide isomerases.",

        "abstract": "Residues 75-78 form a tight turn within Omega-loop D in Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-cytochrome c. Directed, random mutagenesis of invariant residues proline 76 and glycine 77 in this turn were analyzed for the in vivo functionality and level of protein within the cell. All proteins, except Pro76Val, also exhibit a significant decrease in intracellular cytochrome c levels, ranging from 15% to 80% of wild type. Furthermore, all isolated mutant strains, except the one expressing Pro76Val, exhibit a significant decrease in growth on lactate medium, suggesting that the variant cytochromes are much less functional than wild type. This requirement for protein function is clearly the cause for the strict invariance of these residues in eukaryotic cytochromes c. Seven proteins with mutations just at Pro76 were purified and studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy. All proteins with mutations at Pro76 exhibit melting temperatures about 7 degreesC less than that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that mutation of Pro76 affects the entropy of the denatured state. It is proposed that the functional significance of Pro76 and Gly77 is the requirement for a type II (betagammaL) beta-turn in this loop, the conformation of which requires a glycine at the third position, and that a change occurs in this turn conformation upon a change in the redox state of the protein.",

        "abstract": "Ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) and mutants Gln25----Lys, Glu58----Ala, and the double mutant were prepared from a chemically synthesized gene, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The wild-type RNase T1 prepared from the cloned gene was identical in every functional and physical property examined to RNase T1 prepared from Aspergillus oryzae. Urea and thermal unfolding experiments show that Gln25----Lys is 0.9 kcal/mol more stable and Glu58----Ala is 0.8 kcal/mol less stable than wild-type RNase T1. In the double mutant, these contributions cancel and the stability does not differ significantly from that of wild-type RNase T1. For the double mutant, the dependence of delta G on urea concentration is significantly greater than for wild-type RNase T1 or the single mutants. This suggests that the double mutant unfolds more completely in urea than the other proteins. The activity of Gln25----Lys is identical with that of wild-type RNase T1. The activities of Glu58----Ala and the double mutant are 7% of wild-type when GpC hydrolysis is measured (due to a 35-fold decrease in kcat), and 37% of wild-type when RNA hydrolysis is measured. Thus, Glu58 is important, but not essential to the activity of RNase T1.",

        "abstract": "All known nucleoside monophosphate kinases contain an invariant sequence Asp-Gly-Phe(Tyr)-Pro-Arg. In order to understand better the structural and functional role of individual amino acid residues belonging to the above sequence, three mutants of Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (D84H, G85V, and F86L) were produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that the secondary structure dichroism spectra revealed that the secondary structure of all three mutant proteins is very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. However, each of the substitutions resulted in a decreased thermodynamic stability of the protein, as indicated by differential scanning calorimetry measurements and equilibrium unfolding experiments in guanidine HCl. The destabilizing effect was most pronounced for the G85V mutant, in which case the denaturation temperature was decreased by as much as 11 degrees C. The catalytic activity of the three mutants represented less than 1% of that of the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, for the D84H-modified form of adenylate kinase, the impaired binding of nucleotide substrates was accompanied by a markedly decreased affinity for magnesium ion. These observations support the notion that Asp84 is directly involved in binding of nucleotide substrates and that this binding is mediated by interaction of the aspartic acid residue with divalent cation. The two remaining residues probed in this study, Gly85 and Phe86, belong to a beta-turn which appears to play a major role in stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of adenylate kinase.",

Calorimetric and circular dichroism results reveal that in pH 9.0, 5 mM borate buffer, 200 mM NaCl, analogously to wild type BRCT, all three variants undergo partial thermal unfolding to a denatured state, which retains most of the native's structural characteristics. With respect to wild-type BRCT, the mutation M1775R induces the most severe effects especially upon the thermostability, while R1699W also has a strong impact. On the other hand, the thermal unfolding of variant V1833M is only moderately affected relative to wild-type BRCT. Moreover, isothermal titration calorimetric measurements reveal that contrary to M1775R and R1699W variants, V1833M binds to BACH1 and CtIP phosphopeptides.",

This cysteine is second next to the nucleophilic serine in the active site. We have individually modified seven residues to cysteine that are on two loops predicted to be within a 5 A radius. Four of them formed a disulfide bond to the endogenous cysteine. Thermal stability was monitored by circular dichroism and activity measurements. Global stability was similar to the wild-type enzyme. However, a significant increase in heat-stability was observed for the disulfide-containing variants using activity as a measure, together with a large reduction in catalytic rates (k(cat)) and a general decrease in Km values.

        "title": "Protein folding and stability of human CDK inhibitor p19(INK4d).", 
        "abstract": "P19(INK4d) is a tumor suppressing protein and belongs to a family of cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6, which play a key role in human cell cycle control. P19 comprises ten alpha-helices arranged sequentially in five ankyrin repeats forming an elongated structure. This rather simple topology, combined with its physiological function, makes p19 an interesting model protein for folding studies. Urea-induced unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD and phenylalanine fluorescence coincide and suggest a two-state mechanism for equilibrium unfolding. Unfolding of p19 followed by 2D (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra revealed a third species at moderate urea concentrations with a maximum population of about 30 % near 3.2 M urea. It shows poor chemical shift dispersion, but cross-peaks emerge for some residues that are distinct from the native or unfolded state. This equilibrium intermediate either arises only at high protein concentrations (as in the NMR experiment) or has similar optical properties to the unfolded state. Stopped-flow far-UV CD experiments at various urea concentrations revealed that alpha-helical structure is formed in three phases, of which only the fastest phase (10 s(-1)) depends upon the urea concentration. The kinetic of the slowest phase (0.017 s(-1)) can be resolved by 1D real-time NMR and accelerated by cyclophilin. It is limited in rate by prolyl isomerization, and native-like ordered structure cannot form prior to this isomerization. The two fast phases lead to 83 % native protein within the dead time of the NMR experiment. In contrast to p16(INK4a), which exhibits only a marginal stability and high unfolding rates, p19 shows the expected stability for a protein of this size with a clear kinetic barrier between the unfolded and folded state. Therefore, p19 might complement the function of less stable INK4 inhibitors in cell cycle control under unfavorable conditions.",

        "abstract": "Cys-231 of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) was selectively labeled with the mercury derivative of a stable nitroxyl radical. In 1.5 M guanidinium chloride, this conjugate exists in a molten globule state (MG), whereas in 5 M denaturant, it is in an unfolded state (U). The transition between the two states is reversible. In the MG, the label is highly immobilized, whereas in the U, it is almost freely rotating. The clearly distinct electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the two states permits the study of this transition. Upon elevating the guanidinium chloride concentration, a decrease in the EPR signal of the MG occurs concomitantly with an increase in the U signal, the total intensity of the EPR spectra remaining constant. This behavior is characteristic of a two-state transition. The thermodynamic characteristics of this transition (delta G0 and m), whether estimated directly from the EPR data or from both CD and fluorescence data analyzed by assuming a two-state scheme, are in good agreement.",

        "abstract": "The observation that denatured proteins yield scaling exponents, nu, consistent with random-coil behavior and yet can also have pockets of residual or nonrandom structure has been termed the \"reconciliation problem\". To provide greater insight into the denatured state of a foldable sequence, we have measured histidine-heme loop formation equilibria in the denatured state of a class II c-type cytochrome, cytochrome c' from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. We have prepared a series of variants that provide His-heme loop stabilities, pK(loop)(His), for loop sizes ranging from 10 to 111 residues at intervals of 7 to 11 residues along the sequence of the protein. We observe a scaling exponent for loop formation, nu(3), of 2.5+/-0.3. Theoretical values for nu(3) range from 1.8 to 2.4; thus, the observed nu(3) is consistent with random-coil behavior. However, in contrast to data for loop formation as a function of loop size obtained with peptides of homogeneous sequence, we observe considerable scatter about the linear dependence of loop stability on loop size. Thus, foldable sequences behave very differently from homogeneous peptide sequences. The observed scatter suggests that there is considerable variation in the conformational properties along the backbone of a foldable sequence, consistent with alternating compact and extended regions. With regard to the reconciliation problem, it is evident that a scaling exponent consistent with a random coil is necessary but not sufficient to demonstrate random-coil behavior.",

        "abstract": "Immunoglobulin variable domains are generally thought of as well conserved platforms providing the base for antigen binding loops of highly varying sequence and structure. However, domain evolution must ensure a balance between optimizing antigen affinity and the requirements of a stable, cooperatively folding domain. Since random mutations can carry a significant penalty for domain stability, constraints are imposed both on the repertoire of germline sequences and on somatic amino acid replacements during affinity maturation. Analyzing these constraints in the conceptual framework of statistical mechanics, we have been able to predict stabilizing mutations in the McPC603 V kappa domain from sequence information alone with better than 60% success rate. The validity of this concept not only has far reaching implications for antibody engineering but may also be generalized to engineer other proteins for higher stability.",

        "abstract": "Thermal and chemical unfolding of lipid-free apolipoprotein C-1 (apoC-1), a 6-kDa protein component of very low density and high-density lipoproteins, was analyzed by far-UV CD. In neutral 1 mM Na2HPO4 solutions containing 6-7 micrograms/mL protein, the apoC-1 monomer is approximately 30% alpha-helical at 0-22 degrees C and unfolds reversibly from about 22-80 degrees C with Tm = 51 +/- 3 degrees C and van't Hoff enthalpy delta Hv(Tm) = 19 +/- 3 kcal/mol. The apparent free energy of the monomer stabilization determined from the chemical unfolding at 0 degree C, delta G(0 degree C) = 2.8 +/- 0.8 kcal/mol, decreases by about 1 kcal/mol upon heating to 25 degrees C. A small apparent heat capacity increment suggests the absence of a substantial hydrophobic core for the apoC-1 molecule. At pH 7, increasing apoC-1 concentration above 10 micrograms/mL leads to self-association and formation of additional alpha-helices that unfold upon both heating and cooling from room temperature. The CD data indicate that the high-temperature transition reflects a complete monomer unfolding and the low-temperature transition reflects oligomer dissociation into stable monomers. This suggests the importance of hydrophobic interactions for apoC-1 self-association. Close proximity between the high- and low-temperature transitions and the absence of a plateau in the chemical unfolding curves recorded from oligomeric apoC-1 indicate marginal oligomer stability and suggest that in vivo apoC-1 transfer is mediated via the complexes with other apolipoproteins and/or lipids.",

        "abstract": "Antibodies are modular proteins consisting of domains that exhibit a beta-sandwich structure, the so-called immunoglobulin fold. Despite structural similarity, differences in folding and stability exist between different domains. In particular, the variable domain of the light chain V(L) is unusual as it is associated with misfolding diseases, including the pathologic assembly of the protein into fibrillar structures. Here, we have analysed the folding pathway of a V(L) domain with a view to determine features that may influence the relationship between productive folding and fibril formation. The V(L) domain from MAK33 (murine monoclonal antibody of the subtype kappa/IgG1) has not previously been associated with fibrillisation but is shown here to be capable of forming fibrils. The folding pathway of this V(L) domain is complex, involving two intermediates in different pathways. An obligatory early molten globule-like intermediate with secondary structure but only loose tertiary interactions is inferred. The native state can then be formed directly from this intermediate in a phase that can be accelerated by the addition of prolyl isomerases. However, an alternative pathway involving a second, more native-like intermediate is also significantly populated. Thus, the protein can reach the native state via two distinct folding pathways. Comparisons to the folding pathways of other antibody domains reveal similarities in the folding pathways; however, in detail, the folding of the V(L) domain is striking, with two intermediates populated on different branches of the folding pathway, one of which could provide an entry point for molecules diverted into the amyloid pathway.",

Although the far-u.v. CD spectra of the thermally denatured proteins differed from those of the completely denatured states in 3.2 M guanidine hydrochloride, the titration curves by denaturants at higher temperatures were not sigmoidal but straight lines, indicating that the cooperative structure of the proteins has been completely destroyed by heating. The ratio of calorimetric enthalpy change to van't Hoff enthalpy change obtained from calorimetric study was unity, indicating that the thermal denaturation of the proteins was a two-state system. The unfolding heat capacity change (delta Cp) of the wild-type protein from van't Hoff analysis of the thermal denaturation curves by CD measurement was estimated to be 2.45 kcal/mol X deg, which was similar to that from calorimetry.

Single and double Trp-Phe mutants of IIABMan and of the IIA domain were produced. Fluorescence emission studies revealed that Trp33 and Trp12 are the major fluorescence emitters, Trp69 is strongly quenched in the native protein and Trp182 strongly blue shifted, indicative of a hydrophobic environment. Stabilities of the Trp mutants of dimeric IIA(Man) and IIAB(Man) were estimated from midpoints of the GdmHCl-induced unfolding transitions and from the amount of dimers that resisted dissociation by SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), respectively. W12F exhibited increased stability, but only 6% of the wild-type phosphotransferase activity, whereas W33F was marginally and W69F significantly destabilized, but fully active. Second site mutations W33F and W69F in the background of the W12F mutation reduced protein stability and suppressed the functional defect of W12F. These results suggest that flexibility is required for the adjustments of protein-protein contacts necessary for the phosphoryltransfer between the phosphorylcarrier protein HPr, IIA(Man), IIB(Man), and the incoming mannose bound to the transmembrane IIC(Man)-IID(Man) complex.",

Unfolding of oxidized and reduced cytochrome c553 by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) was monitored by circular dichroism (CD) and Soret absorption; the same unfolding curves were obtained with both methods supporting that cytochrome c553 unfolds by an apparent two-state process. Reduced cytochrome c553 is 7(3) kJ/mol more stable than the oxidized form; accordingly, the reduction potential of unfolded cytochrome c553 is 100(20) mV more negative than that of the folded protein. In contrast to many other unfolded cytochrome c proteins, upon unfolding at pH 7.0 both oxidized and reduced heme in cytochrome c553 become high-spin. The lack of heme misligation in unfolded cytochrome c553 implies that its unfolded structure is less constrained than those of cytochromes c with low-spin, misligated hemes.",

        "abstract": "The structure of alpha-helix 1 (residues 6-18) in the transition state for the unfolding of barnase has been previously characterized by comparing the kinetics and thermodynamics of folding of wild-type protein with those of mutants whose side chains have been cut back, in the main, to that of alanine. The structure of the transition state has now been explored further by comparing the kinetics and thermodynamics of folding of glycine mutants with those of the alanine mutants at solvent-exposed positions in the alpha-helices of barnase. Such \"Ala-->Gly scanning\" provides a general procedure for examining the structure of solvent-exposed regions in the transition state. A gradual change of structure of the transition state was detected as helix 1 becomes increasingly destabilized on mutation. The extent of change of structure of helix 1 in the transition state for the mutant proteins was probed by a further round of Ala-->Gly scanning of those mutants. Destabilization of the helix 1 was found to cause the overall transition state for unfolding to become closer in structure to that of the folded protein. This is analogous to the conventional Hammond effect in physical-organic chemistry whereby the transition state moves parallel to the reaction coordinate with change in structure. But, paradoxically, the structure of helix 1 itself becomes less folded in the transition state as helix 1 becomes destabilized. This is analogous, however, to the rarer anti-Hammond effect in which there is movement perpendicular to the reaction coordinate. These observations are rationalized by plotting correlation diagrams of degree of formation of individual elements of structure against the degree of formation of overall structure in the transition state. There is a relatively smooth movement of the degree of compactness in the transition state against changes in activation energy on mutation that suggests a smooth movement of the transition state along the energy surface on mutation rather than a switch between two different parallel pathways. The results are consistent with the transition state having closely spaced energy levels. Helix 1, which appears to be an initiation point and forms early in the folding of wild-type protein, may be radically destabilized to the extent that it forms late in the folding of mutants. The order of events in folding may thus not be crucial.",

        "title": "Protein stability as a function of denaturant concentration: the thermal stability of barnase in the presence of urea.", 
        "abstract": "The conventional procedure for analyzing urea denaturation curves assumes that the free energy of unfolding (delta GU-F) is linearly related to [urea] that is, delta GU-F = delta GH2O(U-F)--m[urea], where m is a constant, specific for each protein, and delta GH2O(U-F) is the free energy of unfolding in water. This relationship can be measured directly, however, over only a small concentration range of approximately +/- 0.8 M urea around the midpoint of the unfolding transition. A nagging discrepancy (1.6 kcal mol-1) between delta GH2O(U-F) at 298 K of barnase extrapolated from such an equation and the equivalent value obtained from thermal unfolding measurements has stimulated a re-evaluation of the equation. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements have been made of the thermal unfolding of barnase in the presence of concentrations of urea between 0 and 4.5 M, the midpoint of the unfolding transition at 298 K, to test the denaturation equation over a wide range of [urea]. Values for delta GU-F at 298 K (delta G298U-F) for each concentration of urea were extrapolated from the calorimetrically measured enthalpies and the denaturational heat capacity change (delta Cdp) measured for that concentration of urea. A plot of delta G298U-F against [urea] deviates systematically from linearity and fits better the equation: delta G298U-F = 10.5 +/- 0.08 - ((2.65 +/- 0.05) x [urea]) + ((0.08 +/- 0.01) x [urea]2) kcal mol-1. The curvature in the plot leads to apparent values of m that increase when measurements are made at lower concentrations of urea. This could account for increases in m at low values of pH or in destabilized mutants since the protein denatures at lower concentrations of urea. It has been shown previously that small curvature in the free energy of unfolding versus [urea] leads to negligible errors in measurements of delta delta GU-F, the change in free energy of unfolding on mutation, providing that the curvature is similar for all mutants. The calorimetrically measured enthalpies of unfolding are decreased in the presence of urea while delta Cdp is increased. Both of these observations are consistent with an overall exothermic interaction between urea and protein with a net increase on unfolding.",

        "abstract": "The structure of the mutant of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme in which Gly-156 is replaced by aspartic acid is described. The lysozyme was isolated by screening for temperature-sensitive mutants and has a melting temperature at pH 6.5 that is 6.1 degrees C lower than wild type. The mutant structure is destabilized, in part, because Gly-156 has conformational angles (phi, psi) that are not optimal for a residue with a beta-carbon. High resolution crystallographic refinement of the mutant structure (R = 17.7% at 1.7 A resolution) shows that the Gly----Asp substitution does not significantly alter the configurational angles (phi, psi) but forces the backbone to move, as a whole, approximately 0.6 A away from its position in wild-type lysozyme. This induced strain weakens a hydrogen bond network that exists in the wild-type structure and also contributes to the reduced stability of the mutant lysozyme. The introduction of an acidic side chain reduces the overall charge on the molecule and thereby tends to increase the stability of the mutant structure relative to wild type. However, at neutral pH this generalized electrostatic stabilization is offset by specific electrostatic repulsion between Asp-156 and Asp-92. The activity of the mutant lysozyme is approximately 50% that of wild-type lysozyme. This reduction in activity might be due to introduction of a negative charge and/or perturbation of the surface of the molecule in the region that is assumed to interact with peptidoglycan substrates.",

        "abstract": "The KM+ lectin exhibits a novel and unusual circular dichroism (CD) spectrum that could be explained by a high proline content that would be inducing deformation of the beta-structure and/or unusual turns. KM+ was shown to be a very rigid lectin, which was very stable under a broad variety of conditions (urea, guanidine, hydrolysis, pH, etc.). Only incubation for 60 min at 333-338 K and extreme basic pH were able to induce conformational changes which could be observed by CD and fluorescence measurements. Data from CD are typical for protein denaturing associated with changes in the overall secondary structure. Data from high-performance size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that the denatured forms produced at pH 12.0 are eluted in clusters that co-elute with the native forms. A significant contribution from the tyrosines to the fluorescence emission upon denaturation was observed above 328 K. In fact at 328 K some broadening of the emission spectrum takes place followed by the appearance of a shoulder (approx. 305 nm) at 333 K and above. The sensitivity of tryptophan fluorescence to the addition of sugar suggests a close proximity of the tryptophan residues to the sugar binding site, K(a)=(2.9+/-0.6)x10(3) M(-1). The fraction of chromophore accessible to the quencher obtained is f(a)=0.43+/-0.08, suggesting that approximately 50% of the tryptophan residues are not accessible to quenching by d-mannose. KM+ thermal denaturation was found to be irreversible and was analyzed using a two-state model (N-->D). The results obtained for the activation energy and transition temperature from the equilibrium CD studies were: activation energy, E(a)=134+/-11 kJ/mol and transition temperature, T(m)=339+/-1 K, and from the fluorescence data: E(a)=179+/-18 kJ/mol and T(m)=337+/-1 K.

        "abstract": "Diverse Gram-negative bacteria use type III secretion systems (T3SS) to translocate effector proteins into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) consists of a basal body spanning both bacterial membranes and an external needle. A sensor protein lies at the needle tip to detect environmental signals that trigger type III secretion. The Shigella flexneri T3SA needle tip protein, invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD), possesses two independently folding domains in vitro. In this study, the solution behavior and thermal unfolding properties of IpaD's functional homologs SipD (Salmonella spp.), BipD (Burkholderia pseudomallei), LcrV (Yersinia spp.), and PcrV (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were examined to identify common features within this protein family. CD and FTIR data indicate that all members within this group are alpha-helical with properties consistent with an intramolecular coiled-coil. SipD showed the most complex unfolding profile consisting of two thermal transitions, suggesting the presence of two independently folding domains. No evidence of multiple folding domains was seen, however, for BipD, LcrV, or PcrV. Thermal studies, including DSC, revealed significant destabilization of LcrV, PcrV, and BipD after N-terminal deletions. This contrasted with SipD and IpaD, which behaved like two-domain proteins. The results suggest that needle tip proteins share significant core structural similarity and thermal stability that may be the basis for their common function. Moreover, IpaD and SipD possess properties that distinguish them from the other tip proteins.",

        "abstract": "beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is one of the main protein components of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta readily aggregates to forms fibrils and other aggregated species that have been shown to be toxic in a number of studies. In particular, soluble oligomeric forms are closely related to neurotoxicity. However, the relationship between neurotoxicity and the size of Abeta aggregates or oligomers is still under investigation. In this article, we show that different Abeta incubation conditions in vitro can affect the rate of Abeta fibril formation, the conformation and stability of intermediates in the aggregation pathway, and toxicity of aggregated species formed. When gently agitated, Abeta aggregates faster than Abeta prepared under quiescent conditions, forming fibrils. The morphology of fibrils formed at the end of aggregation with or without agitation, as observed in electron micrographs, is somewhat different. Interestingly, intermediates or oligomers formed during Abeta aggregation differ greatly under agitated and quiescent conditions. Unfolding studies in guanidine hydrochloride indicate that fibrils formed under quiescent conditions are more stable to unfolding in detergent than aggregation associated oligomers or Abeta fibrils formed with agitation. In addition, Abeta fibrils formed under quiescent conditions were less toxic to differentiated SH-SY5Y cells than the Abeta aggregation associated oligomers or fibrils formed with agitation. These results highlight differences between Abeta aggregation intermediates formed under different conditions and provide insight into the structure and stability of toxic Abeta oligomers.",

        "abstract": "Nine single substitution cysteine mutants of staphylococcal nuclease (nuclease) were preferentially crosslinked at the introduced cysteine residues using three different bifunctional crosslinking reagents; 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (BMH), 1,3-dibromo-2-propanol (DBP), and the chemical warfare agent, mustard gas (bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide; mustard). BMH and mustard gas are highly specific reagents for cysteine residues, whereas DBP is not as specific. Guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) denaturations of the resulting dimeric proteins exhibited biphasic unfolding behavior that did not fit the two-state model of unfolding. The monofunctional reagent, epsilon-maleimidocaproic acid (MCA), was used as a control for the effects of alkylation. Proteins modified with MCA unfolded normally, showing that this unusual unfolding behavior is due to crosslinking. The data obtained from these crosslinked dimers was fitted to a three-state thermodynamic model of two successive transitions in which the individual subunits cooperatively unfold. These two unfolding transitions were very different from the unfolding of the monomeric protein. These differences in unfolding behavior can be attributed in large part to changes in the denatured state. In addition to GuHCl titrations, the crosslinked dimers were also thermally unfolded. In contrast to the GuHCl denaturations, analysis of this data fit a two-state model well, but with greatly elevated van't Hoff enthalpies in many cases. However, clear correlations between the thermal and GuHCl denaturations exist, and the differences in thermal unfolding can be rationalized by postulating interactions of the denatured crosslinked proteins.",

Variants Y12A and Y12I were expressed to reasonable levels in cells grown at lower temperatures, but decomposed during purification. Variants Y12F, Y12H, and Y12W were substantially destabilized with respect to the recombinant wild-type HiPIP (rcWT) as determined by differential scanning calorimetry over a pH range of 7.0-11.0. Characterization of the Y12F variant by NMR indicates that the principal structural differences between this variant and the rcWT HiPIP result from the loss of the two hydrogen bonds of the Tyr-12 hydroxyl group with Asn-14 O delta 1 and Lys-59 NH, respectively. The effect of the loss of the latter interaction is propagated through the Lys-59/Val-58 peptide bond, thereby perturbing Gly-46. The delta delta GDapp of Y12F of 2.3 kcal/mol with respect to rcWT HiPIP (25 degrees C, pH 7.0) is entirely consistent with the contribution of these two hydrogen bonds to the stability of the latter. CD measurements show that Tyr-12 influences several electronic transitions within the cluster. The midpoint reduction potentials of variants Y12F, Y12H, and Y12W were 17, 19, and 22 mV (20 mM MOPS, 0.2 M sodium chloride, pH 6.98, 25 degrees C), respectively, higher than that of rcWT HiPIP. The current results indicate that, although conserved Tyr-12 modulates the properties of the cluster, its principle function is to stabilize the HiPIP through hydrogen bonds involving its hydroxyl group and electrostatic interactions involving its aromatic ring.",

        "abstract": "Human ceruloplasmin (CP) is a multicopper oxidase essential for normal iron homeostasis. The protein has six domains with one type-1 copper in each of domains 2, 4, and 6; the remaining coppers form a catalytic trinuclear cluster at the interface between domains 1 and 6. To assess the role of the coppers in CP thermal stability, we have probed the thermal unfolding process as a function of scan rate of holo- and apo-forms using several detection methods (circular dichroism, aromatic and 8-anilino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid fluorescence, visible absorption, activity, and differential scanning calorimetry). Both species of CP undergo irreversible thermal reactions to denatured states with significant residual structure. For identical scan rates, the thermal midpoint appears at temperatures 15-20 degrees higher for the holo- as compared with the apo- form. The thermal data for both forms were fit by a mechanistic model involving two consecutive, irreversible steps (N --> I --> D). The holo-intermediate, I, has lost one oxidized type-1 copper and secondary structure in at least one domain; however, the trinuclear copper cluster remains intact as it is functional in oxidase activity. The activation parameters obtained from the fits to the thermal transitions were used to assess the kinetic stability of apo- and holo-CP at physiological temperatures (i.e., at 37 degrees C). It emerges that native CP (i.e., with six coppers) is rather unstable and converts to I in <1 day at 37 degrees C. Nonetheless, this form remains intact for more than 2 weeks and may thus be a biologically relevant state of CP in vivo. In contrast, apo-CP unfolds rapidly: the denatured state is reached in <2 days at 37 degrees C.",

        "abstract": "Site-directed mutagenesis and detailed fluorescence studies were used to study the structure and dynamics of recombinant human proapolipoprotein (proapo) A-I in the lipid free state and in reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) particles. Five different mutants of proapoA-I, each containing a single tryptophan residue, were produced in bacteria corresponding to each of the naturally occurring Trp residues (position -3 in the pro-segment, 8, 50, 72, and 108) in the N-terminal half of the protein. Structural analyses indicated that the conservative Phe-Trp substitutions did not perturb the conformation of the mutants with respect to the wild-type protein. Steady-state fluorescence studies indicated that all of the Trp residues exist in nonpolar environments that are highly protected from solvent in both the lipid-free and lipid-bound forms. Time-resolved lifetime and anisotropy studies indicated that the shape of the monomeric form of proapoA-I is a prolate ellipsoid with an axial ratio of about 6:1. In addition, the region surrounding Trp 108 appears to be more mobile than the rest of the protein in the lipid-free state. However, in rHDL particles, no significant domain motion was detected for any of the Trp residues. The results presented in this work are consistent with a model for monomeric lipid-free proapoA-I in which the N-terminal half of the molecule is organized into a bundle of helices.",

        "abstract": "The guanidine hydrochloride- (GuHCl-) induced unfolding and refolding of a recombinant domain of bovine microsomal cytochrome b(5) containing the first 104 amino acid residues has been characterized by both transient and equilibrium spectrophotometric methods. The soluble domain is reversibly unfolded and the equilibrium reaction may be monitored by changes in absorbance and fluorescence that accompany denaturation of the native protein. Both probes reveal a single cooperative transition with a midpoint at 3 M GuHCl and lead to a value for the protein stability (DeltaG(uw)) of 26.5 kJ mol(-1). This stability is much higher than that reported for the corresponding form of the apoprotein (approximately 7 kJ mol(-1)). Transient changes in fluorescence and absorbance during protein unfolding exhibit biphasic profiles. A fast phase occupying approximately 30% of the total amplitude is observed at high denaturant concentrations and becomes the dominant process within the transition region. The rates associated with each process show a linear dependency on GuHCl concentration, and at zero denaturant concentration the unfolding rates (k(uw)) are 4.5 x 10(-5) s(-1) and 5.2 x 10(-6) s(-1) at 25 degrees C. The pattern of unfolding is not correlated with covalent heterogeneity, since a wide range of variants and site-directed mutants exhibit identical profiles, nor is the unfolding correlated with cis-trans Pro isomerization in the native state. In comparison with the apo form of cytochrome b(5), the kinetics of refolding and unfolding are more complex and exhibit very different transition states. The data support a model for unfolding in which heme-protein interactions give rise to two discernible rates of unfolding. From an analysis of the activation parameters associated with each process it is established that two structurally similar transition states differing by less than 5 kJ mol(-1) exist in the unfolding reaction. Protein refolding exhibits monophasic kinetics but with distinct curvature apparent in plots of ln k(obs) versus denaturant concentration. The data are interpreted in terms of alternative routes for protein folding in which a \"fast track\" leads to the rapid ordering of structure around Trp26 for refolding while a slower route requires additional reorganization around the hydrophobic core.",

The other physicochemical properties of the mutant protein in the native state were not different from those of the wild-type protein. However, the equilibrium and kinetic stabilities of the mutant protein were remarkably decreased due to the introduction of a polar residue (Thr) in the interior of the molecule.

Analysis of the equilibrium stability and unfolding kinetics of 19 variants that span all eight beta-strands of this 163-residue protein revealed that the transition-state structure is a highly polarized, partly formed beta-barrel.

Two conservative mutants were constructed and expressed that contained W25-->F and W25-->Y substitutions. The binding (dissociation) constants (Kd) for three ligands, viz., 6-aminohexanoic acid (EACA), 7-aminoheptanoic acid (7-AHpA), and L-lysine (Lys), to these polypeptides were determined by intrinsic fluorescence titrations. In the case of r-[K2tPA/W25F], the Kd values for these ligands were found to be 37, 16, and 89 microM for EACA, 7-AHpA, and Lys, respectively. For r-[K2tPA/W25Y], the Kd values for these same ligands were 64, 9, and 115 microM, respectively. The wild-type (wt) kringle domain possessed Kd values of 43, 6, and 85 microM for EACA, 7-AHpA, and Lys, respectively. The effect of these mutations on the stability of the r-[K2tPA] domain has been examined by differential scanning colorimetry. The temperature of maximum heat capacity (Tm) of wt-r-[K2tPA] (75.6 degrees C) was dramatically reduced to 50.8 and 58.0 degrees C for r-[K2tPA/W25F] and r-[K2tPA/W25Y], respectively. In the presence of EACA, the Tm values were increased to 86.1, 61.7, and 68.7 degrees C, respectively, indicating that EACA does interact with the r-[K2tPA] mutants and stabilizes their native conformations, similar to the case with wt-r-[K2tPA].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Whereas horse apomyoglobin is fully unfolded at pH 2 in the absence of salt, addition of a salt such as sodium chloride or sodium trichloroacetate stabilizes the molten globule state. Thermal unfolding of the salt-stabilized molten globule states of horse apomyoglobin at pH 2 measured by far-UV circular dichroism occurs not only on heating (i.e. heat-denaturation) but also on cooling (i.e. cold-denaturation). This demonstrates that a hydrophobic interaction contributes to the stability of the molten globule state and suggests that the unfolding transition can be represented by a cooperative two-state mechanism. To clarify the mechanism of conformational transition, we investigated the thermal unfolding of the chloride-stabilized molten globule state by differential scanning calorimetry. We observed a broad but distinct excess heat capacity peak, which is consistent with the unfolding transition measured by circular dichroism. To further characterize the molten globule states, we examined by far-UV circular dichroism the denaturant-induced unfolding transitions of the molten globule states stabilized by sodium chloride or sodium trichloroacetate. The urea-induced unfolding transitions of the molten globule states were explained by the two-state mechanism. The guanidine-hydrochloride-induced unfolding experiments clarified that the trichloroacetate-stabilized molten globule state is distinct from the chloride-stabilized one and that the former involves additional helical segment(s). These results support a view that the thermal unfolding of the molten globule states at pH 2 can be approximated by a two-state transition. However, several results suggested that a combined mechanism incorporating the two-state transition and a gradual structural change would be more general in describing the conformational transition of the molten globule states.",

It has been shown that with urea and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) some proteins exhibit denaturant-independent (DeltaG(degrees)(N-->D)). But with several other proteins urea and GdnHCl give different (DeltaG(degrees)(N-->D)) values for the same protein, meaning that the free energy difference between N and D is not the only contribution to one or both (DeltaG(degrees)(N-->D)) values. Using beta1, a mutant form of the protein G B1 domain, we show that both urea- and GdnHCl-induced denaturations are two-state and reversible but that the denaturants give different values for (DeltaG(degrees)(N-->D)). While spectral observables are sensitive to the shift between N and D states (between states effect), they are not sensitive to denaturant-induced changes that occur within the individual N and D states (within state effect). By contrast, nonspectral observables such as Stokes radius and thermodynamic observables such as proton uptake/release are often sensitive to both \"between states\" and \"within state\" effects. These observables, along with spectral measurements, provide descriptions of urea- and GdnHCl-induced denaturation of beta1. Our results suggest that in the predenaturation concentration range GdnHCl changes the free energy of the native ensemble in a nonlinear manner but that urea does not. As with RNase A and beta-lactoglobulin, beta1 exhibits variable two-state behavior with GdnHCl-induced denaturation in that the free energy of the native ensemble in the predenaturation zone changes (varies) with GdnHCl concentration in a nonlinear manner.",

Replacement of His48 by lysine (H48K) gives rise to a protein having a distorted lipid binding pocket. Activity of this variant drops below the detection limit which is 10(7)-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand, the presence of glutamine (H48Q) or asparagine (H48N) at this position does not affect the structural integrity of the enzyme as can be derived from the preserved lipid binding properties of these variants. However, the substitutions H48Q and H48N strongly reduce the turnover number, i.e. by a factor of 10(5). Residual activity is totally lost after addition of a competitive inhibitor. We conclude that proper lipid binding on its own accelerates ester bond hydrolysis by a factor of 10(2). With the selected variants, we were also able to dissect the contribution of the hydrogen bond between Asp99 and His48 on conformational stability, being 5.2 kJ/mol. Another hydrogen bond with His48 is formed when the competitive inhibitor (R)-2-dodecanoylamino-hexanol-1-phosphoglycol interacts with the enzyme.

        "abstract": "In order to increase understanding of the basis of the stability of the native conformational state of porcine pepsin A, a strategy based on induction and monitoring of protein denaturation was developed. Structural perturbation was achieved by adding acetonitrile (MeCN) to the protein-solvent system. MeCN was found to induce non-coincident disruption of the secondary and tertiary structural features of pepsin A. It is proposed that gross unfolding is prompted by disruption of the protein hydration pattern induced by the organic co-solvent. It should be noted that the functional properties and thermal stability of the protein were already impaired before the onset of global unfolding. Low and intermediate contents of MeCN in the protein-solvent system affected the sharpness of the thermal transition and the degree of residual structure of the heat-denatured state. The importance of hydration to the conformational stability of pepsin A in its biologically active state is discussed.",

        "title": "The expression of bovine microsomal cytochrome b5 in Escherichia coli and a study of the solution structure and stability of variant proteins.", 
        "abstract": "The DNA sequence of bovine microsomal cytochrome b5 has been amplified from a liver cDNA library using a polymerase chain reaction. The amplified cDNA when cloned into plasmids that support the high-level production of cytochrome b5 in E.coli leads to protein overexpression and results in cell colonies bearing a strong red colouration. Using cassette mutagenesis, truncated versions of the cytochrome b5 cDNA have been made that encode the first 90 amino acid residues (Ala1-Lys90), the first 104 amino acids (Ala1-Ser104) and the complete protein (Ala1-Asn133). The location of the overexpressed cytochrome b5 within prokaryotic cells is dependent on the overall length of the protein. Expression of the Ala-Lys90 and Ala1-Ser104 variants leads to a location in the cytoplasmic phase of the bacteria whereas the whole protein, Ala1-Asn133, is found within the bacterial membrane fraction. The last 30 residues of cytochrome b5 therefore contain all of the necessary information to insert the protein into E.coli membranes. The solubility of the Ala1-Ser104 variant permits the solution structure and stability of this protein to be measured using 1- and 2-D 1H-NMR methods and electronic spectroscopy. 1-D NMR studies show that the chemical shifts of the haem and haem ligand resonances of the Ala1-Ser104 variant exhibit only very slight perturbations to their magnetic microenvironments when compared with the tryptic fragment of ferricytochrome b5. These results indicate an arrangement of residues in the haem pocket that is very similar in both the Ala1-Ser104 variant and the tryptic fragment and by 2-D NMR it is shown that this similarity extends to the conformations of the polypeptide backbone and side chains. Electronic spectroscopy of this variant shows absorbance maxima for the Soret peaks at 423 nm (reduced) and 413 nm (oxidized). From absorbance spectra the relative thermal stabilities of the Ala1-Ser104 variant and the tryptic fragment were measured. In the oxidized state the Ala1-Ser104 variant denatures in a single cooperative transition with a midpoint temperature (Tm) of 73 degrees C that is significantly higher than that of 'tryptic' ferricytochrome b5. The reduced form of the protein shows increased transition temperatures (Tm approximately 78 degrees C) reflected in the values of delta Hm, delta Sm and delta(delta G) of 420 kJ/mol, 1096 J/mol/K and 12.38 kJ/mol respectively, estimated for this variant. The increased stability of the Ala1-Ser104 variant and other recombinant forms of cytochrome b5 is correlated with the presence of additional residues at the N- and C-termini.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "CheY, the 129 amino acid chemotactic protein from Escherichia coli, is a good model for studying the folding process of the parallel alpha/beta family of proteins. A study of the folding kinetics of CheY using fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) stopped-flow measurements is reported. CheY has three prolines, two of them in the trans conformation and one, Pro110, with a cis Lys-Pro peptide bond. This protein presents a unimolecular, but complex, kinetic mechanism that is dominated by a slow phase compatible with a trans-cis isomerization. Mutation of Pro110 to Gly results in the disappearance of this slow phase, indicating that this cis prolyl bond is responsible for it. The slow phase is catalyzed in a very inefficient way by prolyl isomerase, indicating that the cis bond is poorly accessible to the enzyme during refolding. In agreement with this is the fact that the isomerization of the Lys109-Pro110 bond occurs in an intermediate which contains 96% of the native far-UV CD signal and 80% of the native fluorescence signal. Analysis of the unfolded protein with all its prolines in the native conformation shows the existence of a very stable intermediate in the folding reaction. Mutation of a hyperexposed hydrophobic residue, Phe14, to Asn results in an increase in the free energy of unfolding of the protein of approximately 3 kcal mol-1. Kinetic analysis of the unfolding and refolding reactions of this mutant indicates that the major stabilization effect comes from the relative destabilization of the unfolded state and the kinetic intermediate with respect to the transition state, providing kinetic evidence for the inverse hydrophobic effect. This could also indicate the existence of nonnative interactions in folding intermediates.",

Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsic secondary structure of the trigger site is largely stabilized by an intrahelical salt bridge. Removal of this surface salt bridge by a single amino acid mutation induced only minor changes in the backbone structure of the GCN4 leucine zipper dimer as verified by nuclear magnetic resonance. The mutation, however, substantially destabilized the dimeric structure. These findings support the proposed hierarchic folding mechanism of the GCN4 coiled coil in which local helix formation within the trigger segment precedes dimerization.",

        "abstract": "Structural studies on mammalian integral membrane proteins have long been hampered by their instability in detergent. This is particularly true for the agonist conformation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), where it is thought that the movement of helices that occurs upon agonist binding results in a looser and less stable packing in the protein. Here, we show that mutagenesis coupled to a specific selection strategy can be used to stabilize the agonist and antagonist conformations of the adenosine A(2a) receptor. Of the 27 mutations identified that improve the thermostability of the agonist conformation, only three are also present in the 17 mutations identified that improve the thermostability of the antagonist conformation, suggesting that the selection strategies used were specific for each conformation. Combination of the stabilizing mutations for the antagonist- or agonist-binding conformations resulted in mutants that are more stable at higher temperatures than the wild-type receptor by 17 degrees C and 9 degrees C, respectively. The mutant receptors both showed markedly improved stability in short-chain alkyl-glucoside detergents compared with the wild-type receptor, which will facilitate their structural analysis.",

        "abstract": "The biological role of human paraoxonase (PON1) remains unclear, whilst there is a consensus that the enzyme has a protective influence. A toxicological role, protecting from environmental poisoning by organophosphate derivatives drove earlier works, and more recently, clinical interest has focused on a protective role in vascular disease. PON1 resides essentially on HDL particles, a complex and dynamic molecular environment. Our recent discovery of the human phosphate binding protein (HPBP), displaying a firm propensity to associate with PON1, has steered new directions for characterizing PON1 functional state. Here, we report investigations on the effect of HPBP on oligomerization, storage and thermal stability of PON1. We found that purified PON1 is as a mixture of at least two states, and that the absence of HPBP favors homo-oligomerization of PON1 into state(s) of higher molecular size. We showed that HPBP allows stabilizing active conformation(s) of PON1 disencumbered of its natural environment. We also showed that PON1 exhibits intrinsically a remarkable thermal stability, and that the association of HPBP strongly contributes to slow the denaturation rate. A hybrid recombinant PON1 was shown more thermostable than the human enzyme, and its stability was unaffected by the presence of HPBP. Altogether, the results strongly encourage further study of the human enzyme.",

        "abstract": "The chemical unfolding behavior of porcine beta-lactoglobulin (PLG) has been followed at pH 2 and 6 in the presence of guanidinium hydrochloride. The PLG unfolding transition, monitored by tryptophan fluorescence, far and near UV circular dichroism and 1D-NMR, can be described by a three-state transition suggesting the presence of at least one intermediate state that appears to display an excess of non-native alpha-helical structures. The thermodynamic parameters, as determined through a global analysis fitting procedure, give estimates of the free energy differences of the transitions connecting the native, the intermediate and the unfolded state: DeltaG(NI) (0) = 2.8 +/- 0.7 kcal mol(-1) (pH 2) and 4.2 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1) (pH 6) and DeltaG(NU) (0) = 7.2 +/- 0.6 kcal mol(-1) (pH 2) and 6.9 +/- 0.6 kcal mol(-1) (pH 6). CD unfolding data of the bovine species (BLG) have been collected here under the same experimental conditions of PLG to allow a careful comparison of the two beta-lactoglobulins. Intermediates with different characteristics have been identified for BLG and PLG, and their nature has been discussed on a structural analysis basis. The thermodynamic data reported here for PLG and BLG and the comparative analysis with data reported for equine beta lactoglobulin, show that homologous beta-barrel proteins, belonging to the same family and displaying high sequence identity (52-64%) populate unfolding intermediates to different extents, even though a common tendency to the formation of non-native alpha-helical intermediates, can be envisaged.

        "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy have been used to characterize the thermal stability of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) cleaved within different loops connecting the helical rods. The results are compared to those of the native protein. We show that the denaturation temperature and enthalpy of BR cleaved at peptide bond 71-72 or 155-156 are lower than those of the intact protein, and that these values become even lower for the BR cleaved at both peptide bonds. The effect of cleavage on the denaturation temperature and enthalpy values seems to be additive as has been previously suggested [Khan, T. W., Sturtevant, J. M., & Engelman, D. M. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 8829]. The thermal denaturation of all the samples was irreversible and scan-rate dependent. When cleaved at the 71-72 bond BR follows quantitatively the predictions of the two-state kinetic model at pH 9.5, with an activation energy of 374 kJ/mol, similar to that of native BR. Calorimetry experiments with different populations of intact and cleaved BR provide direct evidence for some intermolecular cooperativity upon denaturation. The denatured samples maintain a large proportion of alpha helices and beta structure, a fact which seems to be related to their low denaturation enthalpy as compared to that of water-soluble, globular proteins.",

Three mutations in an alpha-helix in the protein's N-terminal region, the alanine insertion mutations S44[A] and K48[A], and the substitution A42K had previously been observed to result in unexpectedly low apparent enthalpy changes of melting, compared to a pseudo-wild-type reference protein. The pseudo-wild-type reference protein thermally unfolds in an essentially two-state manner. However, we found that the unfolding of the three mutant proteins has reduced cooperativity, which partially explains their lower apparent enthalpy changes. A three-state unfolding model including a discrete intermediate is necessary to describe the melting of the mutant proteins. The reduction in cooperativity must be considered for accurate calculation of the energy changes of folding. Unfolding in two stages reflects the underlying two-subdomain structure of the lysozyme protein family.",

        "abstract": "The thermal stability of a recombinant alpha-amylase from Bacillus halmapalus alpha-amylase (BHA) has been investigated using circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This alpha-amylase is homologous to other Bacillus alpha-amylases where crystallographic studies have identified the existence of three calcium binding sites in the structure. Denaturation of BHA is irreversible with a T(m) of approximately 89 degrees C and DSC thermograms can be described using a one-step irreversible model. A 5 degrees C increase in T(m) in the presence of 10-fold excess CaCl(2) was observed. However, a concomitant increase in the tendency to aggregate was also observed. The presence of 30-40-fold excess calcium chelator (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or ethylene glycol-bis[beta-aminoethyl ether] N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)) results in a large destabilization of BHA, corresponding to about 40 degrees C lower T(m) as determined by both CD and DSC. Ten-fold excess EGTA reveals complex DSC thermograms corresponding to both reversible and irreversible transitions, which probably originate from different populations of BHA/calcium complexes. Combined interpretation of these observations and structural information on homologous alpha-amylases forms the basis for a suggested mechanism underlying the inactivation mechanism of BHA. The mechanism includes irreversible thermal denaturation of different BHA/calcium complexes and the calcium binding equilibria. Furthermore, the model accounts for a temperature-induced reversible structural change associated with calcium binding.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding kinetics of bovine trypsinogen were studied by a fluorescence-detected stopped-flow technique at pH 5.8. Trypsinogen unfolding appeared to be a rather complex reaction. Two phases, fast (with a time constant in the millisecond range) and slow, were detected in the range 2-7 M guanidium chloride (GdmCl). The natural logarithm of the rate constant of the slow phase exhibited strong dependence on [GdmCl], changing from hundreds of seconds at low denaturant concentration to about 20 ms at 7 M GdmCl. The curvature of this dependence further suggests a complex mechanism of unfolding. Generally, similar kinetics were observed for the trypsinogen.Ca complex. Small differences could be noticed, however, for the fast phase. In agreement, Ca2+ influenced only this stage of the reaction. Analysis of the dependence of the time constant of the fast phase on [CaCl2] indicates that at 4 M GdmCl, trypsinogen.Ca unfolds about sixfold slower than free zymogen, and that native trypsinogen at 4 M GdmCl still exhibits high affinity for Ca2+. Limited data on trypsin unfolding show virtually an identical dependence of the slow phase on [GdmCl]; the fast phase, however was not observed. Moreover, in the 3-4.5 M GdmCl range, a separate phase was detected. It is postulated that this phase is a manifestation of the activation-domain unfolding. The Eyring plots for the fast phase of . trypsinogen and trypsinogen.Ca unfolding are linear, indicating little change in heat capacity for this stage of reaction. The slow step of unfolding, however, shows significant curvature which indicates a substantial increase in heat capacity.",

From analyses of their thermal stabilities using differential scanning calorimetry, most of them were more destabilized than the native lysozyme, except for the G102A mutant, which has a stability similar to that of the native lysozyme at pH 2.7. As for the destabilized mutant lysozymes, their X-ray crystallographic analyses showed that their global structures did not change but that the local structures changed slightly. By examining the dihedral angles at the mutation sites based on X-ray crystallographic results, it was found that the dihedral angles at these mutation sites tended to adopt favorable values in a Ramachandran plot and that the extent and direction of their shifts from the original value had similar tendencies. Therefore, the change in dihedral angles may be the cause of the slight local structural changes around the mutation site. On the other hand, regarding the mutation of G102A, the global structure was almost identical with that of the native structure but the local structure was drastically changed. Therefore, it was suggested that the drastic local conformational change might be effective in releasing the unfavorable interaction of the native state at the mutation site.",

        "abstract": "The unfolded state of a protein is an ensemble of a large number of conformations ranging from fully extended to compact structures. To investigate the effects of the difference in the unfolded-state ensemble on protein folding, we have studied the structure, stability, and folding of \"circular\" dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherichia coli in which the N and C-terminal regions are cross-linked by a disulfide bond, and compared the results with those of disulfide-reduced \"linear\" DHFR. Equilibrium studies by circular dichroism, difference absorption spectra, solution X-ray scattering, and size-exclusion chromatography show that whereas the native structures of both proteins are essentially the same, the unfolded state of circular DHFR adopts more compact conformations than the unfolded state of the linear form, even with the absence of secondary structure. Circular DHFR is more stable than linear DHFR, which may be due to the decrease in the conformational entropy of the unfolded state as a result of circularization. Kinetic refolding measurements by stopped-flow circular dichroism and fluorescence show that under the native conditions both proteins accumulate a burst-phase intermediate having the same structures and both fold by the same complex folding mechanism with the same folding rates. Thus, the effects of the difference in the unfolded state of circular and linear DHFRs on the refolding reaction are not observed after the formation of the intermediate. This suggests that for the proteins with close termini in the native structure, early compaction of a protein molecule to form a specific folding intermediate with the N and C-terminal regions in close proximity is a crucial event in folding. If there is an enhancement in the folding reflecting the reduction in the breadth of the unfolded-state ensemble for circular DHFR, this acceleration must occur in the sub-millisecond time-range.",

        "abstract": "Thermostability is an important property of industrially significant hydrolytic enzymes: understanding the structural basis for this attribute will underpin the future biotechnological exploitation of these biocatalysts. The Cellvibrio family 10 (GH10) xylanases display considerable sequence identity but exhibit significant differences in thermostability; thus, these enzymes represent excellent models to examine the structural basis for the variation in stability displayed by these glycoside hydrolases. Here, we have subjected the intracellular Cellvibrio mixtus xylanase CmXyn10B to forced protein evolution. Error-prone PCR and selection identified a double mutant, A334V/G348D, which confers an increase in thermostability. The mutant has a Tm 8 degrees C higher than the wild-type enzyme and, at 55 degrees C, the first-order rate constant for thermal inactivation of A334V/G348D is 4.1 x 10(-4) min(-1), compared to a value of 1.6 x 10(-1) min(-1) for the wild-type enzyme. The introduction of the N to C-terminal disulphide bridge into A334V/G348D, which increases the thermostability of wild-type CmXyn10B, conferred a further approximately 2 degrees C increase in the Tm of the double mutant. The crystal structure of A334V/G348D showed that the introduction of Val334 fills a cavity within the hydrophobic core of the xylanase, increasing the number of van der Waals interactions with the surrounding aromatic residues, while O(delta1) of Asp348 makes an additional hydrogen bond with the amide of Gly344 and O(delta2) interacts with the arabinofuranose side-chain of the xylose moiety at the -2 subsite. To investigate the importance of xylan decorations in productive substrate binding, the activity of wild-type CmXyn10B, the mutant A334V/G348D, and several other GH10 xylanases against xylotriose and xylotriose containing an arabinofuranose side-chain (AX3) was assessed. The enzymes were more active against AX3 than xylotriose, providing evidence that the arabinose side-chain makes a generic contribution to substrate recognition by GH10 xylanases.",

        "abstract": "The large multidomain muscle protein myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) has been implicated for some time in cardiac disease while until recently little was known about its structure and function. Here we present a detailed study of the central domain C5 of the cardiac isoform of MyBP-C. This domain is unusual in several aspects. Firstly it contains two sizeable insertions compared to the non-cardiac isoforms. The first insertion comprises the linker between domains cC4 and cC5 that is elongated by ten amino acid residues, the second insertion comprises an elongation of the CD-loop in the middle of the domain by approximately 30 amino acid residues. Secondly two point mutations linked to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) have been identified in this domain. This work shows that the general fold of cC5 is in agreement with the IgI family of beta-sandwich structures. The long cardiac-specific linker between cC4 and cC5 is not a linker at all but an integral part of the fold of cC5, as evidenced by an unfolded mutant in which this segment was removed. The second insertion is shown to be unstructured, highly dynamic and mostly extended according to NMR relaxation measurements and analytical ultracentrifugation. The loss of several key interactions conserved in the CD-loop of the IgI fold is assumed to be responsible for the low stability of cC5 compared to other IgI domains from titin and MyBP-C itself. The low thermodynamic stability of cC5 is most evident in one of the two FHC-linked mutations, N755K (Asn115 in this construct) which is mainly unfolded with a small proportion of a native-like folded species. In contrast, the second FHC-linked mutation, R654H (Arg14 in this construct) is as well folded and stable as the wild-type. This residue is located in the extended beta-bulge at the N terminus of the protein, pointing towards the surface of the CFGA' beta-sheet. This position is in agreement with recent data pointing to a function of Arg654 in an intermolecular interaction with MyBP-C domain cC8.",

        "abstract": "Spermadhesins are a family of seminal plasma proteins composed of a single CUB domain, which appear to be involved in various aspects of the fertilization process in pigs. PSP-I and PSP-II, the most abundant porcine spermadhesins, occur in seminal plasma as noncovalent heterodimers devoid of heparin-binding capability. Of note is the stability of this dimer, which is significantly affected by physiologically relevant conditions such as Zn2+ ions. Here, we show that PSP-I and PSP-II when separated appear to conserve the overall fold of the CUB domain observed in the crystal structure of the PSP-I/PSP-II heterodimer, as concluded from gel filtration, analytical ultracentrifugation, differential scanning calorimetry, and circular dichroism analyses. However, Zn2+ concentrations in the range of those found in boar seminal plasma induce the unfolding and self-association of PSP-I, apparently as a consequence of the exposure of hydrophobic core residues, whereas they have no effect on PSP-II. Remarkably, Zn2+-denatured and self-associated (but not structured monomeric) PSP-I is retained on a heparin column, resembling the behavior of free PSP-I and homologous spermadhesins of the heparin-binding fraction of boar seminal plasma, which also exhibit different aggregation states. Thus, the modulation of the structural organization and heparin-binding ability of PSP-I by Zn2+ might be a physiological phenomenon in seminal plasma.",

        "abstract": "The vast majority of our knowledge on protein stability arises from the study of simple two-state models. However, proteins displaying equilibrium intermediates under certain conditions abound and it is unclear whether the energetics of native/intermediate equilibria is well represented in current knowledge. We consider here that the overall conformational stability of three-state proteins is made of a \"relevant\" term and a \"residual\" one, corresponding to the free energy differences of the native to intermediate (N-to-I) and intermediate to denatured (I-to-D) equilibria, respectively. The N-to-I free energy difference is considered to be the relevant stability because protein-unfolding intermediates are likely devoid of biological activity. We use surface charge optimisation to first increase the overall (N-to-D) stability of a model three-state protein (apoflavodoxin) and then investigate whether the stabilisation obtained is realised into relevant or into residual stability. Most of the mutations designed from electrostatic calculations or from simple sequence conservation analysis produce large increases in the overall stability of the protein. However, in most cases, this simply leads to similarly large increases of the residual stability. Two mutations, nevertheless, show a different trend and increase the relevant stability of the protein substantially. When all the mutations are mapped onto the structure of the apoflavodoxin thermal-unfolding intermediate (obtained independently by equilibrium phi-analysis and NMR) they cluster perfectly so that the mutations increasing the relevant stability appear in the small unstructured region of the intermediate and the others in the native-like region. This illustrates the need for specific investigation of N-to-I equilibria and the structure of protein intermediates, and indicates that it is possible to rationally stabilise a protein against partial unfolding once the structure of the intermediate conformation is known, even if at low resolution.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial luciferase is a heterodimeric (alphabeta) enzyme composed of homologous subunits. When the Vibrio harveyi luxA gene is expressed in Escherichia coli, the alpha subunit accumulates to high levels. The alpha subunit has a well-defined near-UV circular dichroism spectrum and a higher intrinsic fluorescence than the heterodimer, demonstrating fluorescence quenching in the enzyme which is reduced in the free subunit [Sinclair, J. F., Waddle, J. J., Waddill, W. F., and Baldwin, T. O. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5036-5044]. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the alpha subunit has revealed a reversible monomer to dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of 14.9 +/- 4.0 microM at 18 degrees C in 50 mM phosphate and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. The alpha subunit unfolded and refolded reversibly in urea-containing buffers by a three-state mechanism. The first transition occurred over the range of 0-2 M urea with an associated free-energy change of 2.24 +/- 0.25 kcal/mol at 18 degrees C in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The second, occurring between 2.5 and 3.5 M urea, comprised a cooperative transition with a free-energy change of 6.50 +/- 0.75 kcal/mol. The intermediate species, populated maximally at ca. 2 M urea, has defined near-UV circular dichroism spectral properties distinct from either the native or the denatured states. The intrinsic fluorescence of the intermediate suggested that, although the quantum yield had decreased, the tryptophanyl residues remained largely buried. The far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of the intermediate indicated that it had lost ca. 40% of its native secondary structure. N-Terminal sequencing of the products of limited proteolysis of the intermediate showed that the C-terminal region of the alpha subunit became protease labile over the urea concentration range at which the intermediate was maximally populated. These observations have led us to propose an unfolding model in which the first transition is the unfolding of a C-terminal subdomain and the second transition represents the unfolding of a more stable N-terminal subdomain. Comparison of the structural properties of the unfolding intermediate using spectroscopic probes and limited proteolysis of the alpha subunit with those of the alphabeta heterodimer suggested that the unfolding pathway of the alpha subunit is the same, whether it is in the form of the free subunit or in the heterodimer.",

We show that the proteins all behave in a two-state manner, with different kinetic properties. The folding rate varies remarkably between different members, with a 5000-fold variation in folding rate and 3000-fold variation in unfolding rate seen for proteins differing only 1 kcal mol(-1) in stability.

Here, portions of the cores found in three thermophilic homologues were transplanted into the core of staphylococcal nuclease, a protein of modest stability. Packing of the core was evaluated by comparing interaction energy of the three mutants to the comprehensive mutant library built up previously at these same sites in staphylococcal nuclease. It was found that the interaction energy of one thermophilic sequence is extraordinarily favorable and the interaction energies of other two transplanted thermophilic sequences are good, comparable to the interaction energies of mutant cores based on cores found in mesophilic homologues. As expected when transferring just a portion of the core sequence, the mutant proteins were destabilized overall relative to wild-type staphylococcal nuclease. The overall conclusion is that improvement of packing interactions is a mechanism to confer stability employed in some proteins from thermophiles, but not all.",

        "abstract": "Protein intermediates in equilibrium with native states may play important roles in protein dynamics but, in cases, can initiate harmful aggregation events. Investigating equilibrium protein intermediates is thus important for understanding protein behaviour (useful or pernicious) but it is hampered by difficulties in gathering structural information. We show here that the phi-analysis techniques developed to investigate transition states of protein folding can be extended to determine low-resolution three-dimensional structures of protein equilibrium intermediates. The analysis proposed is based solely on equilibrium data and is illustrated by determination of the structure of the apoflavodoxin thermal unfolding intermediate. In this conformation, a large part of the protein remains close to natively folded, but a 40 residue region is clearly unfolded. This structure is fully consistent with the NMR data gathered on an apoflavodoxin mutant designed specifically to stabilise the intermediate. The structure shows that the folded region of the intermediate is much larger than the proton slow-exchange core at 25 degrees C. It also reveals that the unfolded region is made of elements whose packing surface is more polar than average. In addition, it constitutes a useful guide to rationally stabilise the native state relative to the intermediate state, a far from trivial task.",

Using manual mixing and stopped-flow techniques, we combined different probes, including tryptophan fluorescence, chromophore fluorescence and reactivity with DTNB, to trace the spontaneous and TF-assisted folding of guanidine denatured GFPuv. We found that both unfolding and refolding of GFPuv occurred in a stepwise manner and a stable intermediate was populated under equilibrium conditions. The thermodynamic parameters obtained show that the intermediate state of GFPuv is quite compact compared to the denatured state and most of the green fluorescence is retained in this state. By studying GFPuv folding assisted by TF and a number of TF mutants, we found that wild-type TF catalyzes proline isomerization and accelerates the folding rate at low TF concentrations, but retards GFPuv folding and decelerates the folding rate at high TF concentrations. This reflects the two activities of TF, as an enzyme and as a chaperone. A general mechanism of TF assisted protein folding is discussed.",

The insulin hexamer exists in equilibrium between the forms T6, T3R3, and R6. Phenolic ligands induce and stabilize the T3R3- and R6-states which are further stabilized by binding of certain anions that do not stabilize the T6-state. It was shown that the thermostability of the resorcinol-stabilized R6-state was significantly higher than that of the T6-state. Further analysis showed that phenol- and m-cresol-stabilized R6-hexamer loses three ligands before reaching the unfolding temperature and hence unfolds from the T3R3-state. The relative affinity of the four tested anionic ligands was found, by DSC, to be thiocyanate > or = 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzoate > p-aminobenzoate > chloride. The results correlate with other methods and demonstrate that DSC provides a general and useful method of evaluation of both phenolic and anionic ligand binding to insulin without the use of probes or other alterations of the system of interest. However, it is a prerequisite that the binding is strong enough to saturate the binding sites at temperatures around the unfolding transition.",

        "abstract": "Fibronectin, a large multidomain glycoprotein, binds denatured collagen (gelatin) and mediates cell attachment and spreading on collagen-coated surfaces. Despite the high affinity, binding to gelatin is disrupted by relatively mild conditions. We have examined the effects of denaturants on the structure and function of a 42-kDa gelatin-binding fragment (GBF) isolated from chymotryptic and thermolytic digests of the parent protein. Application of linear gradients to GBF-loaded gelatin-agarose columns resulted in peak elution of the fragment at pH 5.2 or 10.2, at 0.4 M dimethylformamide, 0.9 M GdmCl, or 2.0 M urea, conditions far short of those required to induce structural changes detectable by fluorescence or circular dichroism. Solvent perturbation, fluorescence quenching, and chemical modification experiments indicate that about half of the 8 tryptophans, one-third of the 21 tyrosines, and all of the 9 lysine residues are solvent-exposed in the native protein and that 1 or more of the latter are directly involved in binding to gelatin, most likely through a hydrogen-bonding mechanism. Titration with GdmCl produced a single unfolding transition centered near 2.5 M GdmCl as monitored by changes in fluorescence and circular dichroism. This transition was fully reversible with complete recovery of structural parameters and gelatin binding. Treatment with disulfide reducing agents caused rapid irreversible changes in structure similar to those produced by GdmCl with concomitant loss of gelatin binding. Thus, tertiary and secondary structures are important for binding, but binding can be disrupted without perturbing those structures.",

Further, there is a strong correlation between the stability and the cooperativity of unfolding. Each mutation proved to be more stable in its calcium form compared to its apo form. The calcium-bound L3S substitution proved to be significantly more stable than calcium-saturated S100B, whereas the L3A, I11A, and L3A/I11A mutants are only slightly more stable than the wild-type protein.

Porin incubated at pH 12.5 and above undergoes a slow unfolding into an unordered structure. The unfolded protein could be refolded into a nativelike structure that is functionally active but with distinct deviation from the native protein. This nativelike structure exhibited an entirely different thermal stability. Although aggregation is normally considered a structural \"dead-end\", the possibility of opening an aggregated porin and forming a functionally active structure was analyzed here. Porin aggregates on heating above 86.2 degrees C. Incubating the heat-aggregated protein at high pH (> or = 12.5) leads to a slow opening of the protein into an unordered structure. It was possible to refold this unordered protein into a trimeric nativelike structure which was capable of forming active pores. However, the thermal stability of the refolded porin was unlike that of the native porin. To understand the basic mechanism behind the unfolding processes, the protein was subjected to heating at various pH values. It was observed that at pH > or = 12.5 the protein does not aggregate upon heating; instead, it opens into an unordered structure. We conclude that at high pH values, the electrostatic interactions of various amino acid residues are perturbed which leads to unfolding into an unordered structure. This study shows for the first time an entirely new unfolding and refolding pathway for porin.",

Circular dichroism spectra reveal that in water the two proteins have a very similar beta-sheet secondary structure. In the presence of 2-propanol/water mixtures (up to 50% v/v) the alpha-helix structure of both proteins increases. A further increase in the alcohol percentage of the solvent (up to 80% v/v 2-propanol) causes the formation of a new folded tertiary structure containing mainly beta-sheet features.

Its radius of gyration value (Rg), 25.1+/-0.4 A, is greater than that of beta-LgA (21.1+/-0.3 A), probably because of the contribution of polysaccharides bound to Asn-28 and Asn-63 residues of GdA.

All of these mutant proteins, except for A52W, A52R, and A52G/V74A, were overproduced and purified. Measurement of the thermal denaturations of the proteins at pH 3.2 by CD suggests that the cavity is large enough to accommodate three methyl or methylene groups without creating serious strains. A correlation was observed between the protein stability and the hydrophobicity of the substituted residue. As a result, a number of the mutant proteins were more stable than the wild-type protein. The stabilities of the mutant proteins with charged or extremely bulky residues at the cavity were lower than those expected from the hydrophobicities of the substituted residues, suggesting that considerable strains are created at the mutation sites in these mutant proteins. However, examination of the far- and near-UV CD spectra and the enzymatic activities suggest that all of the mutant proteins have structures similar to that of the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the cavity in the hydrophobic core of E. coli RNase HI is conformationally fairly stable. This may be the reason why the cavity-filling mutations effectively increase the thermal stability of this protein.",

        "abstract": "It has been recently demonstrated that alpha-chymotrypsin (CT) can be driven toward amyloid aggregation by addition of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), at intermediate concentrations. In the present article, the process of TFE-induced CT aggregation was investigated in more detailed kinetic terms where the effects of medium conditions, such as temperature, presence of kosmotropic and chaotropic salts, pH and chemical modification of lysine residues were examined. Various techniques, including light scattering, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, were used to follow and characterize this process. The kinetics of aggregation was found to obey a second-order reaction with respect to protein concentration. The aggregation-prone A-state and aggregation-deficient TFE- or T-state of CT were found to be induced at lower TFE concentrations in the presence of salts. Use of acidic and alkaline conditions and lysine modification also promoted the formation of the T-state. Results presented suggest a role for electrostatic interactions in the aggregation process.",

        "abstract": "The thermodynamic stability and temperature induced structural changes of oxidized thioredoxin h from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), near- and far-UV circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopies. At neutral pH, the heat induced unfolding of thioredoxin h is irreversible. The irreversibly unfolded protein is unable to refold due to the formation of soluble high-order oligomers. In contrast, at acidic pH the heat induced unfolding of thioredoxin h is fully reversible and thus allows the thermodynamic stability of this protein to be characterized. Analysis of the heat induced unfolding at acidic pH using calorimetric and spectroscopic methods shows that the heat induced denaturation of thioredoxin h can be well approximated by a two-state transition. The unfolding of thioredoxin h is accompanied by a large heat capacity change [6.0 +/- 1.0 kJ/(mol.K)], suggesting that at low pH a cold denaturation should be observed at the above-freezing temperatures for this protein. All used methods (DSC, near-UV CD, far-UV CD, Trp fluorescence) do indeed show that thioredoxin h undergoes cold denaturation at pH <2.5. The cold denaturation of thioredoxin h cannot, however, be fitted to a two-state model of unfolding. Furthermore, according to the far-UV CD, thioredoxin h is fully unfolded at pH 2.0 and 0 degrees C, whereas the other three methods (near-UV CD, fluorescence, and DSC) indicate that under these conditions 20-30% of the protein molecules are still in the native state. Several alternative mechanisms explaining these results such as structural differences in the heat and cold denatured state ensembles and the two-domain structure of thioredoxin h are discussed.",

These motions are more challenging to study than simple static structures. Here, we present evidence suggesting that in the enzyme adenylate kinase large \"hinge bending\" motions closely related to catalysis are regulated by intrinsic properties of the moving domains and not by their hinges, by anchoring domains, or by remote allosteric-like regions. From a pair of highly homologous mesophilic and thermophilic adenylate kinases, we generated a series of chimeric enzymes using a previously undescribed method with synthetic genes. Subsequent analysis of the chimeras has revealed unexpected spatial separation of stability and activity control. Our results highlight specific contributions of dynamics to catalysis in adenylate kinase. Furthermore, the overall strategy and the specific mutagenesis method used in this study can be generally applied.",

The free energy change of unfolding in water delta delta Gnd H2O, was evaluated assuming a three state denaturation, since the denaturation curves of three proteins suggested the presence of one stable intermediate. The values of delta Gnd H2O for the trpA33, the wild-type, and the trpA11 proteins at 25.8 degrees C and pH 7.0 were 13.4,8.8, and 6.3 kcal/mol, respectively.

We replaced Ser71 in Mc b5 with Leu, with the prediction that it would retard heme loss by diminishing polypeptide expansion accompanying rupture of the histidine to iron bonds. The strategy was partially successful in that it slowed dissociation of heme from its less stable orientation in bMc b5 (B). Heme dissociation from orientation A was accelerated to a similar extent, however, apparently owing to increased binding pocket dynamic mobility related to steric strain. A second mutation (L32I) guided by results of previous comparative studies of Mc and OM b5s diminished the steric strain, but much greater relief was achieved by replacing heme with iron deuteroporphyrin IX (FeDPIX). Indeed, the stability of the Mc(S71L) b5 FeDPIX complex is similar to that of the FeDPIX complex of OM b5. The results suggest that maximizing heme binding pocket compactness in the apo state is a useful general strategy for increasing the stability of engineered or designed proteins.",

        "abstract": "Proteins from (hyper-)thermophiles are known to exhibit high intrinsic stabilities. Commonly, their thermodynamic characterization is impeded by irreversible side reactions of the thermal analysis or calorimetrical problems. Small single-domain proteins are suitable candidates to overcome these obstacles. Here, the thermodynamics of the thermal denaturation of the recombinant cold-shock protein (Csp) from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (Tm) was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The unfolding transition can be described over a broad pH range (3.5-8.5) by a reversible two-state process. Maximum stability (DeltaG (25 degrees C)=6.5 kcal/mol) was observed at pH 5-6 where Tm Csp unfolds with a melting temperature at 95 degrees C. The heat capacity difference between the native and the denatured states is 1.1(+/-0.1) kcal/(mol K). At pH 7, thermal denaturation occurs at 82 degrees C. The corresponding free energy profile has its maximum at 30 degrees C with DeltaGN-->U=4.8(+/-0.5) kcal/mol. At the optimal growth temperature of T. maritima (80 degrees C), Tm Csp in the absence of ligands is only marginally stable, with a free energy of stabilization not far beyond the thermal energy. With the known stabilizing effect of nucleic acids in mind, this suggests a highly dynamical interaction of Tm Csp with its target molecules.",

        "abstract": "Thermal unfolding parameters were determined for a two-domain tetrameric enzyme, phosphorylating D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and for its isolated NAD(+)-binding domain. At pH 8.0, the transition temperatures (t(max)) for the apoforms of the native Bacillus stearothermophilus GAPDH and the isolated domain were 78.3 degrees C and 61.9 degrees C, with calorimetric enthalpies (DeltaH(cal)) of 4415 and 437 kJ/mol (or 30.7 and 22.1 J/g), respectively. In the presence of nearly saturating NAD(+) concentrations, the t(max) and the DeltaH(cal) increased by 13.6 degrees C and by 2365 kJ/mol, respectively, for the native apoenzyme, and by 2.8 degrees C and 109 kJ/mol for the isolated domain. These results indicate that interdomain interactions are essential for NAD(+) to produce its stabilizing effect on the structure of the native enzyme. The thermal stability of the isolated NAD(+)-binding domain increased considerably upon transition from pH 6.0 to 8.0. By contrast, native GAPDH exhibited greater stability at pH 6.0; similar pH-dependencies of thermal stability were displayed by GAPDHs isolated from rabbit muscle and Escherichia coli. The binding of NAD(+) to rabbit muscle apoenzyme increased t(max) and DeltaH(cal) and diminished the widths of the DSC curves; the effect was found to grow progressively with increasing coenzyme concentrations. Alkylation of the essential Cys149 with iodoacetamide destabilized the apoenzyme and altered the effect of NAD(+). Replacement of Cys149 by Ser or by Ala in the B. stearothermophilus GAPDH produced some stabilization, the effect of added NAD(+) being basically similar to that observed with the wild-type enzyme. These data indicate that neither the ion pairing between Cys149 and His176 nor the charge transfer interaction between Cys149 and NAD(+) make any significant contribution to the stabilization of the enzyme's native tertiary structure and the accomplishment of NAD(+)-induced conformational changes. The H176N mutant exhibited dramatically lower heat stability, as reflected in the values of both DeltaH(cal) and t(max). Interestingly, NAD(+) binding resulted in much wider heat capacity curves, suggesting diminished cooperativity of the unfolding transition.",

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding of monomeric Acanthamoeba myosin II and rabbit skeletal muscle myosin at pH 7.5 in 0.6 M KCl has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism. A single endotherm (at approximately 40 to 45 degrees C) with a maximum at 41.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C and delta H approximately 1080 +/- kcal/mol is observed for both dephospho- and phospho-myosin II. Skeletal muscle myosin unfolds with less cooperativity over a wider temperature range (approximately 40 to 60 degrees C) with delta H approximately 2500 kcal/mol. The thermal unfolding of either myosin results in a loss of approximately 70% of alpha-helical structures. Saturation of dephospho- or phospho-myosin II with 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) in the presence of Mg2+ produces a second endotherm with a maximum at approximately 49 degrees C. The latter observation is attributed to a stabilization of head regions by nucleotide binding. Indeed, a purified N-terminal myosin II head fragment has been found to unfold with Tmax approximately 41 and approximately 48 degrees C in the absence and presence of AMPPNP, respectively. The stabilization of the head regions is less with ADP+Pi and still smaller with ADP alone. In summary, thermally induced unfolding of myosin II is affected by nucleotide binding to heads, but not by phosphorylation or even removal of a 66-amino-acid tailpiece containing phosphorylation sites. The observed differences in the cooperativity of unfolding myosin II and skeletal muscle myosin relate to differences between rod structures and possibly also head-rod interactions.",

        "abstract": "The role of an 18-residue ion-pair network, that is present in the glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus, in conferring stability to other, less stable homologous enzymes, has been studied by introducing four new charged amino acid residues into the subunit interface of glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima. These two GDHs are 55 % identical in amino acid sequence, differ greatly in thermo-activity and stability and derive from microbes with different phylogenetic positions. Amino acid substitutions were introduced as single mutations as well as in several combinations. Elucidation of the crystal structure of the quadruple mutant S128R/T158E/N117R/S160E T. maritima glutamate dehydrogenase showed that all anticipated ion-pairs are formed and that a 16-residue ion-pair network is present. Enlargement of existing networks by single amino acid substitutions unexpectedly resulted in a decrease in resistance towards thermal inactivation and thermal denaturation. However, combination of destabilizing single mutations in most cases restored stability, indicating the need for balanced charges at subunit interfaces and high cooperativity between the different members of the network. Combination of the three destabilizing mutations in triple mutant S128R/T158E/N117R resulted in an enzyme with a 30 minutes longer half-life of inactivation at 85 degrees C, a 3 degrees C higher temperature optimum for catalysis, and a 0.5 degrees C higher apparent melting temperature than that of wild-type glutamate dehydrogenase. These findings confirm the hypothesis that large ion-pair networks do indeed stabilize enzymes from hyperthermophilic organisms.",

These mutants are highly destabilized relative to wild type (WT). The differences between WT and mutants in the free energy change associated with cooperative folding/unfolding, delta delta G0 (WT-->mut), have been measured by calorimetry, and they are in good agreement with delta delta G0(WT-->mut) values from hydrogen exchange rates. For F22A the change in free energy difference is about 1.7 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C; for the other three mutants it is in the range of 5-7 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C. The experimental delta delta G0(WT-->mut) values of F22A, Y23A, and F45A are reasonably well accounted for as the sum of two terms: the difference in transfer free energy change, and a contribution from exposure to solvent of new surface (Eriksson, A.E., et al., 1992, Science 255, 178-183), if the recently corrected transfer free energies and surface hydrophobicities (De Young, L. & Dill, K., 1990, J.

The thermal denaturation of wild-type staphylococcal nuclease was followed by tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism signal at 222 nm, forty-two and fourteen times, respectively. Analysis of this data using a simple two state model gave melting temperatures of 53.0+/-0.4 degrees C (fluorescence) and 52.7+/-0.6 degrees C (CD) and van't Hoff enthalpies of 82.4+/-2.6 kcal/mol and 88.6+/-4.2 kcal/mol. Ninety-seven mutants also had these parameters determined by both fluorescence and CD. The average difference between the melting temperatures was 1.05+/-0.75 degrees and the average difference between van't Hoff enthalpies was 1.6+/-4.8 kcal/mol. These very similar results for the two spectroscopic probes of structure are discussed in the context of the different models that have been proposed for nuclease denaturation. It is concluded, for most nuclease variants, that the errors introduced by a two state assumption are negligible and either virtually all helical structure is lost in any initial unfolding event or any intermediate must have low stability.",

To examine the extent to which non-local factors influence the formation of secondary structural elements, we have designed an 11-amino-acid sequence (dubbed the 'chameleon' sequence) that folds as an alpha-helix when in one position but as a beta-sheet when in another position of the primary sequence of the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). Both proteins, chameleon-alpha and chameleon-beta, are folded into structures similar to native GB1, as judged by several biophysical criteria.

        "abstract": "The truncated forms of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and -2 (delta TIMP-1 and -2), comprising the N-terminal active domain, are ideal molecules for structural analysis by intrinsic fluorescence as each contains a single conserved tryptophan residue. In this paper we describe studies on their conformational stability, unfolding/refolding kinetics and the environment of the unique tryptophan as judged by its fluorescence properties in the native state and exposure to an external quencher, acrylamide. Two forms of delta TIMP-2 were studied: delta TIMP-2 T21 derived from the full-length cDNA clone isolated from a mixed-tumour library, and delta TIMP-2 A21 containing the highly conserved V18IRAK22 sequence. In all three delta TIMP proteins the tryptophan environments in the native state appeared to be similar, but substantial differences were seen in their conformational stabilities and refolding kinetics. delta TIMP-1 was approximately twice as stable as delta TIMP-2 T21 and 1.4-fold more stable than delta TIMP-2 A21. This stability difference between delta TIMP-1 and delta TIMP-2 was shown to be independent of N-linked glycosylation. delta TIMP-1 and delta TIMP-2 A21 both showed simple two-state refolding kinetics, whereas delta TIMP-2 T21 refolding was more complex and biphasic in character. These differences between delta TIMP-2 T21 and A21 suggest that residue 21 is a structurally important site in the TIMP protein. All three truncated molecules can be considered as stable independent folding domains ideally suited for further structural analysis.",

        "abstract": "A de novo protein design has been made to understand the unique packing of natural proteins that have a beta/alpha-barrel fold. A carefully designed 207 amino acid sequence was synthesized using an Escherichia coli expression system and the structural and thermodynamic characteristics of the purified protein were studied. At neutral pH the protein is soluble and monomeric, with large amounts of secondary structure and a hydrophobic core, although the broad resonance peaks of its NMR spectrum suggest that the designed protein does not have a unique structure with tightly packed side chains. In an H-D exchange experiment, no amido protons of the designed protein exchanged slowly with deuterons. At acidic pH, thermal unfolding was observed with a remarkable change in the excess heat capacity measured directly by a differential scanning microcalorimeter. The enthalpy and entropy differences at 110 degrees C, extrapolated from analyzed thermodynamic parameters, are approximately 1/3 of the common values for natural proteins. These measurements indicate that the folding is significantly cooperative as expected, but that the protein is still loosely packed.",

        "abstract": "Homology modelling has been used to model stefin A based on the X-ray structure of stefin B. Several models have been produced by interactive modelling or positioning of the side chains by Monte Carlo procedure with simulated annealing. The quality of models was evaluated by calculation of the free energy of hydration, 3D-1D potential or buried area of surface accessibility. Stefin A is a thermostable protein, exhibiting a two-state denaturation, while stefin B denatures at a 40 degrees C lower temperature and forms a stable molten globule intermediate under mild denaturing conditions. From the tertiary structures, thermodynamic functions were predicted, conforming closely to the experimental calorimetric results. Polar and apolar buried areas of surface accessibility were obtained by structural deconvolution of the thermograms. It is suggested that the basic difference between the stefins is the domination of hydrophobic interaction in the stabilization of stefin B, which is due to its non-specific nature leading to the formation of a molten globule intermediate. Modelling of stefin A predicts increased numbers of hydrogen bonds which stabilize it and increase the cooperativity of its denaturation.",

        "abstract": "The hydrogen exchange kinetics of 68 individual amide protons in the native state of hen lysozyme have been measured at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C by 2D NMR methods. These constitute the most protected subset of amides, with exchange half lives some 10(5)-10(7) times longer than anticipated from studies of small model peptides. The observed distribution of rates under these conditions can be rationalized to a large extent in terms of the hydrogen bonding of individual amides and their burial from bulk solvent. Exchange rates have also been measured in a reversibly denatured state of lysozyme; this was made possible under very mild conditions, pH 2.0 35 degrees C, by lowering the stability of the native state through selective cleavage of the Cys-6-Cys-127 disulfide cross-link (CM6-127 lysozyme). In this state the exchange rates for the majority of amides approach, within a factor of 5, the values anticipated from small model peptides. For a few amides, however, there is evidence for significant retardation (up to nearly 20-fold) relative to the predicted rates. The pattern of protection observed under these conditions does not reflect the behavior of the protein under strongly native conditions, suggesting that regions of native-like structure do not persist significantly in the denatured state of CM6-127 lysozyme. The pattern of exchange rates from the native protein at high temperature, pH 3.8 69 degrees C, resembles that of the acid-denatured state, suggesting that under these conditions the exchange kinetics are dominated by transient global unfolding. The rates of folding and unfolding under these conditions were determined independently by magnetization transfer NMR methods, enabling the intrinsic exchange rates from the denatured state to be deduced on the basis of this model, under conditions where the predominant equilibrium species is the native state. Again, in the case of most amides these rates showed only limited deviation from those predicted by a simple random coil model. This reinforces the view that these denatured states of lysozyme have little persistent residual order and contrasts with the behavior found for compact partially folded states of proteins, including an intermediate detected transiently during the refolding of hen lysozyme.",

        "abstract": "The small globular protein, ubiquitin, contains a pair of oppositely charged residues, K11 and E34, that according to the three-dimensional structure are located on the surface of this protein with a spatial orientation characteristic of a salt bridge. We investigated the strength of this salt bridge and its contribution to the global stability of the ubiquitin molecule. Using the \"double mutant cycle\" analysis, the strength of the pairwise interactions between K11 and E34 was estimated to be favorable by 3.6kJ/mol. Further, the salt bridge of the reverse orientation, i.e. E11/K34, can be formed and is found to have a strength (3.8kJ/mol) similar to that of the K11/E34 pair. However, the global stability of the K11/E34 variant of ubiquitin is 2.2kJ/mol higher than that of the E11/K34 variant. The difference in the contribution of the opposing salt bridge orientations to the overall stability of the ubiquitin molecule is attributed to the difference in the charge-charge interactions between residues forming the salt bridge and the rest of the ionizable groups in this protein. On the basis of these results, we concluded that surface salt bridges are stabilizing, but their contribution to the overall protein stability is strongly context-dependent, with charge-charge interactions being the largest determinant. Analysis of 16 salt bridges from six different proteins, for which detailed experimental data on energetics have been reported, support the conclusions made from the analysis of the salt bridge in ubiquitin. Implications of these findings for engineering proteins with enhanced thermostability are discussed.",

        "abstract": "An experimental method is described for determining whether a covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex has the properties expected of a transition-state analog. The method involves a comparison of the noncovalent interaction energies between the enzyme and the inhibitor on one hand (determined from protein denaturation thermodynamics) and the analogous transition state on the other (determined from kinetic measurements). These two quantities should presumably be large (in comparison with the interaction energies of substrates or reaction intermediates) and close to equal for a good transition state analog; the former is seen dramatically in a large increase in protein stability. The method is absolute in the sense that it does not require a crystal structure of the inhibited enzyme or any preconceptions as to the mechanism of action of the enzyme except those which led to adoption of the potential transition state analog and which might turn out to be right or wrong. In this paper the method is quantitatively applied to the inhibition of the Staphylococcus aureus PC1 beta-lactamase by phosphonate monoesters. It is concluded that the enzyme-inhibitor complex in this case is likely to be a good transition-state mimic. Therefore, mechanistic interpretation of the crystal structure of the complex can be made with more confidence. A semiquantitative assessment of the situation with serine proteinases is also made. It is concluded, in agreement with predictions based on the generally accepted mechanism and on crystal structures, that anionic, but not neutral, phosph(or/on)yl derivatives are good transition-state analogs.",

In the presence of 0.7 M guanidine hydrochloride increased picosecond-nanosecond dynamics are observed in the protein ribonuclease A. These increased fluctuations occur throughout the protein, but the most significant increases in flexibility occur at positions believed to be the first to unfold. Addition of 0.35 M trimethylamine N-oxide to this destabilized form of ribonuclease results in significant rigidification of the protein backbone as assessed by (1)H-(15)N order parameters. Statistically, these order parameters are the same as those measured in native ribonuclease indicating that TMAO reduces the amplitude of backbone fluctuations in a destabilized protein. These data suggest that TMAO restricts the bond vector motions on the protein energy landscape to resemble those motions that occur in the native protein and points to a relation between stability and dynamics in this enzyme.",

We postulate that the stability of cutinase towards anionics can be improved by mutations increasing its temperature stability. Thermal unfolding as measured with DSC, appears to be irreversible, though the thermograms are more symmetric than predicted by a simple irreversible model. In the presence of taurodeoxycholate (TDOC), the unfolding temperature is lower and the unfolding is reversible. We conclude that an early reversible unfolding intermediate exists in which a number of additional hydrophobic patches are exposed to the solvent, or preferentially are covered with TDOC. Improvement of the stability of cutinase with respect to both surfactants and thermal denaturation, should thus be directed toward the prevention of exposure of hydrophobic patches in the early intermediate.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the ability of a protein to accommodate potentially destabilizing amino acid substitutions, and also to investigate the steric requirements for catalysis, proline was substituted at different sites within the long alpha-helix that connects the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains of T4 lysozyme. Of the four substitutions attempted, three yielded folded, functional proteins. The catalytic activities of these three mutant proteins (Q69P, D72P, and A74P) were 60-90% that of wild-type. Their melting temperatures were 7-12 degrees C less than that of wild-type at pH 6.5. Mutant D72P formed crystals isomorphous with wild-type allowing the structure to be determined at high resolution. In the crystal structure of wild-type lysozyme the interdomain alpha-helix has an overall bend angle of 8.5 degrees. In the mutant structure the introduction of the proline causes this bend angle to increase to 14 degrees and also causes a corresponding rotation of 5.5 degrees of carboxyl-terminal domain relative to the amino-terminal one. Except for the immediate location of the proline substitution there is very little change in the geometry of the interdomain alpha-helix. The results support the view that protein structures are adaptable and can compensate for potentially destabilizing amino acid substitutions. The results also suggest that the precise shape of the active site cleft of T4 lysozyme is not critical for catalysis.",

        "abstract": "Conformation and stability of the recombinant protein HIV-1 rp24 were analyzed by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry under different solvent conditions. From circular dichroism measurements, HIV-1 rp24 at pH 5.8 can be classified as an all alpha-helical protein. A fluorescence maximum of about 330 nm indicates a predominantly hydrophobic environment of the five tryptophan residues. The GdnHCl-induced unfolding curves monitored by CD and fluorescence are sigmoidal and single phasic and the midpoints of transitions are independent on the protein concentration. For the calculation of free energy of unfolding delta GuH2O a 'two-state' model was applied. The calculated values are between 18 and 24 kJ/mol and thus on the lower limit of the conformational stability of globular proteins. Melting experiments at pH 5.8 are impaired by a strong irreversible aggregation at higher temperatures. However, at pH 3.0 and in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) ocytl beta-glucopyranoside the melting curves show a large degree of reversibility with a Tm value of 38 degrees C and a molar enthalpy change delta Hm of 218 kJ/mol. At pH < 2.5 HIV-1 rp24 can adopt a new conformation which is characterized by a high alpha-helical content, a strongly decreased CD in the aromatic region, a red-shift of the fluorescence spectrum and a strong binding of ANS. These spectral features of the acid-induced conformational state are similar to those obtained for molten globule-like folding states. HIV-1 rp24 unfolds cooperatively at pH 2.0 in the concentration range of about 1.5-3.0 M GdnHCl. The calculated values delta GuH2O at pH 2.0 of about 12 kJ/mol are significantly decreased in comparison to the delta GuH2O values of the protein at pH 5.8.",

        "abstract": "Repeat proteins contain short, tandem arrays of simple structural motifs (20-40 aa). These stack together to form nonglobular structures that are stabilized by short-range interactions from residues close in primary sequence. Unlike globular proteins, they have few, if any, long-range nonlocal stabilizing interactions. One ubiquitous repeat is the tetratricopeptide motif (TPR), a 34-aa helix-turn-helix motif. In this article we describe the folding kinetics of a series of 7 designed TPR proteins that are assembled from arraying identical designed consensus repeats (CTPRan). These range from the smallest 2-repeat protein to a large 10-repeat protein (approximately 350 aa). In particular, we describe how the energy landscape changes with the addition of repeat units. The data reveal that although the CTPRa proteins have low local frustration, their highly symmetric, modular native structure is reflected in their multistate kinetics of unfolding and folding. Moreover, although the initial folding of all CTPRan proteins involves a nucleus with similar solvent accessibility, their subsequent folding to the native structure depends directly on repeat number. This corresponds to an increasingly complex landscape that culminates in CTPRa10 populating a misfolded, off-pathway intermediate. These results extend our current understanding of the malleable folding pathways of repeat proteins and highlight the consequences of adding identical repeats to the energy landscape.",

        "abstract": "Trp108 of chicken lysozyme is in van der Waals contact with Glu35, one of two catalytic carboxyl groups. The role of Trp108 in lysozyme function and stability was investigated by using mutant lysozymes secreted from yeast. By the replacement of Trp108 with less hydrophobic residues, Tyr (W108Y lysozyme) and Gln (W108Q lysozyme), the activity, saccharide binding ability, stability, and pKa of Glu35 were all decreased with a decrease in the hydrophobicity of residue 108. Namely, at pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C, the activities of W108Y and W108Q lysozymes against glycol chitin were 17.3 and 1.6% of that of wild-type lysozyme, and their dissociation constants for the binding of a trimer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine were 7.4 and 309 times larger than that of wild-type lysozyme, respectively. For the reversible unfolding at pH 3.5 and 30 degrees C, W108Y and W108Q lysozymes were less stable than wild-type lysozyme by 1.4 and 3.6 kcal/mol, respectively. As for the pKa of Glu35, the values for W108Y and W108Q lysozymes were found to be lower than that for wild-type lysozyme by 0.2 and by 0.6 pKa unit, respectively. The pKa of Glu35 in lysozyme was also decreased from 6.1 to 5.4 by the presence of 1-3 M guanidine hydrochloride, or to 5.5 by the substitution of Asn for Asp52, another catalytic carboxyl group. Thus, both the hydrophobicity of Trp108 and the electrostatic interaction with Asp52 are equally responsible for the abnormally high pKa (6.1) of Glu35, compared with that (4.4) of a normal glutamic acid residue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

To explore another approach for characterizing the molten globule state, salt-induced formation of the molten globule state of horse cytochrome c at pH 1.8 was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry. By titrating the acid-unfolded cytochrome c with sodium perchlorate, an exothermic reaction was observed. The titration curve obtained from the heat was cooperative and agreed well with the conformational transition curve measured by CD at 222 nm. This result indicated that the salt-induced conformation change is well approximated by a two-state transition between the acid-unfolded and molten globule states. The heat for formation of the molten globule state estimated by isothermal titration calorimetry was consistent with the enthalpy change for unfolding of the sodium perchlorate-stabilized molten globule state at pH 1.8, which was measured by differential scanning calorimetry and CD. These results indicate that the heat of titration largely reflects the enthalpy change of the conformational transition. From these results, we consider that isothermal titration calorimetry will become a useful approach for investigating the molten globule state.",

The correlations between the thermodynamic parameters (heat capacity increment, delta Cp,U, the proportionality factor, m, and the Gibbs energy, delta Gw298) of unfolding and some integral structural parameters, such as polar and non-polar areas exposed upon domain denaturation, have been analyzed. The experimental data on delta Cp,U and the m-factor of the linear extrapolation model (LEM) obey the simple empirical correlations deduced elsewhere. The Gibbs energies calculated from the DSC data were compared with those found by fitting urea-unfolding curves to the LEM and the denaturant-binding model (DBM). The delta Gw298 values found with DBM correlate better with the DSC data, while those obtained with LEM are systematically smaller. The systematic difference between the parameters calculated with LEM and DBM are explained by an inherent imperfection of the LEM.",

        "abstract": "The temperature-induced beta-hairpin stabilities of selected mutations of the Trpzip1 peptide, SWTWEGNKWTWK (WWWW), have been investigated by electronic circular dichroism (CD), Raman, and FT-IR spectroscopies. The tryptophan (Trp) residues in the original Trpzip1 sequence were systematically substituted with tyrosine (Tyr) in different positions to test the impact of Trp interactions on the beta-hairpin structure and stability. The CD intensity at approximately 228 nm, which arises from Trp-Trp interactions (tertiary structure), and the amide I' IR absorbance at approximately 1635 cm(-1) (secondary structure) have been measured over a range of temperatures to investigate the impact of Tyr substitution on beta-hairpin thermal stability in Trpzip peptides. Mutation from Trp to Tyr in the Trpzip1 sequence reduces the extent of beta-hairpin structure and monotonically decreases the beta-hairpin stability of Trpzip1 mutant peptides with an increasing number of Tyr substitutions. Substituted Trpzip peptides with just one pair of Trp-Trp interactions close to either the terminal residues (WYYW) or the turn (YWWY) have similar stabilities. Comparison of conformational transitions monitored by CD and IR reveals them to have multistate behavior in which the temperature-induced disruption of the Trp-Trp interaction (tertiary structure) occurs at a lower temperature than the unfolding of the secondary structure.",

        "abstract": "Acid-denatured apomyoglobin (apoMb) contains residual helical structure in the region of the polypeptide which corresponds to the H helix of the folded protein. In order to elucidate the role of this residual secondary structure in the protein folding process and to determine whether residual structure in the denatured state affects either the overall rate of folding or the rate of formation of a burst phase intermediate, we have examined the equilibrium and kinetic folding behavior of a mutant designed to destabilize residual secondary structure in the H helix region. Both Asn132 and Glu136 were changed to Gly (N132G,E136G) to effect this destabilization. Circular dichroism spectra show that the mutant protein contains less helical structure in the acid-denatured state and in the equilibrium intermediate state at pH 4.2 than does the wild-type protein. The CD spectra of the native states of the two proteins are nearly identical. The refolding kinetics for each of the species were measured by stopped-flow CD in the far-UV region and by NMR quench-flow pulse labeling. Under identical conditions, the CD-detected refolding of wild-type and mutant apomyoglobin from the acid-denatured state or from the urea-denatured state occurs at very similar rates following a burst phase that occurs too rapidly to measure by the stopped-flow technique. The urea dependence of the unfolding and refolding rates is consistent with the presence of at least one obligatory on-pathway intermediate in both wild-type and mutant proteins. The kinetic intermediate of the mutant protein is considerably less stable than that of the wild-type protein. Hydrogen exchange pulse labeling experiments indicate that, in contrast to the wild-type protein, the H helix is not stabilized during the burst phase refolding of the mutant but becomes stabilized during the slower phases. While the wild-type and mutant proteins both form compact intermediates, these differ in the content and location of secondary structure. The rate of folding of the AGH subdomain, which takes place prior to the transition state, is substantially slower for the N132G,E136G mutant protein. A strong propensity for spontaneous formation of helical structure in the H helix region is not a prerequisite for efficient folding nor for formation of equilibrium or kinetic intermediates. These observations suggest that while folding of apomyoglobin proceeds through an obligatory intermediate, the precise structure of this intermediate is not critical and its secondary structure may be altered without substantially affecting either the overall refolding kinetics or the integrity of the final folded state.",

        "abstract": "Temperature-induced changes of the states of beta-lactoglobulin have been studied calorimetrically. In the presence of a high concentration of urea this protein shows not only heat but also cold denaturation. Its heat denaturation is approximated very closely by a two-state transition, while the cold denaturation deviates considerably from the two-state transition and this deviation increases as the temperature decreases. The heat effect of cold denaturation is opposite in sign to that of heat denaturation and is noticeably larger in magnitude. This difference in magnitude is caused by the temperature-dependent negative heat effect of additional binding of urea to the polypeptide chain of the protein upon its unfolding, which decreases the positive enthalpy of heat denaturation and increases the negative enthalpy of cold denaturation. The binding of urea considerably increases the partial heat capacity of the protein, especially in the denatured state. However, when corrected for the heat capacity effect of urea binding, the partial heat capacity of the denatured protein is close in magnitude to that expected for the unfolded polypeptide chain in aqueous solution without urea but only for temperatures below 10 degrees C. At higher temperatures, the heat capacity of the denatured protein is lower than that expected for the unfolded polypeptide chain. It appears that at temperatures above 10 degrees C not all the surface of the beta-lactoglobulin polypeptide chain is exposed to the solvent, even in the presence of 6 M urea; i.e., the denatured protein is not completely unfolded and unfolds only at temperatures lower than 10 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Glu35 in chicken lysozyme has an abnormally high pKa (6.1) partly due to the hydrophobic environment provided by Trp108. The relationship between protein stability and abnormal pKa was investigated in detail by using mutant lysozymes in which Glu35 was replaced by undissociable residues and an oppositely ionizable residue. It was found that lysozyme was stabilized at alkaline pH range by the replacement of Glu35 with an undissociable residue, Gln (E35Q lysozyme) or Al (E35A lysozyme). On the other hand, when Glu35 was replaced by His (E35H lysozyme), which could have an opposite charge to Glu by ionization, the introduced His35 was found to have an abnormally low pKa (3.6), leading to the destabilization of lysozyme at acidic pH. These observations are completely consistent with the situation that the environment around Glu35 is highly hydrophobic and therefore the placement of either a positive or negative charge in such an environment leads to destabilization of lysozyme. These observations also indicate that the replacement of an acidic residue having abnormally high pKa or a basic residue having abnormally low pKa by an undissociable residue is a very efficient and general method for stabilization of a protein.",

        "abstract": "Several recent studies have shown that it is possible to increase protein stability by improving electrostatic interactions among charged groups on the surface of the folded protein. However, the stability increases are considerably smaller than predicted by a simple Coulomb's law calculation, and in some cases, a charge reversal on the surface leads to a decrease in stability when an increase was predicted. These results suggest that favorable charge-charge interactions are important in determining the denatured state ensemble, and that the free energy of the denatured state may be decreased more than that of the native state by reversing the charge of a side chain. We suggest that when the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the folded state are disrupted, the unfolded polypeptide chain rearranges to compact conformations with favorable long-range electrostatic interactions. These charge-charge interactions in the denatured state will reduce the net contribution of electrostatic interactions to protein stability and will help determine the denatured state ensemble. To support this idea, we show that the denatured state ensemble of ribonuclease Sa is considerably more compact at pH 7 where favorable charge-charge interactions are possible than at pH 3, where unfavorable electrostatic repulsion among the positive charges causes an expansion of the denatured state ensemble. Further support is provided by studies of the ionic strength dependence of the stability of charge-reversal mutants of ribonuclease Sa. These results may have important implications for the mechanism of protein folding.",

        "abstract": "For 30 years, the prevailing view has been that the hydrophobic effect contributes considerably more than hydrogen bonding to the conformational stability of globular proteins. The results and reasoning presented here suggest that hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect make comparable contributions to the conformational stability of ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1). When RNase T1 folds, 86 intramolecular hydrogen bonds with an average length of 2.95 A are formed. Twelve mutants of RNase T1 [Tyr----Phe (5), Ser----Ala (3), and Asn----Ala (4)] have been prepared that remove 17 of the hydrogen bonds with an average length of 2.93 A. On the basis of urea and thermal unfolding studies of these mutants, the average decrease in conformational stability due to hydrogen bonding is 1.3 kcal/mol per hydrogen bond. This estimate is in good agreement with results from several related systems. Thus, we estimate that hydrogen bonding contributes about 110 kcal/mol to the conformational stability of RNase T1 and that this is comparable to the contribution of the hydrophobic effect. Accepting the idea that intramolecular hydrogen bonds contribute 1.3 +/- 0.6 kcal/mol to the stability of systems in an aqueous environment makes it easier to understand the stability of the \"molten globule\" states of proteins, and the alpha-helical conformations of small peptides.",

In this variant (ml8bTIM), the phosphate binding loop had been shortened, causing the binding site to be much more extended. Here, it is reported that in the V233A variant of ml8bTIM (A-TIM), three important properties of the wild-type TIM active site have been restored: (i) the structural properties of loop-7, (ii) the binding site of a conserved water molecule between loop-7 and loop-8 and (iii) the binding site of the phosphate moiety. It is shown that the active site of A-TIM can bind TIM transition state analogs and suicide inhibitors competently. It is found that the active site geometry of the A-TIM complexes is less compact and more solvent exposed, as in wild-type TIM. This correlates with the observation that the catalytic efficiency of A-TIM for interconverting the TIM substrates is too low to be detected. It is also shown that the A-TIM active site can bind compounds which do not bind to wild-type TIM and which are completely different from the normal TIM substrate, like a citrate molecule. The binding of this citrate molecule is stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with the new binding groove.",

        "abstract": "The thermodynamics of barnase denaturation has been studied calorimetrically over a broad range of temperature and pH. It is shown that in acidic solutions the heat denaturation of barnase is well approximated by a 2-state transition. The heat denaturation of barnase proceeds with a significant increase of heat capacity, which determines the temperature dependencies of the enthalpy and entropy of its denaturation. The partial specific heat capacity of denatured barnase is very close to that expected for the completely unfolded protein. The specific denaturation enthalpy value extrapolated to 130 degrees C is also close to the value expected for the full unfolding. Therefore, the calorimetrically determined thermodynamic characteristics of barnase denaturation can be considered as characteristics of its complete unfolding and can be correlated with structural features--the number of hydrogen bonds, extent of van der Waals contacts, and the surface areas of polar and nonpolar groups. Using this information and thermodynamic information on transfer of protein groups into water, the contribution of various factors to the stabilization of the native structure of barnase has been estimated. The main contributors to the stabilization of the native state of barnase appear to be intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The contributions of van der Waals interactions between nonpolar groups and those of hydration effects of these groups are not as large if considered separately, but the combination of these 2 factors, known as hydrophobic interactions, is of the same order of magnitude as the contribution of hydrogen bonding.",

Differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence monitoring of guanidine hydrochloride unfolding and fluorescence quenching were used, among other techniques, to show that the cold-adapted enzyme is characterized by a high activity at low temperatures, a poor stability and a high flexibility. In contrast, the thermophilic enzyme is shown to have a reduced low temperature activity, high stability and a reduced flexibility. These findings agree with the hypothesis that cold-adapted enzymes overcome the quandary imposed by low temperature environments via a global or local increase in the flexibility of their molecular edifice, with this in turn leading to a reduced stability. Analysis of the guanidine hydrochloride unfolding, as well as the thermodynamic parameters of irreversible thermal unfolding and thermal inactivation shows that the driving force for this denaturation and inactivation is a large entropy change while a low enthalpy change is implicated in the low temperature activity. A reduced number of salt-bridges are believed to be responsible for both these effects. Guanidine hydrochloride unfolding studies also indicate that both family 8 enzymes unfold via an intermediate prone to aggregation.",

        "abstract": "The stability and folding kinetics of wild-type and a mutant staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) at neutral pH are significantly perturbed by the presence of moderate to high concentrations of salts. Very substantial increases in stability toward thermal and urea denaturation were observed; for example, 0.4 M sodium sulfate increased the free energy of wild-type SNase by more than 2 kcal/mol. For the NCA SNase mutant, the presence of the salts abolished the cold denaturation observed at neutral pH with this variant, and substantially increased its stability. Significant effects of salts on the kinetics of refolding were also observed. For NCA SNase, the presence of the salts markedly increased the folding rates (up to 5-fold). On the other hand, chloride, in particular, substantially decreased the rate of folding of the wild-type protein. Since the rates of the slow phases due to proline isomerization were increased by salt, these steps must be coupled to conformational processes. Fluorescence energy transfer between the lone tryptophan (Trp140) and an engineered fluorescent acceptor at residue 64 revealed that the addition of a high concentration of KCl led to the formation of a transient folding intermediate not observed at lower salt concentrations, and in which residues 140 and 64 were much closer than in the native state. The salt-induced effects on the kinetics of folding are attributed to the enhanced stability of the transient folding intermediates. It is likely that the combination of the high net charge, due to the high isoelectric point, and the relatively low intrinsic hydrophobicity, leads to staphylococcal nuclease having only marginal stability at neutral pH. The salt-induced effects on the structure, stability, and kinetics of staphylococcal nuclease are attributed to the binding of counterions, namely, anions, resulting in minimization of intramolecular electrostatic repulsion. This leads to increased stability, more structure, and greater compactness, as observed. Consequently, localized electrostatic repulsion is present at neutral pH in SNase, probably contributing to its marginal stability. The results suggest that, in general, marginally stable globular proteins will be significantly stabilized by salts under conditions where they have a substantial net charge.",

        "abstract": "The stability of tetrameric malate dehydrogenase from the green phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus (CaMDH) is at least in part determined by electrostatic interactions at the dimer-dimer interface. Since previous studies had indicated that the thermal stability of CaMDH becomes lower with increasing pH, attempts were made to increase the stability by removal of (excess) negative charge at the dimer-dimer interface. Mutation of Glu165 to Gln or Lys yielded a dramatic increase in thermal stability at pH 7.5 (+23.6 -- + 23.9 degrees C increase in apparent t(m)) and a more moderate increase at pH 4.4 (+4.6 -- + 5.4 degrees C). The drastically increased stability at neutral pH was achieved without forfeiture of catalytic performance at low temperatures. The crystal structures of the two mutants showed only minor structural changes close to the mutated residues, and indicated that the observed stability effects are solely due to subtle changes in the complex network of electrostatic interactions in the dimer-dimer interface. Both mutations reduced the concentration dependency of thermal stability, suggesting that the oligomeric structure had been reinforced. Interestingly, the two mutations had similar effects on stability, despite the charge difference between the introduced side-chains. Together with the loss of concentration dependency, this may indicate that both E165Q and E165K stabilize CaMDH to such an extent that disruption of the inter-dimer electrostatic network around residue 165 no longer limits kinetic thermal stability.",

        "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a) is the founding member of the INK4 family of tumor suppressors capable of arresting mammalian cell division. Missense mutations in the p16(INK4a) gene (INK4a/CDKN2A/MTS1) are strongly linked to several types of human cancer. These mutations are evenly distributed throughout this small, ankyrin repeat protein and the majority of them disrupt the native secondary and/or tertiary structure, leading to protein unfolding, aggregation and loss of function. We report here the use of multiple stabilizing substitutions to increase the stability of p16(INK4a) and furthermore, to restore Cdk4 binding activity of several defective, cancer-related mutant proteins. Stabilizing substitutions were predicted using four different techniques. The three most effective substitutions were combined to create a hyperstable p16(INK4a) variant that is 1.4 kcal/mol more stable than wild-type. This engineered construct is monomeric in solution with wild-type-like secondary and tertiary structure and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 binding activity. Interestingly, these hyperstable substitutions, when combined with oncogenic mutations R24P, P81L or V126D, can significantly restore Cdk4 binding activity, despite the divergent features of each destabilizing mutation. Extensive biophysical studies indicate that the hyperstable substitutions enhance the binding activity of mutant p16 through several different mechanisms, including an increased amount of secondary structure and thermostability, reduction in exposed hydrophobic surface(s) and/or a reduced tendency to aggregate. This apparent global suppressor effect suggests that increasing the thermodynamic stability of p16 can be used as a general strategy to restore the biological activity to defective mutants of this important tumor suppressor protein.",

The domain is a stable cooperative folding unit of 56 amino acids, which maintains a unique folded structure without disulfide cross-links or tight ligand binding. We have studied the thermodynamics of the unfolding reaction for the two versions of this domain, designated B1 and B2, which differ by six amino acids. They have denaturation temperatures of 87.5 degrees C and 79.4 degrees C, respectively at pH 5.4, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic state functions for the unfolding reaction (delta G, delta H, delta S, and delta Cp) have been determined and reveal several interesting insights into the behavior of very small proteins. First, though the B1 domain has a heat denaturation point close to 90 degrees C, it is not unusually stable at physiologically relevant temperatures (delta G = 25 kJ/mol at 37 degrees C). This behavior occurs because the stability profile (delta G vs temperature) is flat and shallow due to the small delta S and delta Cp for unfolding. Related to this point is the second observation that small changes in the free energy of unfolding of the B-domain due to mutation or change in solvent conditions lead to large shifts in the heat denaturation temperature. Third, the magnitude and relative contributions of hydrophobic vs nonhydrophobic forces (per amino acid residue) to the total free energy of folding of the B-domain are remarkably typical of other globular proteins of much larger size.",

We carried out protein stability measurements, X-ray crystallographic analyses, and free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulation. The equilibrium unfolding transitions induced by guanidine hydrochloride demonstrated that the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants were, respectively, 1.9 and 3.2 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type protein (WT). The overall structures of the mutants were almost identical to that of WT, in spite of the disruption of the hydrogen bonding between the side-chain O-H group of Thr29 and the main-chain C=O group of Glu25. To analyze the stabilization mechanism of the mutants, we performed free energy calculations. The calculated free energy differences were in good agreement with the experimental values. The stabilization of the mutants was mainly caused by solvation loss in the denatured state. Furthermore, the O-H group of Thr29 favorably interacts with the C=O group of Glu25 to form hydrogen bonds and, simultaneously, unfavorably interacts electrostatically with the main-chain C=O group of Thr29.

        "abstract": "The effects of stabilising mutations on the folding process of common-type acylphosphatase have been investigated. The mutations were designed to increase the helical propensity of the regions of the polypeptide chain corresponding to the two alpha-helices of the native protein. Various synthetic peptides incorporating the designed mutations were produced and their helical content estimated by circular dichroism. The most substantial increase in helical content is found for the peptide carrying five mutations in the second alpha-helix. Acylphosphatase variants containing the corresponding mutations display, to different extents, enhanced conformational stabilities as indicated by equilibrium urea denaturation experiments monitored by changes of intrinsic fluorescence. All the protein variants studied here refold with apparent two-state kinetics. Mutations in the first alpha-helix are responsible for a small increase in the refolding rate, accompanied by a marked decrease in the unfolding rate. On the other hand, multiple mutations in the second helix result in a considerable increase in the refolding rate without any significant effect on the unfolding rate. Addition of trifluoroethanol was found to accelerate the folding of the acylphosphatase variants, the extent of the acceleration being inversely proportional to the intrinsic rate of folding of the corresponding mutant. The trifluoroethanol-induced acceleration is far less marked for those variants whose alpha-helical structure is efficiently stabilised by amino acid replacements. This observation suggests that trifluoroethanol acts in a similar manner to the stabilising mutations in promoting native-like secondary structure. Analysis of the kinetic data indicates that the second helix is fully consolidated in the transition state for folding of acylphosphatase, whereas the first helix is only partially formed. These data suggest that the second helix is an important element in the folding process of the protein.",

        "abstract": "Threonine 59, a helix-capping residue at the amino terminus of the longest helix in T4 phage lysozyme, was substituted with valine, alanine, glycine, serine, asparagine, and aspartic acid. The valine, alanine, and glycine replacements were observed to be somewhat more destabilizing than serine, asparagine, and aspartic acid. The crystal structures of the different variants showed that changes in conformation occurred at the site of substitution, including Asp 61, which is nearby, as well as displacement of a solvent molecule that is hydrogen-bonded to the gamma-oxygen of Thr 59 in wild-type lysozyme. Neither the structures nor the stabilities of the mutant proteins support the hypothesis of Serrano and Fersht (1989) that glycine and alanine are better helix-capping residues than valine because a smaller-sized residue allows better hydration at the end of the helix. In the aspartic acid and asparagine replacements the substituted side chains form hydrogen bonds with the end of the helix, as does threonine and serine at this position. In contrast, however, the Asp and Asn side chains also make unusually close contacts with carbon atoms in Asp 61. This suggests a structural basis for the heretofore puzzling observations that asparagine is more frequently observed as a helix-capping residue than threonine [Richardson, J. S., & Richardson, D. C.

        "abstract": "Barnase is described anatomically in terms of its substructures and their mode of packing. The surface area of hydrophobic residues buried on formation and packing of the structural elements has been calculated. Changes in stability have been measured for 64 mutations, 41 constructed in this study, strategically located over the protein. The purpose is to provide: (1) information on the magnitudes of changes in stabilization energy for mutations of residues that are important in maintaining the structure; and (2) probes for the folding pathway to be used in subsequent studies. The majority of mutations delete functional moieties of side-chains or make isosteric changes. The energetics of the interactions are variable and context-dependent. The following general conclusions may be drawn, however, from this study about the classes of interactions that stabilize the protein. (1) Truncation of buried hydrophobic side-chains has, in general, the greatest effect on stability. For fully buried residues, this averages at 1.5 kcal mol-1 per methylene group with a standard deviation of +/- 0.6 kcal mol-1. Truncation of partly exposed leucine, isoleucine or valine residues that are in the range of 50 to 80 A2 of solvent-accessible area (30 to 50% of the total solvent-accessible area on a Gly-X-Gly tripeptide, i.e. those packed against the surface) has a smaller, but relatively constant effect on stability, at 0.81 kcal mol-1 per methylene group with a statistical standard deviation of +/- 0.18 kcal mol-1. (2) There is a very poor correlation between hydrophobic surface area buried and the free energy change for an extensive data set of hydrophobic mutants. The best correlation is found to be between the free energy change and the number of methylene groups within a 6 A radius of the hydrophobic groups deleted. (3) Burial of the hydroxyl group of threonine in a pocket that is intended for a gamma-methyl group of valine costs 2.5 kcal mol-1, in the range expected for the loss of two hydrogen bonds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Aromatic side-chains are found in the vicinity of histidine residues in many proteins and protein complexes. We have studied the interaction between a histidine residue (His18) and aromatic residues at position 94 in barnase. Three different techniques have been applied to show that Trp94 interacts more strongly with the protonated form of His18. The aromatic-histidine interaction stabilizes the protonated form of histidine by 0.8 to 1 kcal mol-1 relative to the unprotonated and, thereby, increases its pKa value. This was shown indirectly from the pH dependence of the stability of the wild-type protein and the mutant Trp94----Leu; and directly from the difference in pKa of His18 between wild-type barnase and the same mutant protein, and from double-mutant cycles that measure the total interaction energy of Trp94 with His18 at both low and high pH. When Trp94 is replaced by other aromatic amino acids, the strength of the interaction decreases in the series His-Trp greater than His-Tyr greater than His-Phe. The interaction is not masked by high salt concentrations. The raising of the pKa value of His18 by interaction with Trp94 is shown to be consistent with solution studies with model compounds. The histidine-aromatic interaction could have implications in binding and catalysis for modulation of the histidine pKa value.",

        "title": "Co-operative interactions during protein folding.", 
        "abstract": "The theory for measuring co-operativity between interactions in proteins by protein engineering experiments is developed by introducing a procedure for analysing increasing orders of synergy in a protein with increasing numbers of residues. The (pairwise) interaction energy (delta 2Gint) between two side-chains may be measured experimentally by a double-mutant cycle consisting of the wild-type protein, the two single mutants and the double mutant. This procedure may be extended to three residues to give a value for delta 3Gint for a triple-mutant cube, and to higher orders using multi-dimensional mutant space. We now show that delta 3Gint is the excess energy of adding all three chains compared with the sum of all the pairwise values of delta 2Gint for each of the constituent double-mutant cycles and the sum of all the single addition energies. This physical interpretation extends to higher orders of mutation. delta nGint (i.e. the interaction energy for n residues), thus, reveals the layers of synergy in interactions as a protein is built up. This procedure is applied to measuring changes in synergy during the refolding of barnase for the triad of salt-linked residues Asp8, Asp12 and Arg110, which are mutated to alanine residues. The value of delta 3Gint in the folded structure is 0.77(+/- 0.06) kcal mol-1 (i.e. the triad is 0.77 kcal mol-1 more stable than expected from the sum of the individual pairwise interactions and single contributions). The value of delta 3Gint is still significant in the transition state for unfolding (0.60(+/- 0.07) kcal mol-1) and in the folding intermediate (0.60(+/- 0.13 kcal mol-1)). These results show that synergistic interactions exist in barnase, in its transition state for unfolding and in a refolding intermediate. A direct measurement of the change of co-operativity between the folded state and the transition state for unfolding shows a decrease of 0.17(+/- 0.04) kcal mol-1, suggesting that the initial stages of protein unfolding may be accompanied by some loosening of structure in parts that still interact. The similar extent of co-operativity in the transition state for unfolding and the intermediate in refolding suggests that the intermediate is homogeneous, at least in the region of the salt-linked triad, as heterogeneity would lower the co-operativity.",

        "abstract": "Folding kinetics of a series of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) variants with similar stabilities and structures have been measured. All are strongly destabilized relative to WT. In Y21A, F22A, Y23A, G37A, and F45A, the three native disulfide bonds are retained. In RM(14-38), Cys14 and Cys38 thiols are methylated while C30-C51 and C5-C55 disulfides remain intact. At pH 2 and 20 degrees C, relaxation rate constants of the major kinetic phase range from approximately 10 ms to 0.71 s in the absence of denaturant. All mutants except G37A exhibit standard two-state behavior. Y21A, F22A, and Y23A fold much more slowly than other mutants. The experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that native-like structure detected in the unfolded BPTI is important in folding. Two native-like contacts are implied by NOEs in reduced and unfolded BPTI, between residues Tyr23 and Ala25, and between Gly37 NH and the Tyr35 ring. The results support an earlier hypothesis that formation of the central beta-hairpin, monitored by a local native interaction between Tyr23 and Ala25, is crucial to initiation of BPTI folding. The second native-like contact is important, not in folding initiation, but in preventing a kinetic trap later in the process. Evidence for this comes from mutant G37A, which behaves very differently from the others in displaying a phenomenon called rollover. G37A is, to our knowledge, the first reported case in which a single-site replacement causes rollover, while the wild type and all other known mutants of the same protein show typical two-state chevron plots. The best explanation is that the G37A mutation introduces a kinetic trap of the type described by Chan and Dill [(1998) Proteins 30, 2-33]. In native BPTI, there is an unusual polar interaction between the ring of Tyr35 and the backbone NH of Gly37. Our results suggest that the NH-aromatic interaction between residues 37 and 35 is important throughout folding in stabilizing native-like loop conformations and in preventing the flexible loops from being trapped in nonfunctional conformations during later stages of folding.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium circular dichroism and kinetic stopped-flow fluorescence studies on the stability and the folding kinetics of a set of Trp to Phe mutants of goat alpha-lactalbumin (GLA) were used to characterize the native, intermediate, and transition states of these constructs. GLA contains four tryptophan residues, three of which, Trp26, Trp104, and Trp118, are located in the alpha-domain, while the fourth, Trp60, is located in the beta-domain. Trp26, Trp60, and Trp104 are part of a hydrophobic cluster, whereas Trp118 is situated in a more flexible region near the C-terminal end of the protein. In each case, the mutation leads to a reduction in the overall stability, but only for W26F and W60F is an equilibrium intermediate observed in guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding experiments. In kinetic refolding experiments, however, for all samples a burst phase is observed, the amplitude of which depends on the specific mutation. Refolding and unfolding kinetics can adequately be described by a sequential three-state mechanism. phi value analysis showed that the local structure around Trp26, Trp60, and Trp104 is formed in the intermediate and in the transition state of the folding reaction, while around Trp118 no persistent native contacts are observed. From these findings, we conclude that, although hydrophobicity is a major driving force for folding, minor steric changes induced by point mutation can considerably influence the overall stability and the folding process of the protein.",

        "abstract": "The structure of the first significant transition state on the unfolding pathway of barnase has been analysed in detail by protein engineering methods. Over 50 mutations placed strategically over the whole protein have been used as probes to report on the local structure in the transition state. Several different probes for many regions of the protein give consistent results as do multiple probes at the same site. The overall consistency of phi values indicates that the mutations have not produced changes in the protein that significantly alter the transition state for unfolding. A fine-structure analysis of interactions has also been conducted by removing different parts of the same side-chains. Many of the results of simple mutations fall nicely into the two clear-cut cases of phi = 1 or 0, indicating that the local noncovalent bonds are either fully broken or fully made in the transition state. Much of the structure of barnase in the transition state for unfolding is very similar to that in the folded protein. Both major alpha-helices fray at the N terminus. The last two turns in helix1 are certainly intact, as is the C terminus of helix2. The general picture of the beta-sheet is that the three central beta-strands are completely intact while the two edge beta-strands are mainly present but certainly weakened. The first five residues of the protein unwind but the C terminus remains folded. Three of the five loops are unfolded. The edges of the main hydrophobic core (core1) are significantly weakened, however, and their breaking appears partly rate determining. The centre of the small hydrophobic core3 remains intact. Core2 is completely disrupted. The first events in unfolding are thus: the unfolding of several loops, the unwinding of the helices from the N termini, and the weakening and disruption of the hydrophobic cores. The values of phi are found to be substantially the same under conditions that favour folding as under conditions that are highly denaturing, and so the structure of the unfolding transition state is substantially the same in water as in the presence of denaturant. The structure of the final kinetically significant transition state for refolding is identical to that for unfolding. The final events in refolding are, accordingly, the consolidation of the hydrophobic cores, the closing of many loops and the capping of the N termini of the helices.",

        "abstract": "Ovalbumin is a member of a superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors, known as the serpins. It is, however, non-inhibitory towards serine proteinases, and lacks the loop insertion mechanism common to the serpins due to unknown structural factors. Mutant ovalbumin, R339T, in which the P14 hinge residue is replaced, was produced and analyzed for its thermostability and three-dimensional structure. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the mutant ovalbumin, but not the wild-type protein, undergoes a marked thermostabilization (DeltaT(m)=15.8 degrees C) following the P1-P1' cleavage. Furthermore, the crystal structure, solved at 2.3 A resolution, clearly proved that the P1-P1' cleaved form assumes the fully loop-inserted conformation as seen in serpin that possess inhibitory activity. We therefore conclude that ovalbumin acquires the structural transition mechanism into the loop-inserted, thermostabilized form by the single hinge mutation. The mutant protein does not, however, possess inhibitory activity. The solved structure displays the occurrence of specific interactions that may prevent the smooth motion, relative to sheet A, of helices E and F and of the loop that follows helix F. These observations provide crucial insights into the question why R339T is still non-inhibitory.",

We replaced ESBL serine residues 126 and 265 with cysteine to probe the conformation of buried regions in each domain. Spectroscopic, hydrodynamic, and chemical methods revealed that the mutations do not alter the native fold but distinctly change stability (S-126C > wild-type > S-126/265C > S-265C ESBL) and the features of partially folded states. The observed wild-type ESBL equilibrium intermediate has decreased fluorescence but full secondary structure. S-126C ESBL intermediate has the fluorescence of the unfolded state, no thiol reactivity, and partial secondary structure. S-265C and S-126/265C ESBL populate intermediate states unfolded by fluorescence and thiol reactivity but with full secondary structure. Mass analysis of S-126/265C ESBL in the partially folded state proved that both thiol groups become exposed simultaneously. None of the intermediates is compatible with sequential domain unfolding. Molecular dynamics simulation suggests that the stabilizing effect of the S-126C substitution is due to optimization of van der Waals interactions and packing. On the other hand, destabilization induced by the S-265C mutation results from alteration of the hydrogen-bond network. The results illustrate the large impact that seemingly conservative serine-to-cysteine changes can have on the energy landscape of proteins.",

        "title": "Molecular mechanism underlying the thermal stability and pH-induced unfolding of CHABII.", 
        "abstract": "The 37-residue alpha/beta protein CHABII was previously demonstrated to undergo a gradual pH-induced unfolding. It has been shown that even at pH 4.0 CHABII still retained a highly native-like secondary structure and tertiary topology although its tight side-chain packing was severely disrupted, typical of the molten globule state. Here, we have expressed and refolded the recombinant proteins of CHABII and its mutant [Phe21]-CHABII, and subsequently conducted extensive CD and NMR characterizations. The results indicated: (1) replacement of His21 by Phe in [Phe21]-CHABII eliminated the pH-induced unfolding from pH 6.5 to 4.0, indicating that His21 was responsible for the observed pH-induced unfolding of CHABII. Further examinations revealed that although the pH-induced unfolding of CHABII was also triggered by the protonation of the His residue as previously uncovered for apomyoglobin, their molecular mechanisms are different. (2) Monitoring the pH-induced unfolding by 1H-15N HSQC spectroscopy allowed us to visualize the gradual development of the CHABII molten globule. At pH 4.0, the HSQC spectrum of CHABII was poorly dispersed with dispersions of approximately 1 ppm over proton dimension and 10 ppm over 15N dimension, characteristic of severely or even \"completely unfolded\" proteins. One the other hand, unambiguous assignments of the NOESY spectra of CHABII led to the identification of the persistent medium and long-range NOEs at pH 4.0, which define a highly native-like secondary structure and tertiary packing. This implies that the degree of the native-like topology might be underestimated in the previous characterization of partially folded and even completely unfolded proteins. (3) Replacement of His21 by Phe with higher side-chain hydrophobicity only caused a minor structural rearrangement but considerably enhanced the packing interaction of the hydrophobic core, as evident from a dramatic increase in NOE contacts in [Phe21]-CHABII. The enhancement led to an increase of the thermal stability of [Phe21]-CHABII by approximately 17 deg. C.",

        "abstract": "Glutamine synthetase (GS), Mr 622,000, from Escherichia coli contains 12 active sites formed at heterologous interfaces between subunits [Almassy, R. J., Janson, C. A., Hamlin, R., Xuong, N.-H., & Eisenberg, D. (1986) Nature (London) 323, 304-309]. Temperature-induced changes in UV spectra from 3 to 68 degrees C were reversible with the Mn2+- or Mg2+-enzyme at pH 7.0 (50 degrees C) in 100 mM KCl. No dissociation or aggregation of dodecamer occurred at high temperatures. The thermal transition involves the exposure of approximately 0.7 of the 2 Trp residues/subunit (by UV difference spectroscopy) and 2 of the 17 Tyr residues/subunit (change in exposure from 4.7 to 6.7 Tyr/subunit by second-derivative spectral analysis). Monitoring changes in Trp and Tyr exposure independently gives data that conform to a two-state model for partial unfolding with Tm values (where delta G unfolding = 0) differing by 2-3 degrees C at each level of [Mn2+] studied and with average delta HvH values of 80 and 94 kcal/mol, respectively. These observations suggest that two regions of the oligomeric structure unfold separately as independent transitions (random model). However, the data can be fit equally with a sequential model in which the Trp transition occurs first upon heating. By fitting with either model, Tm values increase from approximately 47 to approximately 54 degrees C with increasing free [Mn2+] from 3.6 to 49 microM but decrease from approximately 54 to approximately 43 degrees C by further increasing free [Mn2+] from 0.05 to 10 mM; such behavior indicates that the high-temperature form of the enzyme binds Mn2+ more weakly but has more binding sites than the native enzyme. The high-temperature Mn-enzyme form is somewhat less unfolded than is the catalytically inactive apoenzyme, which undergoes no further Trp or Tyr exposure on heating and therefore is assumed to be the high-temperature form of divalent cation-free GS. Adding substrates [ADP, L-Met-(SR)-sulfoximine, Gln, Gln + NH2OH, or Gln + ADP] to Mn.GS increased Tm to varying extents by preferential binding to the folded form. Indeed, the transition-state analogue complex GS.(Mn2.ADP.L-Met-(S)-sulfoximine phosphate)12 was stable in the folded form to at least 72 degrees C. Moreover, an Arrhenius plot for gamma-glutamyl transfer activity was linear from 4 to 72 degrees C with Ea = 18.3 kcal/mol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The reversible folding and unfolding of barley chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) appears to be a rare example in which both equilibria and kinetics are described by a two-state model. Equilibrium denaturation by guanidinium chloride and heat is completely reversible, and the data can be fitted to a simple two-state model involving only native and denatured forms. The free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant, delta GH2O, at pH 6.3, is calculated to be 7.03 +/- 0.16 and 7.18 +/- 0.43 kcal mol-1 for guanidinium chloride and thermal denaturation, respectively. Scanning microcalorimetry shows that the ratio of the van't Hoff enthalpy of denaturation to the calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation does not deviate from unity, the value observed for a two-state transition, over the pH range 2.2-3.5. The heat capacity change for denaturation is found to be 0.789 kcal mol-1 K-1. The rate of unfolding of CI2 is first order and increases exponentially with increasing guanidinium chloride concentration. Refolding, however, is complex and involves at least three well-resolved phases. The three phases result from heterogeneity of the unfolded form due to proline isomerization. The fast phase, 77% of the amplitude, corresponds to the refolding of the fraction of the protein that has all its prolines in a native trans conformation. The rate of this major phase decreases exponentially with increasing guanidinium chloride concentration. The unfolding and refolding kinetics can also be fitted to a two-state model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The refolding of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) is, at least, a triphasic process. The rate constants are 53 s-1 for the major phase (77% of the total amplitude) and 0.43 and 0.024 s-1 for the slower phases (23% of the total amplitude) at 25 degrees C and pH 6.3. The multiphase nature of the refolding reaction results from heterogeneity in the denatured state because of proline isomerization. The fast phase corresponds to the refolding of the fraction of protein that has all its prolines in a native trans conformation in the denatured state. It is not catalyzed by peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. The rate-limiting step of folding for the slower phases, however, is proline isomerization, and they are both catalyzed by peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. The slowest phase has properties consistent with a process involving proline isomerization in a denatured state. In particular, the activation enthalpy is large, 16 kcal mol-1 K-1, and the rate is independent of guanidinium chloride concentration ([GdnHCl]). In comparison, the intermediate phase shows properties consistent with a process involving proline isomerization in a partially structured state. The activation enthalpy is small, 8 kcal mol-1 K-1, and the rate has a strong dependence on [GdnHCl]. Temperature dependences of the rate constants for unfolding and for the fast refolding phase, both in the absence and in the presence of GdnHCl, were used to characterize the thermodynamic nature of the transition state and its relative exposure to solvent. The Eyring plot for unfolding is linear, indicating that there is relatively little change in heat capacity between native state and transition state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The in vivo activities of mutant proteins are readily measured and can potentially be used to estimate changes in in vitro properties such as stability or function, but this connection has not been rigorously established. Gene V protein is a small protein produced by bacteriophage f1 that binds to single-stranded DNA and to RNA and for which fitness can be assayed both in vivo and in vitro. We have assembled a large number of temperature-sensitive mutants of the gene V protein of bacteriophage f1 and measured their ability to support phage growth and replication in vivo. We have also purified many of these mutant gene V proteins and measured their stabilities and ssDNA binding affinities in vitro. Mutations at surface residues frequently yielded temperature-sensitive mutants, but remarkably, no overall correlation between in vivo activity and in vitro measures of either stability or function was found for this group. Mutations at buried residues often lead to the temperature-sensitive phenotype. At buried sites temperature sensitivity was strongly correlated with in vitro stability changes, but not with in vitro ssDNA binding affinity. The implication of these observations for protein engineering efforts is that phenotypes conferred by amino acid substitutions at buried sites can be used to identify mutants whose stabilities fall into ranges of interest, while phenotypes of mutants with surface substitutions may be much less readily interpreted, even in the case of a single-stranded-DNA-binding protein.",

        "abstract": "The bacterial cold shock proteins are small compact beta-barrel proteins without disulfide bonds, cis-proline residues or tightly bound cofactors. Bc-Csp, the cold shock protein from the thermophile Bacillus caldolyticus shows a twofold increase in the free energy of stabilization relative to its homolog Bs-CspB from the mesophile Bacillus subtilis, although the two proteins differ by only 12 out of 67 amino acid residues. This pair of cold shock proteins thus represents a good system to study the atomic determinants of protein thermostability. Bs-CspB and Bc-Csp both unfold reversibly in cooperative transitions with T(M) values of 49.0 degrees C and 77.3 degrees C, respectively, at pH 7.0. Addition of 0.5 M salt stabilizes Bs-CspB but destabilizes Bc-Csp. To understand these differences at the structural level, the crystal structure of Bc-Csp was determined at 1.17 A resolution and refined to R=12.5% (R(free)=17.9%). The molecular structures of Bc-Csp and Bs-CspB are virtually identical in the central beta-sheet and in the binding region for nucleic acids. Significant differences are found in the distribution of surface charges including a sodium ion binding site present in Bc-Csp, which was not observed in the crystal structure of the Bs-CspB. Electrostatic interactions are overall favorable for Bc-Csp, but unfavorable for Bs-CspB. They provide the major source for the increased thermostability of Bc-Csp. This can be explained based on the atomic-resolution crystal structure of Bc-Csp. It identifies a number of potentially stabilizing ionic interactions including a cation-binding site and reveals significant changes in the electrostatic surface potential.",

        "abstract": "In Gram-negative bacteria, the introduction of disulfide bonds into folding proteins occurs in the periplasm and is catalyzed by donation of an energetically unstable disulfide from DsbA, which is subsequently re-oxidized through interaction with DsbB. Gram-positive bacteria lack a classic periplasm but nonetheless encode Dsb-like proteins. Staphylococcus aureus encodes just one Dsb protein, a DsbA, and no DsbB. Here we report the crystal structure of S. aureus DsbA (SaDsbA), which incorporates a thioredoxin fold with an inserted helical domain, like its Escherichia coli counterpart EcDsbA, but it lacks the characteristic hydrophobic patch and has a truncated binding groove near the active site. These findings suggest that SaDsbA has a different substrate specificity than EcDsbA. Thermodynamic studies indicate that the oxidized and reduced forms of SaDsbA are energetically equivalent, in contrast to the energetically unstable disulfide form of EcDsbA. Further, the partial complementation of EcDsbA by SaDsbA is independent of EcDsbB and biochemical assays show that SaDsbA does not interact with EcDsbB. The identical stabilities of oxidized and reduced SaDsbA may facilitate direct re-oxidation of the protein by extracellular oxidants, without the need for DsbB.",

For wild-type nuclease at pH 7.0, a Tm of 53.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C and a delta Happ of 86.8 +/- 1.4 kcal/mol were obtained, in reasonable agreement with values determined calorimetrically, 52.8 degrees C and 96 +/- 2 kcal/mol. The heat capacity change on denaturation delta Cp was estimated at 1.8 kcal/(mol K) versus the calorimetric value of 2.2 kcal/(mol K). When values of delta Happ and delta Sapp for a series of mutant nucleases that exhibit markedly altered denaturation behavior with guanidine hydrochloride and urea were compared at the same temperature, compensating changes in enthalpy and entropy were observed that greatly reduce the overall effect of the mutations on the free energy of denaturation. In addition, a correlation was found between the estimated delta Cp for the mutant proteins and the d(delta Gapp)/dC for guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. It is proposed that both the enthalpy/entropy compensation and this correlation between two seemingly unrelated denaturation parameters are consequences of large changes in the solvation of the denatured state that result from the mutant amino acid substitutions.",

        "abstract": "Flavodoxin is an essential protein for Helicobacter pylori, a pathogen living in the very acidic environment of the gastric tract and responsible for several diseases. We report the conformational stability of the protein in neutral and acidic pH. The apoprotein remains native between pH 12 and 5 and adopts a monomeric molten globule conformation at more acidic pH values. The equilibrium unfolding in urea appears two-state for either conformation, but the native one coexists with a hidden equilibrium intermediate of very similar properties. The stability of H. pylori apoflavodoxin is higher than that of the Anabaena homologue throughout the entire pH interval, which may be related to better charge compensation. H. pylori apoflavodoxin is strongly stabilized by its FMN cofactor. A global analysis of apo- and holoflavodoxin equilibrium unfolding, with and without excess FMN, indicates that the cofactor only binds to the native state. Some physical-chemical properties of the protein may represent an adaptation to the acidic environment. Unlike the apoflavodoxin from Anabaena, which becomes highly insoluble at pH 5.0, that from H. pylori remains soluble to at least 40 microm. This fact, together with the high stability of the apoprotein at this low pH that can arise in the bacteria cytoplasm, seems useful to allow newly synthesized apoflavodoxin molecules to fold and remain soluble to accomplish cofactor binding, which in turn increases the stability. Also, whenever the cytoplasmic pH drops to 5, preexisting flavodoxin molecules will remain folded and soluble and will retain the FMN cofactor, thus remaining functional.",

The equilibrium unfolding/refolding of apo-ACF II, holo-ACF II, and Tb(3+)-reconstituted ACF II in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) solutions was studied by following the fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD). Metal ions were found to increase the structural stability of ACF II against GdnHCl and irreversible thermal denaturation and, furthermore, influence its unfolding/refolding behavior. The GdnHCl-induced unfolding/refolding of both apo-ACF II and Tb(3+)-ACF II is a two-state process with no detectable intermediate state, while the GdnHCl-induced unfolding/refolding of holo-ACF II in the presence of 1 mM Ca(2+) follows a three-state transition with an intermediate state. Ca(2+) ions play an important role in the stabilization of both native and I states of holo-ACF II. The decalcification of holo-ACF II shifts the ending zone of unfolding/refolding curve toward lower GdnHCl concentration, while the reconstitution of apo-ACF II with Tb(3+) ions shifts the initial zone of the denaturation curve toward higher GdnHCl concentration. Therefore, it is possible to find a denaturant concentration (2.1 M GdnHCl) at which refolding from the fully denatured state of apo-ACF II to the I state of holo-ACF II or to the native state of Tb(3+)-ACF II can be initiated merely by adding the 1 mM Ca(2+) ions or 10 microM Tb(3+) ions to the unfolded state of apo-ACF II, respectively, without changing the concentration of the denaturant. Using Tb(3+) as a fluorescence probe of Ca(2+), the kinetic results of metal ion-induced refolding provide evidence for the fact that the first phase of Tb(3+)-induced refolding should involve the formation of the compact metal-binding site regions, and subsequently, the protein undergoes further conformational rearrangements to form the native structure.",

Fully buried hydrophobic side chains were exchanged for similar side chains at sites corresponding to midhelical positions in the native state. The results show a positive correlation between the alpha-helix-forming ability of the substituted side chain and the stability of the mutant proteins, when differences between the size of the side chains are taken into account. If, in addition, each type of amino acid substitution is averaged over different sites, the helix propensities of the amino acids account for much of the residual variation. This implies that the stability of the native state of a protein is coupled to that of secondary structural elements in the structure. In magnitude, the net contribution of propensity differences is smaller than hydrophobic effects, but not negligible in terms of the net free energy of unfolding.",

        "abstract": "In complex with subtilisin BPN', the 77 amino acid prodomain folds into a stable compact structure comprising a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and two three-turn alpha-helices. When isolated from subtilisin, the prodomain is 97% unfolded even under optimal folding conditions. Traditionally, to study stable proteins, denaturing cosolvents or temperatures are used to shift the equilibrium from folded to unfolded. Here we manipulate the folding equilibrium of the unstable prodomain by introducing stabilizing mutations generated by design. By sequentially introducing three stabilizing mutations into the prodomain we are able to shift the equilibrium for independent folding from 97% unfolded to 65% folded. Spectroscopic and thermodynamic analysis of the folding reaction was carried out to assess the effect of stability on two-state behavior and the denatured state. The denatured states of single and combination mutants are not discernably different in spite of a range of DeltaGunfolding from -2.1 to 0.4 kcal/mol. Conclusions about the nature of the denatured state of the prodomain are based on CD spectral data and calorimetric data. Two state folding is observed for a combination mutant of marginal stability (DeltaG = 0). Evidence for its two-state folding is based on the observed additivity of individual mutations to the overall DeltaGunfolding and the conformity of DeltaGunfolding vs T to two-state assumptions as embodied in the Gibbs-Helmholz equation. We believe our success in stabilizing the two-state folding reaction of the prodomain originates from the selection of mutations with improved ability to fold subtilisin rather than selection for increase in secondary structure content. The fact that a small number of mutations can stabilize the independent folding of the prodomain implies that most of the folding information already exists in the wild-type amino acid sequence in spite of the fact that the unfolded state predominates.",

        "abstract": "We have determined the sequence of mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt-c) from the goat heart, and it was found to have a unique amino acid sequence among all amino acid sequences of cyt-c reported till date. Its sequence alignment with the bovine cytochrome c (b-cyt-c) led us to conclude that the goat cytochrome c (g-cyt-c) differs in amino acid sequence from b-cyt-c at only one position, i.e., Pro44(bovine) --> Ala44(goat). It has been observed that guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) induces a two-state transition between the native (N) and denatured (D) states of g-cyt-c. This conclusion is reached from the coincidence of GdmCl-induced transition curves monitored by measurements of absorbance at 405, 530 and 695 nm and circular dichroism (CD) at 222, 416 and 405 nm. Analysis of denaturation curves for the Gibbs energy of stabilization suggests that the stability of g-cyt-c is, within experimental errors, identical to that of b-cyt-c. We have also measured the effect of temperature on the equilibrium, N state <--> D state of g-cyt-c in the presence of different GdmCl concentrations. These measurements gave values of transition temperature (T(m)), changes in enthalpy (DeltaH(m)) and heat capacity (DeltaC(p)) of g-cyt-c in the absence of GdmCl, which are compared with those of b-cyt-c. We have used crystal structure coordinates of b-cyt-c to predict the structure and stability of g-cyt-c, which are compared with those of the bovine protein.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the question of whether the burial of polar and nonpolar groups in the protein locale is indeed accompanied by the heat capacity changes, DeltaC(p), that have an opposite sign, negative for nonpolar groups and positive for polar groups. To accomplish this, we introduced amino acid substitutions at four fully buried positions of the ubiquitin molecule (Val5, Val17, Leu67, and Gln41). We substituted Val at positions 5 and 17 and Leu at position 67 with a polar residue, Asn. As a control, Ala was introduced at the same three positions. We also replaced the buried polar Gln41 with Val and Leu, nonpolar residues that have similar size and shape as Gln. As a control, Asn was introduced at Gln41 as well. The effects of these amino acid substitutions on the stability, and in particular, on the heat capacity change upon unfolding were measured using differential scanning calorimetry. The effect of the amino acid substitutions on the structure was also evaluated by comparing the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra of the ubiquitin variants. It was found that the Ala substitutions did not have a considerable effect on the heat capacity change upon unfolding. However, the substitutions of aliphatic side chains (Val or Leu) with a polar residue (Asn) lead to a significant (> 30%) decrease in the heat capacity change upon unfolding. The decrease in heat capacity changes does not appear to be the result of significant structural perturbations as seen from the HSQC spectra of the variants. The substitution of a buried polar residue (Gln41) to a nonpolar residue (Leu or Val) leads to a significant (> 25%) increase in heat capacity change upon unfolding. These results indicate that indeed the heat capacity change of burial of polar and nonpolar groups has an opposite sign. However, the observed changes in DeltaC(p) are several times larger than those predicted, based on the changes in water accessible surface area upon substitution.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium folding behavior of recombinant human FK-binding protein, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase, was examined by urea-induced denaturation using probes of protein structure including intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, second-derivative UV absorbance, CD, and NMR. All optical probes of protein structure indicate that FKBP is capable of folding reversibly. The second-derivative UV absorbance and CD probes of the structure exhibited urea denaturation transitions at approximately 4.3 M urea. The fluorescence of the single protein tryptophan is quenched in the folded state. During the unfolding-folding transition, the unquenching of tryptophan fluorescence occurs at a slightly lower urea concentration (3.9 M urea) than the changes observed for the other optical probes of folding. These probes of structure demonstrate little dependence on protein concentration in the range of 0.2- approximately 3 mg/mL across the urea-induced denaturation transition. The reversibility of the unfolding-folding transition was confirmed from two-dimensional 15N/1H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of [U-15N]FKBP. In addition, the native-denatured transitions for 57 individual amino acids were determined from an analysis of these spectra acquired at different urea concentrations. Analysis of the transitions for all clearly observable HSQC cross peaks for residues distributed throughout the protein and comparison to the optical folding transitions, indicate that FKBP global folding is consistent with a two-state process. Although direct measurement of FKBP catalytic activity in urea was complex, enzyme activity was observed up to the beginning of the FKBP urea-denaturation transition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Hsp70 proteins like DnaK bind unfolded polypeptides in a nucleotide-dependent manner. The switch from high-affinity ADP-state to low- affinity ATP-state with concomitant substrate release is accelerated significantly by GrpE proteins. GrpE thus fulfils an important role in regulation of the chaperone cycle. Here, we analysed the thermal stability of GrpE from Thermus thermophilus using differential scanning calorimetry and CD-spectroscopy. The protein exhibits unusual unfolding characteristics with two observable thermal transitions. The first transition is CD-spectroscopically silent with a transition midpoint at 90 degrees C. The second transition, mainly constituting the CD-signal, ranges between 100 and 105 degrees C depending on the GrpE(Tth) concentration, according to the model N(2) <==> I(2) <==> 2U. Using a C-terminally truncated version of GrpE(Tth) it was possible to assign the second thermal transition to the dimerisation of GrpE(Tth), while the first transition represents the completely reversible unfolding of the globular C-terminal domain. The unfolding of this domain is accompanied by a distinct decrease in nucleotide exchange rates and impaired binding to DnaK(Tth). Under heat shock conditions, the DnaK-ADP-protein-substrate complex is thus stabilised by a reversibly inactivated GrpE-protein that refolds under permissive conditions. In combination with studies on GrpE from Escherichia coli presented recently by Christen and co-workers, it thus appears that the general role of GrpE is to function as a thermosensor that modulates nucleotide exchange rates in a temperature-dependent manner to prevent substrate dissociation at non-permissive conditions.",

In the present work, we have examined the molten globule state of Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase (BLA) by intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra, 1-anilino naphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) binding and proteolytic digestion by pepsin, for comparison to its mesophilic counterpart, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase (BAA). At pH 4.0, both enzymes acquire partially folded state which show characteristics of molten globule state. They unfold in such a way that their hydrophobic surfaces are exposed to a greater extent compared to the native forms. Chemical denaturation studies by guanidine hydrochloride and proteolytic digestion with pepsin show that molten globule state of BLA is more stable than from BAA. Results from gel filtration indicate that BAA has the same compactness at pH 4.0 and 7.5. However, molten globule state of BLA is less compact than its native state. The effects of polyols such as trehalose, sorbitol and glycerol on refolding of enzymes from molten globule to native state were also studied. These polyols are effective on refolding of mesophilic alpha-amylase but only slightly effect on BLA refolding. In addition, the folding pathway and stability of intermediate state of the thermophilic and the mesophilic alpha-amylases are discussed.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between the degradation rate of a protein in Escherichia coli and its thermal stability in vitro, we constructed a set of variants of the N-terminal domain of lambda repressor with a wide range of melting temperatures. Pulse-chase experiments showed that, within this set, the proteins that are most thermally stable have the longest intracellular half-lives and vice versa. Moreover, second-site mutations which act directly or indirectly to increase the thermodynamic stability of the native N-terminal domain were found to suppress the intracellular degradation of one of the unstable mutants. These data suggest that thermal stability is, indeed, a key determinant of the proteolytic susceptibility of this protein in the cell. It is not the sole determinant, however, as sequences at the extreme C terminus of the N-terminal domain can influence proteolytic sensitivity without affecting the stability of the native structure. We propose that the thermal stability of the N-terminal domain of lambda repressor is an important determinant of its proteolytic sensitivity because degradation proceeds primarily from the unfolded form and that sequence determinants within the unfolded chain influence whether the unfolded protein will be a good substrate for proteolytic enzymes.",

        "abstract": "The flavoprotein cholesterol oxidase (CO) from Brevibacterium sterolicum is a monomeric flavoenzyme containing one molecule of FAD cofactor covalently linked to His69. The elimination of the covalent link following the His69Ala substitution was demonstrated to result in a significant decrease in activity, in the midpoint redox potential of the flavin, and in stability with respect to the wild-type enzyme, but does not modify the overall structure of the enzyme. We used CO as a model system to dissect the changes due to the elimination of the covalent link between the flavin and the protein (by comparing the wild-type and H69A CO holoproteins) with those due to the elimination of the cofactor (by comparing the holo- and apoprotein forms of H69A CO). The apoprotein of H69A CO lacks the characteristic tertiary structure of the holoprotein and displays larger hydrophobic surfaces; its urea-induced unfolding does not occur by a simple two-state mechanism and is largely nonreversible. Minor alterations in the flavin binding region are evident between the native and the refolded proteins, and are likely responsible for the low refolding yield observed. A model for the equilibrium unfolding of H69A CO that also takes into consideration the effects of cofactor binding and dissociation, and thus may be of general significance in terms of the relationships between cofactor uptake and folding in flavoproteins, is presented.",

In this study, we investigated the urea-dependent behavior of the protein labeled with 6-fluorotryptophan (6-(19)F-Trp). The (19)F NMR spectrum of 6-(19)F-Trp-labeled mADA reveals four distinct resonances in the native state and three partly overlapped resonances in the unfolded state. The resonances were assigned unambiguously by site-directed mutagenesis. Equilibrium unfolding of 6-(19)F-Trp-labeled mADA was monitored using (19)F NMR based on these assignments. The changes in intensity of folded and unfolded resonances as a function of urea concentration show transition midpoints consistent with data observed by far-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy, indicating that conformational changes in mADA during urea unfolding can be followed by (19)F NMR. Chemical shifts of the (19)F resonances exhibited different changes between 1.0 and 6.0 M urea, indicating that local structures around 6-(19)F-Trp residues change differently. The urea-induced changes in local structure around four 6-(19)F-Trp residues of mADA were analyzed on the basis of the tertiary structure and chemical shifts of folded resonances. The results reveal that different local regions in mADA have different urea-dependent behavior, and that local regions of mADA change sequentially from native to intermediate topologies on the unfolding pathway.",

It was found that this heat-labile enzyme is the largest known multidomain protein exhibiting a reversible two-state unfolding, as demonstrated by the recovery of DeltaHcal values after consecutive calorimetric transitions, a DeltaHcal/DeltaHeff ratio close to unity, and the independence of unfolding thermodynamic parameters of scan rates. By contrast, the mesophilic alpha-amylases investigated here (from porcine pancreas, human salivary glands, yellow meal beetle, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and Bacillus licheniformis) unfold irreversibly according to a non-two-state mechanism. Unlike mesophilic alpha-amylases, the melting point of AHA is independent of calcium and chloride binding while the allosteric and structural functions of these ions are conserved. The thermostability of AHA at optimal conditions is characterized by a Tm of 43.7 degrees C, a DeltaHcal of 238 kcal mol-1, and a DeltaCp of 8.47 kcal mol-1 K-1. These values were used to calculate the Gibbs free energy of unfolding over a wide range of temperatures. This stability curve shows that (a) the specific DeltaGmax of AHA [22 cal (mol of residue)-1] is 4 times lower than that of mesophilic alpha-amylases, (b) group hydration plays a crucial role in the enzyme flexibility at low temperatures, (c) the temperature of cold unfolding closely corresponds to the lower limit of bacterial growth, and (d) the recombinant heat-labile enzyme can be expressed in mesophilic hosts at moderate temperatures. It is also argued that the cold-active alpha-amylase has evolved toward the lowest possible conformational stability of its native state.",

        "abstract": "The dimeric form of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase provides a valuable experimental system for studying transitions between native, partially unfolded, and unfolded states since long-lived partially unfolded states can be generated by chemical modification of a nonconserved buried cysteine residue, Cys 231, by denaturing agents, by oxidative stress, and by thermal inactivation. Elucidation of the 3D structures of complexes of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase with a repertoire of reversible inhibitors permits their classification into three categories: (a) active-site directed inhibitors, which interact with the catalytic anionic subsite, at the bottom of the active-site gorge, such as edrophonium and tacrine; (b) peripheral anionic site inhibitors, which interact with a site at the entrance to the gorge, such as propidium and d-tubocurarine; and (c) elongated gorge-spanning inhibitors, which bridge the two sites, such as BW284c51 and decamethonium. The effects of these three categories of reversible inhibitors on the stability of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase were investigated using spectroscopic techniques and differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic parameters obtained calorimetrically permitted quantitative comparison of the effects of the inhibitors on the enzyme's thermal stability. Peripheral site inhibitors had a relatively small effect, while gorge-spanning ligands and those binding at the catalytic anionic site, had a much larger stabilizing effect. The strongest effect was, however, observed with the polypeptide toxin, fasciculin II (FasII), even though, in terms of its binding site, it belongs to the category of peripheral site ligands. The stabilizing effect of the ligands binding at the anionic subsite of the active site, like that of the gorge-spanning ligands, may be ascribed to their capacity to stabilize the interaction between the two subdomains of the enzyme. The effect of fasciculin II may be ascribed to the large surface area of interaction (>2000 A(2)) between the two proteins. Stabilization of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase by both divalent cations and chemical chaperones was earlier shown to be due to a shift in equilibrium between the native state and a partially unfolded state ( Millard et al. ( 2003 ) Protein Sci. 12 , 2337 - 2347 ). The low molecular weight inhibitors used in the present study may act similarly and can thus be considered as pharmacological chaperones for stabilizing the fully folded native form of the enzyme.",

The kinetics of fibril formation of LEN, a benign light chain variable domain, were investigated at physiological pH in the presence of urea. Despite the lack of in vivo fibril formation, LEN readily forms fibrils in vitro under mildly destabilizing conditions. The effect of low to moderate concentrations of urea on the conformation, association state, stability, and kinetics of fibrillation of LEN were investigated. The conformation of LEN was only slightly affected by the addition of up to 4 m urea. The fibrillation kinetics were highly dependent on protein and urea concentrations, becoming faster with decreasing protein concentration and increasing urea concentration. Changes in spectral probes were concomitant to fibril formation throughout the protein and urea concentration ranges, indicating the absence of off-pathway oligomeric species or amorphous aggregates prior to fibril formation. Reducing the amount of dimers initially present in solution by either decreasing the protein concentration or adding urea resulted in faster fibril formation. Thus, increasing concentrations of urea, by triggering dissociation of dimeric LEN, lead to increased rates of fibrillation.",

The excess heat capacity function of (H+,K+)-ATPase in highly oriented gastric vesicles displays two peaks at 53.9 degrees C (Tm1) and 61.8 degrees C (Tm2). Its thermal denaturation is an irreversible process that does not exhibit kinetic control and can be resolved in two independent two-state processes. They can be assigned to two cooperative domains located in the cytoplasmic loops of the alpha-subunit, according to the disappearance of the endothermic signal upon removal of these regions by proteinase K digestion. Analysis of the thermal-induced unfolding of the enzyme trapped in different catalytic cycle intermediates has allowed us to get insight into the E1-E2 conformational change. In the E1 forms both transitions are always observed. As Tm1 is shifted to Tm2 by vanadate and ATP interaction, the unfolding mechanism changes from two independent to two sequential two-state transitions, revealing interdomain interactions. Stabilization of the E2 forms results in the disappearance of the second transition at saturation by K+, Mg2+-ATP, and Mg2+-vanadate as well as in significant changes in Tm2 and DeltaH1. The catalytic domain melts following a process in which intermolecular interactions either in the native or in the unfolded state might be involved.

Crystal structure analysis of the mutant proteins shows that the introduced amino acids are accommodated with very little perturbation of the three-dimensional structure. Incorporation of the more bulky hydrophobic residues within the core of the protein is expected to provide an increase in hydrophobic stabilization, but this is seen to be offset by the introduction of strain. Inspection of the mutant structures shows that in each case the introduced amino acid side chain is forced to adopt a non-optimal dihedral angle X1. Strain is also observed in the form of bond angle distortion and in unfavorable van der Waals contacts. The results illustrate how the observed core structures of proteins represent a compromise between the hydrophobic effect, which will tend to maximize the core packing density, and the strain energy that would be incurred in eliminating all packing defects. The results also suggest that mutations designed to increase protein stability by filling existing cavities may be effective in some cases but are unlikely to provide a general method for increasing protein stability.",

Such variants are active and fold cooperatively with progressively reduced stability. The structure of a seven-methionine variant has been shown, crystallographically, to be similar to wild type and to maintain a well ordered core. The interaction between the core residues is, therefore, not strictly comparable with the precise spatial complementarity of the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Rather, a certain amount of give and take in forming the core structure is permitted. A simplified hydrophobic core sequence, imposed without genetic selection or computer-based design, is sufficient to retain native properties in a globular protein.",

The physical properties of these four mutants indicate that their native structure is essentially identical to that of wild-type RNase A. The disulfide-intact forms of these proteins were denatured in guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn.HCl) and then refolded by dilution of the Gdn.HCl. Single-jump folding, single-jump unfolding, and double-jump unfolding/folding stopped-flow experiments were carried out on wild-type and the four proline mutants of RNase A using absorption detection to follow the folding kinetics. The single-jump folding experiments carried out at six different final Gdn.HCl concentrations indicate that the folding rate constants of individual steps for the mutants are similar to those of wild-type RNase A. The Tyr92-Pro93 peptide bond has a cis conformation in native wild-type RNase A, and the results from our double-jump stopped-flow experiments indicate that the Tyr92-Ala93 peptide bond in the P93A mutant of RNase A is also cis in the native state. The existence of two cis peptide bonds (preceding Pro93 and Pro114) in wild-type RNase A is probably due to (as-yet-unidentified) long-range interactions, and such interactions are presumably the origin of a cis peptide bond even when alanine is substituted for Pro93. The data from the double-jump stopped-flow experiments are interpreted in terms of a folding/unfolding model. This model specifies the cis/trans isomerization state of the unfolded species (Uvf, Uf, Um, and Us) at each X-Pro peptide bond. Also, this model confirms the existence of several previously postulated chain-folding initiation sites.",

        "abstract": "The folding thermodynamics and kinetics of the alpha-spectrin SH3 domain with a redesigned hydrophobic core have been studied. The introduction of five replacements, A11V, V23L, M25V, V44I and V58L, resulted in an increase of 16% in the overall volume of the side-chains forming the hydrophobic core but caused no remarkable changes to the positions of the backbone atoms. Judging by the scanning calorimetry data, the increased stability of the folded structure of the new SH3-variant is caused by entropic factors, since the changes in heat capacity and enthalpy upon the unfolding of the wild-type and mutant proteins were identical at 298 K. It appears that the design process resulted in an increase in burying both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, which resulted in a compensatory effect upon the changes in heat capacity and enthalpy. Kinetic analysis shows that both the folding and unfolding rate constants are higher for the new variant, suggesting that its transition state becomes more stable compared to the folded and unfolded states. The phi(double dagger-U) values found for a number of side-chains are slightly lower than those of the wild-type protein, indicating that although the transition state ensemble (TSE) did not change overall, it has moved towards a more denatured conformation, in accordance with Hammond's postulate. Thus, the acceleration of the folding-unfolding reactions is caused mainly by an improvement in the specific and/or non-specific hydrophobic interactions within the TSE rather than by changes in the contact order. Experimental evidence showing that the TSE changes globally according to its hydrophobic content suggests that hydrophobicity may modulate the kinetic behaviour and also the folding pathway of a protein.",

        "abstract": "The dimeric yeast protein Ure2 shows prion-like behaviour in vivo and forms amyloid fibrils in vitro. A dimeric intermediate is populated transiently during refolding and is apparently stabilized at lower pH, conditions suggested to favour Ure2 fibril formation. Here we present a quantitative analysis of the effect of pH on the thermodynamic stability of Ure2 in Tris and phosphate buffers over a 100-fold protein concentration range. We find that equilibrium denaturation is best described by a three-state model via a dimeric intermediate, even under conditions where the transition appears two-state by multiple structural probes. The free energy for complete unfolding and dissociation of Ure2 is up to 50 kcal mol(-1). Of this, at least 20 kcal mol(-1) is contributed by inter-subunit interactions. Hence the native dimer and dimeric intermediate are significantly more stable than either of their monomeric counterparts. The previously observed kinetic unfolding intermediate is suggested to represent the dissociated native-like monomer. The native state is stabilized with respect to the dimeric intermediate at higher pH and in Tris buffer, without significantly affecting the dissociation equilibrium. The effects of pH, buffer, protein concentration and temperature on the kinetics of amyloid formation were quantified by monitoring thioflavin T fluorescence. The lag time decreases with increasing protein concentration and fibril formation shows pseudo-first order kinetics, consistent with a nucleated assembly mechanism. In Tris buffer the lag time is increased, suggesting that stabilization of the native state disfavours amyloid nucleation.",

        "abstract": "Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions (\"Core-7\") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein (\"Core-10\") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.",

        "abstract": "A \"folding element\" is a contiguous peptide segment crucial for a protein to be foldable and is a new concept that could assist in our understanding of the protein-folding problem. It is known that the presence of the complete set of folding elements of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherichia coli is essential for the protein to be foldable. Since almost all of the amino acid residues known to be involved in the early folding events of DHFR are located within the folding elements, a close relationship between the folding elements and early folding events is hypothesized. In order to test this hypothesis, we have investigated whether or not the early folding events are preserved in circular permutants and topological mutants of DHFR, in which the order of the folding elements is changed but the complete set of folding elements is present. The stopped-flow circular dichroism (CD) measurements show that the CD spectra at the early stages of folding are similar among the mutants and the wild-type DHFR, indicating that the presence of the complete set of folding elements is sufficient to preserve the early folding events. We have further examined whether or not sequence perturbation on the folding elements by a single amino acid substitution affects the early folding events of DHFR. The results show that the amino acid substitutions inside of the folding elements can affect the burst-phase CD spectra, whereas the substitutions outside do not. Taken together, these results indicate that the above hypothesis is true, suggesting a close relationship between the foldability of a protein and the early folding events. We propose that the folding elements interact with each other and coalesce to form a productive intermediate(s) early in the folding, and these early folding events are important for a protein to be foldable.",

The core structure of fusion-active gp41 is a six-helix bundle in which three antiparallel carboxyl-terminal helices are packed against an amino-terminal trimeric coiled coil. Here we show that a recombinant model of the SIV gp41 core, designated N36(L6)C34, forms an alpha-helical trimer that exhibits a cooperative two-state folding-unfolding transition. We investigate the importance of buried polar interactions in determining the overall fold of the gp41 core. We have replaced each of four polar amino acids at the heptad a and d positions of the coiled coil in N36(L6)C34 with a representative hydrophobic amino acid, isoleucine. The Q565I, T582I, and T586I variants form six-helix bundle structures that are significantly more stable than that of the wild-type peptide, whereas the Q575I variant misfolds into an insoluble aggregate under physiological conditions. Thus, the buried polar residues within the amino-terminal heptad repeat are important determinants of the structural specificity and stability of the gp41 core. We suggest that these conserved buried polar interactions play a role in governing the conformational state of the gp41 molecule.",

        "abstract": "Interest in the unfolded state of proteins has grown with the realization that this state can have considerable structure in the absence of denaturants. Natively unfolded proteins, mutations that unfold proteins under native conditions, and changes in pH that induce unfolding are attractive models for the unfolded state in the absence of denaturant. The unfolded state of the N-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L9 (NTL9) was previously shown to contain significant non-native electrostatic interactions [Cho, J. H., Sato, S., and Raleigh, D. P. (2004) J. Mol. Biol. 338, 827-837]. NTL9 has a mixed alpha-beta structure and folds via a two-state mechanism. We have generated a model of the unfolded state of NTL9 in the absence of denaturant by substitution of an alanine for phenylalanine 5 located in the core of this protein. The CD spectrum of the variant, denoted as F5A, exhibits significantly less structure than the wild type; however, the mean residue ellipticity of F5A at 222 nm (-8200 deg cm(2) dmol(-)(1)) is considerably larger than expected for a fully unfolded protein, indicating that residual secondary structure is populated. F5A also has more residual structure than the urea-unfolded wild type. The stability of F5A is estimated to be at least 1 kcal/mol unfavorable, showing that the unfolded state is populated to 84% or more. NMR pulsed-field gradient measurements yield a hydrodynamic radius of 16.1 A for wild-type NTL9 and 20.8 A for the F5A variant in native buffer. The physiologically relevant unfolded state of wild-type NTL9 is likely to be even more compact than F5A since the mutation should reduce the level of hydrophobic clustering in the unfolded state in the absence of denaturant. The hydrodynamic radius of F5A increases to 25.9 A in 8 M urea, and a value of 23.5 A is obtained for the wild type under similar conditions. The results show that the unfolded state of F5A in the absence of denaturant is more compact and contains more structure than the urea-unfolded form.",

The presence of two peaks was interpreted by the concept of 'heat-induced transition'. The BSA molecule is composed of two domains, thermodynamically independent owing to the formation of a crevice in BSA in a particular range of pH and ionic strength; this gives two peaks in the d.s.c. curve. The enthalpy (delta H) from the d.s.c. curve was plotted against pH and against the NaCl concentration. The value of delta H increased with the increase in the ionic strength in the pH range 5.6-9.0. The temperature of thermal denaturation (the temperature of the peak maximum, Td) was raised with the increase in the ionic strength in the pH range 4.5-9.0, but was lowered in the pH range 3.5-4.0.

BSA undergoes a heat-induced conformational transition in a particular range of pH and ionic strength and is separated into two thermally independent units, each of which has different thermostability in acidic and alkaline pH regions. Comparisons were made of the pH dependencies of the enthalpy of thermal denaturation (delta H) and the temperature of thermal denaturation (Td) in 0.01 M NaSCN with those in 0.01 M NaCl. It has been found that the stabilizing effect of NaSCN on BSA is larger than that of NaCl at pH 3.5-8, and that the heat-induced transition occurs by the electrostatic repulsive forces among the positively charged amino acid residues in a segment Arg 184-Arg 216 containing Trp 212 and the primary binding sites of anions. At ionic strength 0.01, the relative effectiveness of anions in suppressing the heat-induced transition and increasing the thermostability of BSA follows the order ClO4- - greater than or equal to SCN- greater than I- greater than SO4(2-) greater than Br- greater than Cl-. At ionic strength 0.1, the heat-induced transition is suppressing in all the salt solutions, and a Td increase follows the order ClO4- greater than or equal to SCN- greater than I- greater than Br- greater than Cl- greater than or equal to SO4(2-).

The structure of hisactophilin is typical of the beta-trefoil fold, a common structure adopted by diverse proteins with unrelated primary sequences and functions. The thermodynamics of denaturation of hisactophilin have been measured using fluorescence- and CD-monitored equilibrium urea denaturation curves, pH-denaturation, and thermal denaturation curves, as well as differential scanning calorimetry. Urea denaturation is reversible from pH 5.7 to pH 9.7; however, thermal denaturation is highly reversible only below pH approximately 6.2. Reversible denaturation by urea and heat is well fit using a two-state transition between the native and the denatured states. Urea denaturation curves are best fit using a quadratic dependence of the Gibbs free energy of unfolding upon urea concentration. Hisactophilin has moderate, roughly constant stability from pH 7.7 to pH 9.7; however, below pH 7.7, stability decreases markedly, most likely due to protonation of histidine residues. Enthalpic effects of histidine ionization upon unfolding also appear to be involved in the occurrence of cold unfolding of hisactophilin under relatively mild solution conditions. The stability data for hisactophilin are compared with data on hisactophilin function, and with data for two other beta-trefoil proteins, human interleukin-1beta, and basic fibroblast growth factor.",

In contrast, the unfolded protein in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) shows a 4-fold more intense emission band at 353 nm matching that of free tryptophan. The two-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of F45W ubiquitin was assigned by comparison with published assignments of the wild type. The mutation results in only limited chemical shift changes for residues in the immediate vicinity of residue 45. The structural similarity of F45W with wild-type ubiquitin was confirmed by a preliminary analysis of the nuclear Overhauser spectrum. NMR and circular dichroism measurements of the reversible GuHCl-induced unfolding transition show that the F45W mutation lowers the stability of the folded ubiquitin structure by less than 0.4 kcal/mol. The biological activity of the mutant was found to be indistinguishable from that of wild-type in terms of its reaction with the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 and an in vitro assay of ATP-dependent protein degradation. The kinetics of folding and unfolding of F45W ubiquitin was studied at two temperatures (8 and 25 degrees C) in a series of fluorescence-detected stopped-flow measurements over a wide range of GuHCl concentrations (0.5-6 M). The measurements at 25 degrees C are consistent with a two-state model with strongly denaturant-dependent folding and unfolding rates above about 2 M GuHCl. However, at lower denaturant concentrations, the rate of the major folding phase becomes GuHCl-independent, and up to 60% of the total fluorescence change occurs during the 2-ms dead time of the stopped-flow measurement. These observations provide clear evidence for the formation of an early folding intermediate during the first few milliseconds of refolding with a partially developed hydrophobic core involving Trp 45. The sigmoid denaturant dependence of the initial amplitude with an apparent midpoint of 1.3 M GuHCl suggests the presence of a discrete state that is destabilized at higher denaturant concentrations. In contrast, there is no evidence for an early intermediate in the folding kinetics at 8 degrees C. The destabilization of the intermediate at low temperature is consistent with a collapsed state stabilized primarily by hydrophobic interactions.",

        "abstract": "pH-Dependent studies of the folding kinetics and stability of a set of His to Gln point mutants were used to characterize the denatured state and transition state ensembles for the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 (CTL9). CTL9 contains three histidine residues, two of which, H106 and H134, are buried in the native state, while the third, H144, is more exposed. Comparison of the pH-dependent stability calculated using the Tanford-Wyman linkage relationship to the measured values demonstrates that the apparent pK(a) values of the three histidine residues are not significantly perturbed in the denatured state ensemble. Kinetic measurements show that mutation of H134 has a larger effect on the folding process than does mutation of H106 and H144. The Phi-value for H134 is significantly larger than the Phi-values for the other histidine residues, which are near zero at both pH 5.45 and pH 8.0. The Phi-value for H134 is higher, 0.55, at pH 8.0 than at pH 5.45, 0.39. At pH 5.45, H134 is protonated in the unfolded state but deprotonated in the native state, while at pH 8.0 it is deprotonated in both. There is an excellent linear relationship between stability (logK) and folding rates (logk(f)) over the range of pH 5-9 for all mutants. From these plots, the ratio of DeltaQ( not equal)/DeltaQ can be calculated for each mutant. DeltaQ( not equal) is the difference in the number of protons bound to the transition state and to the unfolded state, while DeltaQ represents the difference between folded and denatured state. The linear plots indicate that the relative position of the transition state ensemble as judged by DeltaQ( not equal)/DeltaQ is independent of pH. The linkage analysis is consistent with the Phi-value analysis, showing that H134 is the most critical contributor to the development of pH-dependent interactions, including desolvation effects in the transition state ensemble.",

        "abstract": "The thermal stability of the methionine repressor protein from Escherichia coli (MetJ) has been examined over a wide range of pH (pH 3.5-10) and ionic strength conditions using differential scanning calorimetry. Under reducing conditions, the transitions are fully reversible, and thermograms are characteristic of the cooperative unfolding of a globular protein with a molecular weight corresponding to the MetJ dimer, indicating that no dissociation of this dimeric protein occurs before unfolding of the polypeptide chains under most conditions. In the absence of reducing agent, repeated scans in the calorimeter show only partial reversibility, though the thermodynamic parameters derived from the first scans are comparable to those obtained under fully reversible conditions. The protein is maximally stable (Tm 58.5 degrees C) at about pH 6, close to the estimated isoelectric point, and stability is enhanced by increasing ionic strength in the range I = 0.01-0.4 M. The average calorimetric transition enthalpy (delta Hm) for the dimer is 505 +/- 28 kJ mol-1 under physiological conditions (pH 7, I = 0.125, Tm = 53.2 degrees C) and shows a small temperature dependence which is consistent with an apparent denaturational heat capacity change (delta Cp) of about +8.9 kJ K-1 mol-1. The effects of both pH and ionic strength on the transition temperature and free energy of MetJ unfolding are inconsistent with any single amino acid contribution and are more likely the result of more general electrostatic interactions, possibly including significant contributions from electrostatic repulsion between the like-charged monomers which can be modeled by a Debye-H\u00fcckel screened potential.",

        "abstract": "Anomalous NMR behavior of the hydroxyl proton resonance for Ser 31 has been reported for histidine-containing protein (HPr) from two microorganisms: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The unusual slow exchange and chemical shift exhibited by the resonance led to the proposal that the hydroxyl group is involved in a strong hydrogen bond. To test this hypothesis and to characterize the importance of such an interaction, a mutant in which Ser 31 is replaced by an alanine was generated in HPr from Escherichia coli. The activity, stability, and structure of the mutant HPr were assessed using a reconstituted assay system, analysis of solvent denaturation curves, and NMR, respectively. Substitution of Ser 31 yields a fully functional protein that is only slightly less stable (delta delta G(folding) = 0.46 +/- 0.15 kcal mol-1) than the wild type. The NMR results confirm the identity of the hydrogen bond acceptor as Asp 69 and reveal that it exists as the gauche- conformer in wild-type HPr in solution but exhibits conformational averaging in the mutant protein. The side chain of Asp 69 interacts with two main-chain amide proteins in addition to its interaction with the side chain of Ser 31 in the wild-type protein. These results indicate that removal of the serine has led to the loss of all three hydrogen bond interactions involving Asp 69, suggesting a cooperative network of interactions. A complete analysis of the thermodynamics was performed in which differences in side-chain hydrophobicity and conformational entropy between the two proteins are accounted for.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

At 300 K, the folding time is 4.3(+/-0.6) micros, making it the fastest folding, naturally occurring protein, with a rate close to the theoretical speed limit. This time is in remarkable agreement with the prediction of 5 (+11,-3) micros by Zagrovic et al. from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using an implicit solvent model. We test their prediction that replacement of the C-terminal phenylalanine residue with alanine will increase the folding rate by removing a transient non-native interaction. We find that the alanine substitution has no effect on the folding rate or on the equilibrium constant.

        "abstract": "Calmodulin, the Ca(2+)-dependent activator of many cellular processes, contains two well-defined structural domains, each of which binds two Ca(2+) ions. In its Ca(2+)-free (apo) form, it provides an attractive model for studying mechanisms of protein unfolding, exhibiting two separable, reversible processes, indicating two structurally autonomous folding units. (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR in principle offers a detailed picture of the behavior of individual residues during protein unfolding transitions, but is limited by the lack of dispersion of resonances in the unfolded state. In this work, we have used selective [(15)N]Ile labeling of four distinctive positions in each calmodulin domain to monitor the relative thermal stability of the folding units in wild-type apocalmodulin and in mutants in which either the N- or C-domain is destabilized. These mutations lead to a characteristic perturbation of the stability (T(m)) of the nonmutated domain relative to that of wild-type apocalmodulin. The ability to monitor specific (15)N-labeled residues, well-distributed throughout the domain, provides strong evidence for the autonomy of a given folding unit, as well as providing accurate measurements of the unfolding parameters T(m) and DeltaH(m). The thermodynamic parameters are interpreted in terms of interactions between one folded and one unfolded domain of apocalmodulin, where stabilization on the order of a few kilocalories per mole is sufficient to cause significant changes in the observed unfolding behavior of a given folding unit. The selective (15)N labeling approach is thus a general method that can provide detailed information about structural intermediates populated in complex protein unfolding processes.",

To determine the conformational stability of adrenodoxin, a method was found that prevents the irreversible destruction of the iron-sulfur center. The approach makes use of a buffer solution that contains sodium sulfide and mercaptoethanol. The thermal transition of adrenodoxin takes place at Ttrs = 46-57 degrees C, depending on the Na2S concentration with a denaturation enthalpy of delta H = 300-380 kJ/mol. From delta H versus Ttrs a heat capacity change was determined as delta Cp = 7.5 +/- 1.2 kJ/mol/K. The apo protein is less stable than the holo protein as judged by the lower denaturation enthalpy (delta H = 93 +/- 14 kJ/mol at Ttrs = 37.4 +/- 3.3 degrees C) and the higher proteolytic susceptibility.

        "abstract": "Phi-values, a relatively direct probe of transition-state structure, are an important benchmark in both experimental and theoretical studies of protein folding. Recently, however, significant controversy has emerged regarding the reliability with which phi-values can be determined experimentally: Because phi is a ratio of differences between experimental observables it is extremely sensitive to errors in those observations when the differences are small. Here we address this issue directly by performing blind, replicate measurements in three laboratories. By monitoring within- and between-laboratory variability, we have determined the precision with which folding rates and phi-values are measured using generally accepted laboratory practices and under conditions typical of our laboratories. We find that, unless the change in free energy associated with the probing mutation is quite large, the precision of phi-values is relatively poor when determined using rates extrapolated to the absence of denaturant. In contrast, when we employ rates estimated at nonzero denaturant concentrations or assume that the slopes of the chevron arms (mf and mu) are invariant upon mutation, the precision of our estimates of phi is significantly improved. Nevertheless, the reproducibility we thus obtain still compares poorly with the confidence intervals typically reported in the literature. This discrepancy appears to arise due to differences in how precision is calculated, the dependence of precision on the number of data points employed in defining a chevron, and interlaboratory sources of variability that may have been largely ignored in the prior literature.",

        "abstract": "Proteins meet with the stipulations of Levinthal. Two test tube variants of ferrocytochrome c (ferrocyt c) whose thermodynamic stabilities are vastly different refold to the same global minimum under a given final native condition, and they do so quickly at rates that do not reflect a strong dependence on the thermodynamic driving force. The transition-state ensemble is more unfolded-like, and the folding barrier offered is energetically sizable. The experiments involve neutral- (pH 7) and alkaline ferrocyt c pH (12.7), whose aqueous stabilities are 18 (+/-0.3) and 3 (+/-0.5) kcal mol(-)(1), respectively. But the large disparity in thermodynamic stability is not strongly reflected in their refolding rates. Cross-pH studies, where GdnHCl-unfolded states of neutral- and alkaline ferrocyt c are allowed to refold to the same final pH and denaturant concentration, indicate that the refolding rates are largely independent of the stability, configuration, ionization, and solvation of the initial unfolded state. Also, burst relaxation signals in cross-pH refolding runs show the same quantitative dependence on GdnHCl, suggesting that the earliest relaxation or reconfiguration of the chains must be the same and is independent of the initial equilibrium unfolded state. Analyses along the classical line indicate an early transition state where much less than a third of the protein surface that is buried in the native state becomes buried. The barrier energy is of the order of 10 k(B)T. The results, apparently inconsistent with the predictions of the funnel model, afford a mechanistic description of folding in which the folding time of small single-domain proteins is set by the time needed for the denatured polypeptide to search-find a nativelike topology.",

The results are compared with those obtained for a disulfide-modified analog in which the four cysteine residues have been reduced and alkylated to form tetra-S-carbamidomethylated hGH in order to elucidate the role of disulfide bonds in the folding reaction. Multiple detection techniques were applied to monitor both refolding and unfolding processes initiated by guanidine hydrochloride concentration jumps. Using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) detection to monitor folding of hGH, we find that 70% of the secondary structure forms in a burst phase occurring within the stopped-flow dead time. Two slower phases were identified in the observable portion of the CD signal. Multiple kinetic phases were resolved when folding was monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence or near-UV absorbance as probes of tertiary structure, and the number of time constants required to fit the data depended on the hGH concentration and nature of the denaturant jump. The associated amplitudes also displayed strong dependence on the final denaturant concentration. Results obtained from the tetra-S-carbamidomethylated hGH studies demonstrate that the folding reactions of hGH are remarkably similar in the presence and absence of the disulfide bonds. Disulfide bond reduction in hGH is proposed to affect folding primarily by increasing the population of self-associated intermediate states in the folding pathway.",

It was found that the DeltaG of unfolding of SBA was much higher than ConA at all the temperatures at which the experiments were done. ConA had a T(g) 18 degrees C less than SBA. The higher conformational stability of SBA in comparison to ConA is largely due to substantial differences in their degrees of subunit interactions. Ionic interactions at the interface of the two proteins especially at the noncanonical interface seem to play a significant role in the observed stability differences between these two proteins. Furthermore, SBA is a glycoprotein with a GlcNac2Man9 chain attached to Asn-75 of each subunit. The sugar chain in SBA lies at the noncanonical interface of the protein, and it is found to interact with the amino acid residues in the adjacent noncanonical interface.

        "abstract": "A comparison of the three-dimensional structures of the closely related mesophilic Clostridium beijerinckii alcohol dehydrogenase (CBADH) and the hyperthermophilic Thermoanaerobacter brockii alcohol dehydrogenase (TBADH) suggested that extra proline residues in TBADH located in strategically important positions might contribute to the extreme thermal stability of TBADH. We used site-directed mutagenesis to replace eight complementary residue positions in CBADH, one residue at a time, with proline. All eight single-proline mutants and a double-proline mutant of CBADH were enzymatically active. The critical sites for increasing thermostability parameters in CBADH were Leu-316 and Ser-24, and to a lesser degree, Ala-347. Substituting proline for His-222, Leu-275, and Thr-149, however, reduced thermal stability parameters. Our results show that the thermal stability of the mesophilic CBADH can be moderately enhanced by substituting proline at strategic positions analogous to nonconserved prolines in the homologous thermophilic TBADH. The proline residues that appear to be crucial for the increased thermal stability of CBADH are located at a beta-turn and a terminating external loop in the polypeptide chain. Positioning proline at the N-caps of alpha-helices in CBADH led to adverse effects on thermostability, whereas single-proline mutations in other positions in the polypeptide had varying effects on thermal parameters. The finding presented here support the idea that at least two of the eight extra prolines in TBADH contribute to its thermal stability.",

        "abstract": "Calcium binding to carbohydrate binding module CBM4-2 of xylanase 10A (Xyn10A) from Rhodothermus marinus was explored using calorimetry, NMR, fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy. CBM4-2 binds two calcium ions, one with moderate affinity and one with extremely high affinity. The moderate-affinity site has an association constant of (1.3 +/- 0.3) x 10(5) M(-1) and a binding enthalpy DeltaH(a) of -9.3 +/- 0.4 kJ x mol(-1), while the high-affinity site has an association constant of approximately 10(10) M(-1) and a binding enthalpy DeltaH(a) of -40.5 +/- 0.5 kJ x mol(-1). The locations of the binding sites have been identified by NMR and structural homology, and were verified by site-directed mutagenesis. The high-affinity site consists of the side chains of E11 and D160 and backbone carbonyls of E52 and K55, while the moderate-affinity site comprises the side chain of D29 and backbone carbonyls of L21, A22, V25, and W28. The high-affinity site is in a position analogous to the calcium site in CBM4 structures and in a recent CBM22 structure. Binding of calcium increases the unfolding temperature of the protein (T(m)) by approximately 23 degrees C at pH 7.5. No correlation between binding affinity and T(m) change was noted, as each of the two calcium ions contributes almost equally to the increase in unfolding temperature.",

Linear relations between [urea] and the activation energy (delta G not equal to) of the relaxation for all the Mbs showed that the slope m not equal to urea (= delta(delta G not equal to)/delta[urea])) was altered by either reduction of pH or the L-->A mutations. Thermodynamic interpretations of the changes in m not equal to urea led to a conclusion that the exposed surface area of Mb in the transition state was determined by both protein-core stability and pH conditions.

The activity of Gln38Ala is lowered by one order of magnitude, which confirms the involvement of this residue in substrate binding. In contrast, Glu41Lys had no effect on the ribonuclease Sa activity. This is surprising, because the hydrogen bond between the guanosine N1 atom and the side chain of Glu 41 is thought to be important for the guanine specificity in related ribonucleases. The activities of Glu54Gln and Arg65Ala are both lowered about 1000-fold, and His85Gln is totally inactive, confirming the importance of these residues to the catalytic function of ribonuclease Sa. In Glu74Lys, k(cat) is reduced sixfold despite the fact that Glu 74 is over 15 A from the active site. The pH dependence of k(cat)/K(M) is very similar for Glu74Lys and wild-type RNase Sa, suggesting that this is not due to a change in the pK values of the groups involved in catalysis. Compared to wild-type RNase Sa, the stabilities of Gln38Ala and Glu74Lys are increased, the stabilities of Glu41Lys, Glu54Gln, and Arg65Ala are decreased and the stability of His85Gln is unchanged. Thus, the active site residues in the ribonuclease Sa make different contributions to the stability.",

        "abstract": "Many experimental and theoretical studies have suggested a significant role for nonnative interactions in protein folding pathways, but the energetic contributions of these interactions are not well understood. We have addressed the energetics and the position specificity of nonnative hydrophobic interactions by developing a continuum coarse-grained chain model with a native-centric potential augmented by sequence-dependent hydrophobic interactions. By modeling the effect of different hydrophobicity values at various positions in the Fyn SH3 domain, we predicted energetically significant nonnative interactions that led to acceleration or deceleration of the folding rate depending on whether they were more populated in the transition state or unfolded state. These nonnative contacts were centered on position 53 in the Fyn SH3 domain, which lies in an exposed position in a 3(10)-helix. The energetic importance of the predicted nonnative interactions was confirmed experimentally by folding kinetics studies combined with double mutant thermodynamic cycles. By attaining agreement of theoretical and experimental investigations, this study provides a compelling demonstration that specific nonnative interactions can significantly influence folding energetics. Moreover, we show that a coarse-grained model with a simple consideration of hydrophobicity is sufficient for the accurate prediction of kinetically important nonnative interactions.",

        "abstract": "Well-defined, non-native protein structures of low stability have been increasingly observed as intermediates in protein folding or as equilibrium structures populated under specific solvent conditions. These intermediate structures, frequently referred to as molten globule states, are characterized by the presence of secondary structure, a lack of significant tertiary contacts, increased hydrophobicity and partial specific volume as compared to native structures, and low cooperativity in thermal unfolding. The present study demonstrates that under acidic conditions (pH less than 3) the antibody MAK33 can assume a folded stable conformation. This A-state is characterized by a high degree of secondary structure, increased hydrophobicity, a native-like maximum wavelength of fluorescence emission, and a tendency toward slow aggregation. A prominent feature of this low-pH conformation is the stability against denaturant and thermal unfolding that is manifested in highly cooperative reversible phase transitions indicative of the existence of well-defined tertiary contacts. These thermodynamic results are corroborated by the kinetics of folding from the completely unfolded chain to the alternatively folded state at pH 2. The given data suggest that MAK33 at pH 2 adopts a cooperative structure that differs from the native immunoglobulin fold at pH 7. This alternatively folded state exhibits certain characteristics of the molten globule but differs distinctly from it by its extraordinary structural stability that is characteristic for native protein structures.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium and kinetic behavior of the guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) induced unfolding/refolding of four bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) mutants was examined by using ultraviolet difference spectroscopy. In three of the mutants, we replaced the buried 30-51 disulfide bond with alanine at position 51 and valine (Val30/Ala51), alanine (Ala30/Ala51), or threonine (Thr30/Ala51) at position 30. For the fourth mutant, the solvent-exposed 14-38 disulfide was substituted by a pair of alanines (Ala14/Ala38). All mutants retained the 5-55 disulfide. Experiments were performed under oxidizing conditions; thus, both the unfolded and folded forms retained two native disulfide bonds. Equilibrium experiments demonstrated that all four mutants were destabilized relative to wild-type BPTI. However, the stability of the 30-51 mutants increased with the hydrophobicity of the residue substituted at position 30. Kinetic experiments showed that all four mutants contained two minor slow refolding phases with characteristics of proline isomerization. The specific behavior of the phases depended on the location of the disulfide bonds. The major unfolding/refolding phase for each of the 30-51 mutants was more than an order of magnitude slower than for Ala14/Ala38 or for BPTI in which the 14-38 disulfide bond was specifically reduced and blocked with iodoacetamide [Jullien, M., & Baldwin, R. L. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 145, 265-280]. Since this effect is independent of the stability of the protein, it is consistent with a model in which the proper docking of the interior residues of the protein is the rate-limiting step in the folding of these mutants.",

In this study, the parameters describing the denaturation thermodynamics of residues 6-85 of the N-terminal domain of lambda repressor have been determined by fitting the three-dimensional thermal-urea denaturation surface obtained by circular dichroism. The shape of the surface shows cold denaturation at low temperatures and urea concentrations above 2 M, which allows accurate determination of the apparent heat capacity of denaturation (delta Cp). Denaturation curves based on aromatic 1H NMR spectra give identical denaturation curves, confirming purely twostate folding under all conditions studies. The denaturation surface can be fit with constant delta Cp and delta In KD/delta[urea] (KD is the equilibrium constant for denaturation), consistent with a thermodynamically invariant denatured state. In addition, the aromatic 1H NMR spectrum of the cold denatured state at 0 degree C in 3 M uea is essentially identical to the spectrum at 70 degree C in 3 M urea. These observations indicate that the structures of the cold and heat denatured states, in the presence of 3 M urea, are thermodynamically and conformationally equivalent.",

        "abstract": "By using tryptophan scanning mutagenesis, we observed the kinetics and structure of the polymerization of tau into paired helical filaments (PHFs) independently of exogenous reporter dyes. The fluorescence exhibits pronounced blue shifts due to burial of the residue inside PHFs, depending on Trp position. The effect is greatest near the center of the repeat domain, showing that the packing is tightest near the beta-structure inducing hexapeptide motifs. The tryptophan response allows measurement of PHF stability made by different tau isoforms and mutants. Unexpectedly, the stability of PHFs is quite low (denaturation half-points approximately 1.0 m GdnHCl), implying that incipient aggregation should be reversible and that the observed high stability of Alzheimer PHFs is due to other factors. The stability increases with the number of repeats and with tau mutants promoting beta-structure, arguing for a gain of toxic function in frontotemporal dementias. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to analyze the distances of Tyr(310) to tryptophans in different positions. The degree of FRET in the soluble protein was position-dependent, with highest signals within the second and third repeats but low or no signals further away. In PHFs most mutants showed FRET, indicating that tight packing results from assembly of tau into PHFs.",

The conformational stability and the rates of folding and unfolding have been determined for a number of mutants of AcP in order to characterize the structure of the folding transition state. The results show that the transition state is an expanded version of the native protein, where most of the native interactions are partially established. The transition state of AcP turns out to be remarkably similar in structure to that of the activation domain of procarboxypeptidase A2 (ADA2h), a protein having the same overall topology but sharing only 13% sequence identity with AcP. This suggests that transition states are conserved between proteins with the same native fold. Comparison of the rates of folding of AcP and four other proteins with the same topology, including ADA2h, supports the concept that the average distance in sequence between interacting residues (that is, the contact order) is an important determinant of the rate of protein folding.",

        "abstract": "Binding of insulin to the insulin receptor plays a central role in the hormonal control of metabolism. Here, we investigate possible contact sites between the receptor and the conserved non-polar surface of the B-chain. Evidence is presented that two contiguous sites in an alpha-helix, Val(B12) and Tyr(B16), contact the receptor. Chemical synthesis is exploited to obtain non-standard substitutions in an engineered monomer (DKP-insulin). Substitution of Tyr(B16) by an isosteric photo-activatable derivative (para-azido-phenylalanine) enables efficient cross-linking to the receptor. Such cross-linking is specific and maps to the L1 beta-helix of the alpha-subunit. Because substitution of Val(B12) by larger side-chains markedly impairs receptor binding, cross-linking studies at B12 were not undertaken. Structure-function relationships are instead probed by side-chains of similar or smaller volume: respective substitution of Val(B12) by alanine, threonine, and alpha-aminobutyric acid leads to activities of 1(+/-0.1)%, 13(+/-6)%, and 14(+/-5)% (relative to DKP-insulin) without disproportionate changes in negative cooperativity. NMR structures are essentially identical with native insulin. The absence of transmitted structural changes suggests that the low activities of B12 analogues reflect local perturbation of a \"high-affinity\" hormone-receptor contact. By contrast, because position B16 tolerates alanine substitution (relative activity 34(+/-10)%), the contribution of this neighboring interaction is smaller. Together, our results support a model in which the B-chain alpha-helix, functioning as an essential recognition element, docks against the L1 beta-helix of the insulin receptor.",

Because packing density in the protein interior is similar to that observed in organic crystals, we hypothesized that changes in protein dynamics resulting in increased rigidity of the protein structure might contribute to the observed heat capacity change upon unfolding. Using differential scanning calorimetry we characterized the thermodynamic behavior of a serine protease inhibitor eglin C and two eglin C variants with altered native state dynamics, as determined by NMR.

At 25 degrees C, its highly structured form predominates (Keq = 5.7; delta G degree = -4.3 kJ X mol-1); as deduced from both 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, this conformation is exceedingly similar to those of its Mg(II)-, Ca(II)-, and Lu(III)-bound forms. The temperature dependences of several well-resolved aromatic and upfield-shifted methyl 1H NMR resonances and several CD bands indicate that the native, highly helical structure of rat apo-alpha-parvalbumin is unfolded by a concerted mechanism, showing no indication of partially structured intermediates. The melting temperature, TM, of rat apo-alpha-parvalbumin is 35 +/- 0.5 degrees C as calculated by both spectroscopic techniques. By 45 degrees C, rat apo-alpha-parvalbumin unfolds entirely, losing the tertiary structure that characterizes its folded form: not only are the ring-current-shifted aromatic and methyl 1H NMR resonances leveled, but the 262- and 269-nm CD bands are also severely reduced. As judged by the decrease in the negative ellipticity of the 222-nm CD band, this less-structured form of rat apo-alpha-parvalbumin shows an approximate 50% loss in apparent alpha-helical content compared to its folded state. Several changes in the 1H NMR spectrum of rat apo-alpha-parvalbumin were exceptionally informative probes of the specific conformational changes that accompany metal ion binding and metal ion exchange. In particular, the line intensities of the ortho proton resonance of Phe-47, the unassigned downfield-shifted alpha-CH resonances from the beta-sheet contacts between the metal-binding loops, the C2H resonance of His-48, and the epsilon-CH3 resonance of an unassigned Met residue were monitored as a function of added metal to determine the stability constants of several metal ion-parvalbumin complexes. We conclude that Mg(II) binds to the CD and EF sites independently, its affinity for the EF site being almost twice that for the CD site. Mg(II)----Ca(II) exchange showed that the CD-site Mg(II) is displaced first, in contrast to Lu(III)'s preferential displacement of the EF-site Ca(II) as determined from the Ca(II)----Lu(III) exchange experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "(Un)folding transition states of Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-ferri- and ferrocytochromes c were studied using equilibrium and kinetic denaturation experiments. The wild-type protein and the global suppressor variant, N52I (isoleucine replaces asparagine 52), were examined. Denaturation was induced by guanidinium chloride (GdmCI) and monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry without stopped-flow devices. Soret CD spectra indicate that thermal and GdmCl denatured states are different, and heat is the more effective denaturant. Equilibrium data show that the high stability of ferrocytochrome c can be rationalized as a requirement to bury the oxidation-induced positive charge and remain folded under physiological conditions. Kinetic data are monoexponential and permit characterization of the rate-limiting transition state for unfolding as a function of [GdmCl]. For the oxidized wild-type protein, the transition state solvent accessibility is nearly the same as that of the denatured state. Three perturbations, reducing the wild-type protein, reducing the N52I variant, and substituting position 52 in the oxidized protein, change the free energy and solvent accessibility of the transition state. In contrast, substituting position 52 in the reduced protein apparently does not change the transition state solvent accessibility, allowing more detailed characterization. In the reduced proteins' transition states at 4.3 M GdmCl, the position 52 side chain is in a denatured environment, even though transition state solvent accessibility is only one-third that of the denatured state (relative to the native state).",

        "abstract": "Certain types of human light chains have the propensity to deposit pathologically as amyloid fibrils as evidenced by the preferential association of monoclonal lambda 6 proteins with AL amyloidosis. However, the molecular features that render such proteins amyloidogenic have not been elucidated. Based upon the demonstrated relationship between the thermodynamic stability of light chains and their propensity to aggregate in vitro, we have initiated studies where the thermodynamic properties and fibrillogenic potential of two recombinant (r) V lambda 6 molecules were compared. The first protein was generated from cDNA cloned from marrow-derived plasma cells from a patient (Wil) who had AL amyloidosis and renal amyloid deposits; the second was from a patient (Jto) with multiple myeloma in whom the lambda 6 protein was deposited not as amyloid but in the form of renal tubular casts. The thermodynamic stabilities of rV lambda 6Wil and -Jto were determined from chaotropic and thermal denaturation studies. Based upon the Delta GH2O, Delta H, Delta G25 degrees C, Tm, and Cm values, the rV lambda 6Wil was less stable than its nonamyloidogenic counterpart, rV lambda 6Jto. Measurement of fibril formation using a novel in vitro fibril forming assay demonstrated that although both rV lambda 6 proteins formed fibrils in vitro, Wil had a shorter lag time and exhibited faster kinetics under physiologic conditions. Comparative amino acid sequence analyses of these two components and other lambda 6 amyloid-associated light chains revealed that the Jto protein had certain primary structural features that we posit contributed to its increased stability and thus rendered this protein nonamyloidogenic. Our studies provide the first evidence that stabilizing interactions within the V L domain can influence the kinetics of light chain fibrillogenicity.",

The surfaces are generated from multiple excess heat capacity profiles (<delta Cp> vs T) obtained at varying concentrations of an interacting ligand. The energetics of both the intrinsic protein stability and the protein-ligand interaction are simultaneously resolved by employing statistical thermodynamic models in global linkage analysis. This formalism allows resolution of the intrinsic protein folding-unfolding parameters (enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity changes) as well as the ligand interaction parameters (binding stoichiometry, enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity changes). The theory has been applied to the case of ribonuclease A and its interaction with cytidine-2'-monophosphate.

        "abstract": "To understand the roles of individual amino acids in the folding and stability of globular proteins, a systematic structural analysis of mutants of the lysozyme of bacteriophage T4 has been undertaken. The isolation, characterization, crystallographic refinement and structural analysis of a temperature-sensitive lysozyme in which threonine 157 is replaced by isoleucine is reported here. This mutation reduces the temperature of the midpoint of the reversible thermal denaturation transition by 11 deg.C at pH 2.0. Electron density maps showing differences between the wild-type and mutant X-ray crystal structures have obvious features corresponding to the substitution of threonine 157 by isoleucine. There is little difference electron density in the remainder of the molecule, indicating that the structural changes are localized to the site of the mutation. High-resolution crystallographic refinement of the mutant lysozyme structure confirms that it is very similar to wild-type lysozyme. The largest conformational differences are in the gamma-carbon of residue 157 and in the side-chain of Asp159, which shift 1.0 A and 1.1 A, respectively. In the wild-type enzyme, the gamma-hydroxyl group of Thr157 participates in a network of hydrogen bonds. Substitution of Thr157 with an isoleucine disrupts this set of hydrogen bonds. A water molecule bound in the vicinity of Thr155 partially restores the hydrogen bond network in the mutant structure, but the buried main-chain amide of Asp159 is not near a hydrogen bond acceptor. This unsatisfied hydrogen-bonding potential is the most obvious reason for the reduction in stability of the temperature-sensitive mutant protein.",

        "abstract": "Specific residues in a polypeptide may be key contributors to the stability and foldability of the unique native structure. Identification and prediction of such residues is, therefore, an important area of investigation in solving the protein folding problem. Atypical main-chain conformations can help identify strains within a folded protein, and by inference, positions where unique amino acids may have a naturally high frequency of occurrence due to favorable contributions to stability and folding. Non-Gly residues located near the left-handed alpha-helical region (L-alpha) of the Ramachandran plot are a potential indicator of structural strain. Although many investigators have studied mutations at such positions, no consistent energetic or kinetic contributions to stability or folding have been elucidated. Here we report a study of the effects of Gly, Ala and Asn substitutions found within the L-alpha region at a characteristic position in defined beta-hairpin turns within human acidic fibroblast growth factor, and demonstrate consistent effects upon stability and folding kinetics. The thermodynamic and kinetic data are compared to available data for similar mutations in other proteins, with excellent agreement. The results have identified that Gly at the i+3 position within a subset of beta-hairpin turns is a key contributor towards increasing the rate of folding to the native state of the polypeptide while leaving the rate of unfolding largely unchanged.",

        "abstract": "Sac7d is a chromatin protein from the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius that severely kinks duplex DNA with negligible change in protein structure. In previous work, the overall stability of Sac7d has been well-characterized with a global analysis of the linkage of folding, protonation, and anion binding. We extend that work here with NMR measurements of global stability as well as the distribution of stability and flexibility in the solution structure. Native state amide hydrogen exchange has been used to identify the most-protected core amide protons which exchange through global unfolding. The pH and temperature dependence of stability defined by native state exchange is in excellent agreement with the free energy surface determined by a linkage analysis of the dependence of folding on pH, salt, and temperature. These results confirm that the deltaC(P) obtained from a Kirchhoff analysis of DSC data (i.e., deltaH vs Tm) is incorrect, and an accurate description of the protein stability curve for Sac7d requires a measure of the thermodynamic contributions of protonation and anion binding. Amide hydrogen exchange, along with generalized order parameters determined by 15N relaxation data, demonstrates considerable variation in stability throughout the structure with some of the least stable regions occurring at the N- and C-termini. The most stable and inflexible region of the backbone occurs primarily in the DNA-binding beta-sheet which is responsible for bending DNA.",

        "abstract": "The conformational stability of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) from Escherichia coli has been determined using a combination of thermal unfolding and urea denaturation experiments. The analysis of the denaturation data provides a measure of the changes in conformational free energy, enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity that accompany the equilibrium folding of HPr over a wide range of temperature and urea concentrations. In moderate concentrations of urea, HPr undergoes both high- and low-temperature unfolding, allowing for a reliable determination of the change in heat capacity for the conformational transition. The data are consistent with the linear free energy relationship commonly employed to analyze protein denaturation data, even over a relatively large temperature and urea concentration range. Furthermore, we find that a temperature-independent delta Cp is adequate to describe HPr stability over the accessible temperature range. Finally, our data allow us to evaluate the energetics of the urea-protein interaction. For HPr, the changes in excess enthalpy and entropy of the denaturant-protein interaction(s) make only minor contributions to the observed delta H and delta S terms, presumably due in some part to the small size of the HPr protein.",

Optical spectroscopy indicates that, at pH 7.2, Thr-71 iso-2-cytochrome c folds to a nonnative conformation possibly related to the alkaline form of the native protein. On titration to pH 5.2, Thr-71 iso-2-cytochrome c regains many of the optical properties of the normal protein. We have shown that the proline residue at position 71 has no effect on the kinetics of fluorescence-detected slow refolding. However, between pH 5 and pH 7.2 the amplitude for absorbance-detected slow folding is strongly pH dependent in the mutant protein but is largely independent of pH in the normal protein. We believe this to be due to the folding of Thr-71 iso-2-cytochrome c to a nonnative conformation at pH 7.2 that does not require the slow, absorbance-detected conformational changes observed in folding to the more native-like state at pH 5-6.",

Replacement of Pro-117 with Gly or Thr caused small increases in stability, whereas substitution of Pro-31 by Ala led to a small decrease in stability. The slopes of the plots of delta G against denaturant concentration (m) for the mutant proteins are significantly smaller than for the wild-type, suggesting a decrease in the solvent-accessible surface area of the denatured state relative to that of the wild-type. The rates of unfolding and refolding were monitored using tryptophan fluorescence. The kinetic traces for refolding in the presence of Gdn-SCN were triphasic for the wild-type protein and P31A but biphasic for P117G and P117T mutants. The slower phases were typically 10% of the total amplitude except in the transition region. The rates of the fastest and medium phases of the wild-type were essentially unaffected by the mutations. Double-jump experiments in which the protein was unfolded in a high concentration of denaturant for a short time period and then refolded to final Gdn-SCN concentrations near the Cm revealed a fast increase in fluorescence emission corresponding to formation of the native state, followed by a slower decrease with an amplitude that varied with the guanidine concentration and time of unfolding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Unlike wild-type RNase A, the G88R variant is toxic to cancer cells. Here, variants in which disulfide bonds were removed from or added to G88R RNase A were used to probe the relationship between conformational stability and cytotoxicity in a methodical manner. The conformational stability of the C40A/G88R/C95A and C65A/C72A/G88R variants is less than that of G88R RNase A. In contrast, a new disulfide bond that links the N and C termini (residues 4 and 118) increases the conformational stability of G88R RNase A and C65A/C72A/G88R RNase A. These changes have little effect on the ribonucleolytic activity of the enzyme or on its ability to evade the cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor protein. The changes do, however, have a substantial effect on toxicity toward human erythroleukemia cells. Specifically, conformational stability correlates directly with cytotoxicity as well as with resistance to proteolysis. These data indicate that conformational stability is a key determinant of RNase A cytotoxicity and suggest that cytotoxicity relies on avoiding proteolysis. This finding suggests a means to produce new cancer chemotherapeutic agents based on mammalian ribonucleases.",

        "abstract": "The conformational stabilities of full-length colicin B and its isolated C-terminal domain were studied by guanidine hydrochloride induced unfolding. The unfolding/refolding was monitored by far-UV CD and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopies. At pH 7.4, the disruption of the secondary structure of full-length colicin B is monophasic, while changes in tertiary structure occur in two separate transitions. The intermediate species, which is well-populated around 2.2 M guanidine hydrochloride, exhibits secondary and tertiary structures distinct from both native and unfolded states. Whereas the domain structure of native full-length colicin B is reflected in its DSC profile, the folding intermediate of the same protein exhibits a single unresolved peak. These observations have led us to propose an unfolding model for full-length colicin B where the first transition between 0 and 2.5 M GuHCl with an associated free energy of 3 kcal/mol correlates with the partial unfolding of the R/T domain. The stability of full-length colicin B is weakened due to the presence of the R/T domain in both the native [Ortega, A., Lambotte, S., and Bechinger, B. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276 (17), 13563-13572] and the intermediate states. The second transition between 2.5 and 5 M GuHCl involves unfolding of the C-terminal domain (Delta = 7 kcal/mol). The isolated colicin B C-terminal domain consists of two subdomains, and the two parts of this protein fragment unfold sequentially through the formation of at least one intermediate. The significance of these results for membrane insertion of colicin B is discussed.",

The results obtained by guanidinium chloride denaturation of the azurin mutant C112S from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the temperature range from -8 to -16 degrees C, demonstrate that the stability of the native fold may be significantly perturbed in ice depending mainly on the size of the liquid water pool (V(L)) in equilibrium with the solid phase. The data establish a threshold, around V(L)=1.5%, below which in ice DeltaG degrees decreases progressively relative to liquid state, up to 3 kcal/mole for V(L)=0.285%. The sharp dependence of DeltaG degrees on V(L) is consistent with a mechanism based on adsorption of the protein to the ice surface. The reduction in DeltaG degrees is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in m-value indicating that protein-ice interactions increase the solvent accessible surface area of the native fold or reduce that of the denatured state, or both. The method opens the possibility for examining in a more quantitative fashion the influence of various experimental conditions on the ice perturbation and in particular to test the effectiveness of numerous additives used in formulations to preserve labile pharmaco proteins.",

In the present work we examine the unfolding of a series of alpha-helical amphipathic membrane-associated peptides using guanidine hydrochloride as a denaturant. The peptides are based on the class A amphipathic helix motif, and each contains a single tryptophan at sequence position 2, 3, 7, 12, or 14. The isothermal unfolding process was monitored by circular dichroism ellipticity at 222 nm to monitor changes in the helical structure of the peptide. Tryptophan fluorescence was used to probe the local changes in the environment about the indole fluorophore. The unfolding curves generated from the two experimental techniques for each peptide-lipid complex were non-coincidental, suggesting the presence of stable intermediate(s) in the unfolding. A three-state model could adequately account for the data and yielded parameters which were consistent with the presence of a partially folded intermediate structure which (i) is closer in Gibb's free energy to the folded state than the unfolded state and (ii) retains much of the interfacial and amphipathic character of the folded state. Denaturant-induced peptide dissociation from the peptide-lipid complexes was found to be negligible as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography.

        "abstract": "The equilibrium denaturation of an Escherichia coli-derived recombinant murine interleukin-6 (mIL-6) was studied using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The urea-induced unfolding of mIL-6 at pH 4.0 can be described by a two-state unfolding mechanism based on the superimposibility of the CD and fluorescence unfolding transitions. Assuming a two-state mechanism and a linear dependence of the free energy of unfolding on denaturant concentration, a value of 6.9-9.0 kcal/mol was calculated for the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant [delta GU(H2O)]. However, when GuHCl was used as a denaturant at pH 4.0, a biphasic unfolding transition was observed. This unfolding transition has a distinct midpoint occurring at 2.5 M GuHCl, which is indicative of the formation of stable folding intermediates. Similar intermediate folded species were also observed at pH 7.4 when either urea or GuHCl were used as denaturants. The intermediate folded states of mIL-6 exhibited a tendency to aggregate, as judged by the concentration dependence of their fluorescence characteristics. The fluorescence emission maximum of mIL-6 at pH 7.4 in the presence of 1.5 M GuHCl, for example, was blue-shifted from 343 nm at a protein concentration of 50 micrograms/mL to 336 nm at 500 micrograms/mL. Intermediate formation at pH 4.0, using 10 mM sodium acetate buffer and urea as the denaturant, was facilitated by the addition of 0.4 and 0.8 M salt, where the salt was either NaCl or GuHCl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Significant stabilization of a protein often occurs when it is assembled into an oligomer. Bacteriophage P22 contains 420 monomers of coat protein that are stabilized by the assembly and maturation processes. The effects of eight single amino acid substitutions in coat protein that each cause a temperature-sensitive-folding defect were investigated to determine if the conformational differences previously observed in the monomers could be alleviated by assembly or maturation. Several techniques including differential scanning calorimetry, heat-induced expansion, urea denaturation, and sensitivity to protease digestion were used to explore the effects of the amino acid substitutions on the conformation of coat protein, once assembled. Each of the amino acid substitutions caused a change in the conformation as compared to wild-type coat protein, observed by at least one of the probes used. Thus, neither assembly nor expansion entirely corrected the conformational defects in the monomeric subunits of the folding mutants.",

        "abstract": "The 142 amino acid Dim1p protein is a component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex required for pre-mRNA splicing and interacts with multiple splicing-associated proteins. To gain further insight into the structural basis of its function, we determined the solution structure of the reduced form of the dominant negative human hDim1 (hDim1(1)(-)(128)) using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. This dominant negative hDim1 assumes a thioredoxin-like fold, confirming previous NMR and crystallographic results. However, in contrast to a recent crystal structure, the NMR solution structure for the reduced form of hDim1(1)(-)(128) presented here, along with thermodynamic data, indicates that the presence of a disulfide bond between Cys38 and Cys79 is structurally and functionally unimportant. Comparison of the truncated hDim1(1)(-)(128) with the full-length protein, using NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy, indicates that the 14 C-terminal residues can undergo a local unfolding transition and assume alternative conformations, which appear to play a functional role. Other residues essential for hDim1 function are identified by using mutational and genetic approaches. The residues thus identified are not identical with those previously shown to govern Dim1 interaction with defined protein partners.",

        "abstract": "Scanning microcalorimetry and spectrofluorimetry were applied to a study of the thermal stability and interaction of the modules within natural human protein C (PC) and recombinant protein C (rPC), a potential therapeutic anticoagulant expressed in transgenic pigs. Upon heating in the presence of 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.5, each protein exhibited a similar heat absorption peak with a Tm of approximately 62 degrees C corresponding to the melting of the serine protease (SP) module. Deconvolution of this peak indicated that the SP module consists of two domains that unfold independently. At pH below 3.8, a second peak appeared at extremely high temperature corresponding to the unfolding of the two interacting epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains. This second peak occurred at a temperature about 20 degrees C lower in rPC than in PC indicating that the EGF domains in the recombinant protein are less stable. The isolated 6-kDa gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) fragment as well as a 25-kDa Gla-(EGF)2 fragment both exhibited a sigmoidal fluorescence-detected denaturation transition in the same temperature region as the SP domains, but only in the presence of Ca2+. In 2 mM Ca2+, the first heat absorption peak in both intact proteins became biphasic, indicating Ca(2+)-induced structural changes. By contrast, Ca2+ had very little effect on the melting of Gla-domain-less protein C. This indicates that not Ca2+ itself but the Ca(2+)-loaded Gla domain is responsible for conformational changes in the SP domain of the parent protein. Detailed analysis of the shape of the endotherms obtained in Ca2+ and EDTA suggests that Ca2+ induces compact structure in the Gla domain which appears to interact strongly with the SP domain(s) of protein C.",

        "title": "Contributions of engineered surface salt bridges to the stability of T4 lysozyme determined by directed mutagenesis.", 
        "abstract": "Six designed mutants of T4 lysozyme were created in an attempt to create putative salt bridges on the surface of the protein. The first three of the mutants, T115E (Thr 115 to Glu), Q123E, and N144E, were designed to introduce a new charged side chain close to one or more existing charged groups of the opposite sign on the surface of the protein. In each of these cases the putative electrostatic interactions introduced by the mutation include possible salt bridges between residues within consecutive turns of an alpha-helix. Effects of the mutations ranged from no change in stability to a 1.5 degrees C (0.5 kcal/mol) increase in melting temperature. In two cases, secondary (double) mutants were constructed as controls in which the charge partner was removed from the primary mutant structure. These controls proteins indicate that the contributions to stability from each of the engineered salt bridges is very small (about 0.1-0.25 kcal/mol in 0.15 M KCl). The structures of the three primary mutants were determined by X-ray crystallography and shown to be essentially the same as the wild-type structure except at the site of the mutation. Although the introduced charges in the T115E and Q123E structures are within 3-5 A of their intended partner, the introduced side chains and their intended partners were observed to be quite mobile. It has been shown that the salt bridge between His 31 and Asp 70 in T4 lysozyme stabilizes the protein by 3-5 kcal/mol [Anderson, D. E., Becktel, W. J., & Dahlquist, F. W. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 2403-2408]. To test the effectiveness of His...Asp interactions in general, three additional double mutants, K60H/L13D, K83H/A112D, and S90H/Q122D, were created in order to introduce histidine-aspartate charge pairs on the surface of the protein. Each of these mutants destabilizes the protein by 1-3 kcal/mol in 0.15 M KCl at pH values from 2 to 6.5. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the mutant K83H/A112D has been determined and shows that there are backbone conformational changes of 0.3-0.6 A extending over several residues. The introduction of the histidine and aspartate presumably introduces strain into the folded protein that destabilizes this variant. It is concluded that pairs of oppositely charged residues that are on the surface of a protein and have freedom to adopt different conformations do not tend to come together to form structurally localized salt bridges. Rather, such residues tend to remain mobile, interact weakly if at all, and do not contribute significantly to protein stability. It is argued that the entropic cost of localizing a pair of solvent-exposed charged groups on the surface of a protein largely offsets the interaction energy expected from the formation of a defined salt bridge. There are examples of strong salt bridges in proteins, but such interactions require that the folding of the protein provides the requisite driving energy to hold the interacting partners in the correct rigid alignment.",

        "abstract": "Pro78 is a solvent-exposed residue at the N-terminal end of alpha-helix 5 in the DNA binding domain of lambda repressor. Random mutagenesis experiments have suggested that Pro78 is essential [Reidhaar-Olson, J.F., & Sauer, R.T. (1990) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. (in press)]. To investigate the requirement for proline at this position, we constructed and studied the properties of a set of ten position 78 mutant proteins. All of these mutants have decreased intracellular activities and are expressed at significantly lower levels than wild type. Pulse-chase experiments show that the mutant proteins are rapidly degraded in the cell; the mutants examined had half-lives of 11-35 min, whereas the wild-type protein has a half-life of greater than 10 h. The rapid degradation of position 78 mutants is not suppressed by mutations that affect known Escherichia coli proteases. The Pro78----Ala mutant could be overexpressed in a dnaJ- strain and was purified. This mutant has full DNA binding activity in vitro, suggesting that its folded structure and ability to form active dimers are similar to those of wild type. The PA78 mutant (Tm = 48 degrees C) is less thermally stable than wild type (Tm = 55 degrees C). Double-mutant studies show that this instability contributes to but is not the main cause of its rapid intracellular degradation and also suggest that proteolysis proceeds from the denatured forms of proteins containing the PA78 substitution. The PA78 mutation does not appear to introduce a new cleavage site for cellular proteases, nor does the mutation enhance susceptibility to proteases such as thermolysin and trypsin in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "A series of single and double amino acid replacements in four beta strands of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium, and alpha/beta barrel protein, was made to study the interior packing of the barrel and to clarify its folding mechanism. The urea-induced unfolding of the alpha subunit is thought to involve a stable intermediate in which the amino folding unit (residues 1-188; helices 0-5, strands 1-6) remains folded while the carboxy folding unit (residues 189-268; helices 6-8, strands 7-8) becomes disordered [Beasty, A. M., & Matthews, C. R. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3547; Miles, E. W., Yutani, K., & Ogasahara, K. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 2586]. Mutations in strands 1 (A18G and A18V), 6 (Y175Q), 7 (L209V), and 8 (G230A, G230V, and I232V) at the interface between these two folding units show that the effects on the stabilities of the native and intermediate conformations critically depend on the site of the replacement. Although all of these mutations decrease the stability of the native conformation, only the replacements in strand 6, Y175Q, and possibly strand 8, I232V, also perturb the intermediate. Comparisons of the effects of three pairs of double mutants with the effects of the constituent single mutants on stability show that strands 6 and 7 interact in both the intermediate and native conformations, while strands 1 and 8 interact only in the native conformation. Kinetic studies of unfolding indicate that the interactions which occur in the native conformation arise in the preceding transition state. These results demonstrate that the carboxy folding unit adopts an organized structure in the intermediate, contrary to our previous interpretation. The general implication is that the state of folding of one segment of a protein can depend on the presence of another, more stable element of structure.",

Changes in GCN4 sequence have been engineered that introduce trial patterns of single and multiple salt bridges at solvent exposed sites. At the same sites, a set of alanine mutants was generated to provide a reference for thermodynamic analysis of the salt bridges. Introduction of three alanines stabilizes the dimer by 1.1 kcal/mol relative to the wild-type. An arrangement corresponding to a complex type of salt bridge involving three groups stabilizes the dimer by 1.7 kcal/ mol, an apparent elevation of the melting temperature relative to wild type of about 22 degrees C. While identifying local from nonlocal contributions to protein stability is difficult, stabilizing interactions can be identified by use of cycles. Introduction of alanines for side chains of lower helix propensity and complex salt bridges both stabilize the coiled-coil, so that combining the two should yield melting temperatures substantially higher than the starting species, approaching those of thermophilic sequences.",

        "abstract": "Efforts to enhance the stability of proteins by introducing engineered disulfide bonds have resulted in mixed success. Most approaches to the prediction of the energetic consequences of disulfide bond formation in proteins have considered only the destabilizing effects of cross-links on the unfolded state (chain entropy model) [Pace, C. N., Grimsley, G. R., Thomson, J. A., & Barnett, B. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11820-11825: Doig, A. J., & Williams, D. H. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 217, 389-398]. It seems clear, however, that disulfide bridges also can influence the stability of the native state. In order to assess the importance of the latter effect, we have studied four variants of staphylococcal nuclease (V8 strain) each containing one potential disulfide bridge created by changing two wild-type residues to cysteines by site-directed mutagenesis. In each case, one of the introduced cysteines was within the type VIa beta turn containing cis Pro117, and the other was located in the adjacent extended loop containing Gly79. In all four cases, the overall loop size was kept nearly constant (the number of residues in the loop between the two cysteines varied from 37 to 42) so as to minimize differences from chain entropy effects. The objective was to create variants in which a change in the reduction state of the disulfide would be coupled to a change in the position of the equilibrium between the cis and trans forms of the Xxx116-Pro117 peptide bond in the folded state of the protein. The position of this equilibrium, which can be detected by NMR spectroscopy, has been shown previously to correlate with the stability of the native protein. Its determination provides a measure of strain in the folded state. The thermal stabilities and free energies for unfolding by elevated temperature and guanidinium chloride were measured for each of the four mutants under conditions in which the introduced cysteines were cross-linked (oxidized) and unlinked (reduced). In addition, reduction potentials were determined for each mutant. Formation of the different disulfide bridges was found to induce varying levels of folded state strain. The stabilization energy of a given disulfide bridge could be predicted from the measured perturbation energy for the peptide bond isomerization, provided that energetic effects on the unfolded state were calculated according to the chain entropy model. Undiagnosed strain in native states of proteins may explain the variability observed in the stabilization provided by engineered disulfide bridges.",

The thermal denaturation temperature decreased with all mutations, accompanied by a decrease in the calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation. The steady-state kinetic parameter for the enzyme reaction, Km, was only slightly influenced, but kcat was significantly decreased by the mutations, there being 3- (G121C) to 42-fold (G121L) decreases in kcat/Km compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. The effects of mutations on the stability and enzyme activity were statistically examined as a function of the hydrophobicity and volume of amino acids introduced. The diminished stability and activity with increases in the hydrophobicity and volume of amino acids suggest that the main effect of the mutations would be modification of the flexibility of the loop due to overcrowding of the bulky side chains, overcoming the enhancement of the hydrophobic interaction.",

        "abstract": "Salt bridges play important roles in the conformational stability of proteins. However, the effect of a surface salt bridge on the stability remains controversial even today; some reports have shown little contribution of a surface salt bridge to stability, whereas others have shown a favorable contribution. In this study, to elucidate the net contribution of a surface salt bridge to the conformational stability of a protein, systematic mutant human lysozymes, containing one Glu to Gln (E7Q) and five Asp to Asn mutations (D18N, D49N, D67N, D102N, and D120N) at residues where a salt bridge is formed near the surface in the wild-type structure, were examined. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation between pH 2.0 and 4.8 were determined by use of a differential scanning calorimeter, and the crystal structures were analyzed by X-ray crystallography. The denaturation Gibbs energy (DeltaG) of all mutant proteins was lower than that of the wild-type protein at pH 4, whereas there was little difference between them near pH 2. This is caused by the fact that the Glu and Asp residues are ionized at pH 4 but protonated at pH 2, indicating a favorable contribution of salt bridges to the wild-type structure at pH 4. Each contribution was not equivalent, but we found that the contributions correlate with the solvent inaccessibility of the salt bridges; the salt bridge contribution was small when 100% accessible, while it was about 9 kJ/mol if 100% inaccessible. This conclusion indicates how to reconcile a number of conflicting reports about role of surface salt bridges in protein stability. Furthermore, the effect of salts on surface salt bridges was also examined. In the presence of 0.2 M KCl, the stability at pH 4 decreased, and the differences in stability between the wild-type and mutant proteins were smaller than those in the absence of salts, indicating the compensation to the contribution of salt bridges with salts. Salt bridges with more than 50% accessibility did not contribute to the stability in the presence of 0.2 M KCl.",

Conditions have been defined for efficient reconstitution of the native, disulfide-bonded inhibitor from completely unfolded, reduced polypeptide chains. The spectral properties of the native inhibitor are consistent with previous results on the solution structure of hirudin. Extremely low circular dichroism in the far ultraviolet ([theta]Mr,220 nm = -8 +/- 1 x 10(2) deg.cm2.dmol-1) indicates a very low content of regular secondary structure. Although both tyrosine residues of the recombinant inhibitor titrate around pH 10.6, typical for solvent-exposed tyrosines, fluorescence emission and near-ultraviolet circular dichroism suggest that at least one of the tyrosines is partially shielded from solvent quench, and immobilized in an asymmetric environment. Reversible thermal unfolding of hirudin around 65 degrees C is indicated by the disappearance of its dichroic absorption in the near ultraviolet and by a fourfold increase in ellipticity at 225 nm. The transition can be approximated by a two-state model with a transition enthalpy of delta Hvan't Hoff = 159 kJ/mol and a transition entropy of 464 J.mol-1.K-1. Reduced hirudin at room temperature is largely unfolded and inactive as an inhibitor of thrombin assayed with a low-molecular-mass substrate. Refolding and reoxidation are observed at alkaline pH in the presence of a mixture of glutathione and glutathione disulfide. Spectroscopy, thrombin inhibition, and reversed-phase HPLC indicate reconstitution yields close to 100% and that the reconstituted inhibitor is identical to the native starting material.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated factors affecting stability at the subunit-subunit interface of the dimeric enzyme 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) from Bacillus subtilis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace methionine 256, a key residue in the subunit interaction, with other amino acids. Thermal stability against irreversible inactivation of the mutated enzymes was examined by analyzing the residual activity after heat treatment. The mutations M256V and M256A increased thermostability by 2.0 and 6.0 degrees C, respectively, whereas the mutations M256L and M256I had no effect. Thermostability of the M256F mutated enzyme was 4.0 degrees C lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. To our surprise, increasing the hydrophobicity of residue 256 within the hydrophobic core of the enzyme resulted in a lower thermal stability. The mutated enzymes showed an inverse correlation between thermostability and the volume of the side chain at position 256. Based on the X-ray crystallographic structure of Escherichia coli IPMDH, the environment around M256 in the B.subtilis homolog is predicted to be sterically crowded. These results suggest that Met256 prevents favorable packing. Introduction of a smaller amino acid at position 256 improves the packing and stabilizes the dimeric structure of IPMDH. The van der Waals volume of the amino acid residue at the hydrophobic subunit interface is an important factor for maintaining the stability of the subunit-subunit interface and is not always optimized in the mesophilic IPMDH enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Using a cloned single domain of the high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), we evaluated the effect of introducing metal binding site(s) on protein stability and function. An HMG domain is a conserved sequence of approximately 80 amino acids rich in basic, aromatic and proline residues that is active in binding DNA in a sequence- or structure-specific manner. The design strategy focuses on anchoring selected regions of the protein, specifically loops and turns in the molecule, using His-metal ligands. Changes in secondary structure, thermostability and DNA binding properties of a series of such mutants were evaluated. The two most stable mutant constructs contain three surface histidine replacements (two metal binding sites) in the regions encompassing both turns of the molecule. On ligation with the divalent nickel cation, the stability of these two triple histidine mutants (I38H/N51H/D55H and G39H/N51H/D55H) increases by 1.3 and 1.6 kcal/mol, respectively, relative to the wild-type protein, although the creation of binding sites per se destabilizes the protein. The DNA-binding properties of the modified proteins are not impaired by the introduction of the metal binding motifs. These results indicate that it is feasible to stabilize protein tertiary structure using appropriate placement of surface His-metal bonds without loss of function.",

        "abstract": "To expand the functionality of lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) we have used directed evolution to create CALB mutants with improved resistance towards irreversible thermal inactivation. Two mutants, 23G5 and 195F1, were generated with over a 20-fold increase in half-life at 70 degrees C compared with the wild-type CALB (WT-CALB). The increase in half-life was attributed to a lower propensity of the mutants to aggregate in the unfolded state and to an improved refolding. The first generation mutant, 23G5, obtained by error-prone PCR, had two amino acid mutations, V210I and A281E. The second generation mutant, 195F1, derived from 23G5 by error-prone PCR, had one additional mutation, V221D. Amino acid substitutions at positions 221 and 281 were determined to be critical for lipase stability, while the residue at position 210 had only a marginal effect. The catalytic efficiency of the mutants with p-nitrophenyl butyrate and 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl octanoate was also found to be superior to that of WT-CALB.",

We have used a coordinated approach, combining the known functional and structural properties of cytochromes c, to engineer mutations into yeast iso-1-cytochrome c with the goal of selectively increasing the stability of the protein. The two redox forms of the native protein and six different mutant forms of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The relative stability, expressed as the difference in the Gibb's free energy of denaturation at a given temperature between the native and mutant forms (DeltaDeltaG(Tref)), was determined for each of the proteins. In both oxidation states, the mutant proteins C102T, T69E/C102T, T96A/C102T, and T69E/T96A/C102T were more stable than the wild-type protein, respectively. The increased stability of the mutant proteins is proposed to be due to the removal of a rare surface cysteine and the stabilization of two distorted alpha-helices.",

        "abstract": "The urea-induced denaturation of dimeric Erythrina indica lectin (EIL) has been studied at pH 7.2 under equilibrium and kinetic conditions in the temperature range of 40-55 degrees C. The structure of EIL is largely unaffected in this temperature range in absence of denaturant, and also in 8 M urea after incubation for 24 h at ambient temperature. The equilibrium denaturation of EIL exhibits a monophasic unfolding transition from the native dimer to the unfolded monomer as monitored by fluorescence, far-UV CD, and size-exclusion FPLC. The thermodynamic parameters determined for the two-state unfolding equilibrium show that the free energy of unfolding (DeltaGu, aq) remains practically same between 40 and 55 degrees C, with a value of 11.8 +/- 0.6 kcal mol(-1) (monomer units). The unfolding kinetics of EIL describes a single exponential decay pattern, and the apparent rate constants determined at different temperatures indicate that the rate of the unfolding reaction increases several fold with increase in temperature. The presence of probe like external metal ions (Mn2+, Ca2+) does not influence the unfolding reaction thermodynamically or kinetically; however, the presence of EDTA affects only kinetics. The present results suggest that the ability of EIL to preserve the structural integrity against the highly denaturing conditions is linked primarily to its kinetic stability, and the synergic action of heat and denaturant is involved in the unfolding of the protein.",

        "abstract": "The rate constants for refolding and unfolding of the P22 Arc repressor dimer have been determined by stop-flow fluorescence experiments. Under most conditions, refolding is described well as a two-state reaction with a bimolecular rate-limiting step (kf approximately 10(7) M-1 s-1). A unimolecular step appears to become co-rate limiting at high protein concentrations. The urea dependence of the refolding reaction suggests that about 75% of the total burial of hydrophobic surface occurs between the unfolded state and the transition state for folding. Hydrophobic interactions are also evidenced by the temperature dependence of the refolding reaction; the rate increases with temperature and Arrhenius plots are curved, as expected for a reaction that proceeds with a significant heat capacity change. The refolding of Arc also proceeds more rapidly as the salt concentration is raised, presumably because repulsive interactions between monomers are screened. At a protein concentration of 10 microM, the apparent rate constant for refolding of the Arc dimer is approximately 100 s-1, as fast as the refolding of many monomeric proteins. The rate constant for unfolding is approximately 0.1 s-1, corresponding to a half-life of less than 10 s for the folded Arc dimer. This rate of unfolding is very fast in comparison to that of other characterized proteins and implies that a free Arc molecule must unfold and refold hundreds of times per generation in the cell.",

The transition temperature of the S100C/N148C (DS1), V98C/A152C (DS2), and A1GC/G187,C188 (cXl) in comparison to the wild type was increased by 5.0, 4.1 and 3.8 degrees C, respectively. Interestingly, a combination of two disulfide bonds of DS1 and cXl (cDS1, circular disulfide 1) led to a 12 degrees C increase in the transition temperature. Importantly, an increase in the melting point and DeltaDeltaG values of the cDS1 mutant was cooperative. These results suggest that the mechanism of stabilization by disulfide bonds under irreversible denaturation condition is achieved through: (1) a change in the rate-limiting step on the denaturation pathway; (2) destabilizing the unfolded state without affecting the relative rate constants on the denaturation pathway (like cXl mutant); and (3) or combination of the two (cDS1 mutant).",

The functional role of tyrosine phosphorylation and also the number and location of its (their) phosphorylation site(s) are yet elusive. We have used the recombinant catalytic domain of botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT E) to examine these issues. Bacterially expressed and purified BoNT E catalytic domain was fully active, and was phosphorylated in vitro by the tyrosine-specific kinase Src. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the catalytic domain increased the protein thermal stability without affecting its proteolytic activity. Covalent modification of the endopeptidase promoted a disorder-to-order transition, as evidenced by the 35% increment of the alpha-helical content, which resulted in a 4 degrees C increase of its denaturation temperature. Site-directed replacement of tyrosine at position 67 completely abolished phosphate incorporation by Src. Constitutively unphosphorylated endopeptidase mutants exhibited functional properties virtually identical to those displayed by the nonphosphorylated wild-type catalytic domain. These findings indicate the presence of a single phosphorylation site in the catalytic domain of clostridial neurotoxins, and that its covalent modification primarily modulates the protein thermostability.",

        "abstract": "Adenylate kinases (ADKs) from four closely related methanogenic members of the Archaea (the mesophile Methanococcus voltae (MVO), the thermopile Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus (MTH), and the extreme thermopiles Methanococcus igneus (MIG) and Methanococcus jannaschii (MJA)) were characterized for their resistance to thermal denaturation. Despite possessing between 68 and 81% sequence identity, the methanococcal ADKs significantly differed in their stability against thermal denaturation, with melting points ranging from 69 to 103 degrees C. The high sequence identity between these organisms allowed regions of the MVO and MJA ADKs to be exchanged, producing chimeric ADKs with significantly altered thermal stability. Up to a 20 degrees C increase or decrease in stability was achieved for chimeric ADKs, whereas 88% of the original protein sequence was maintained. Based on our previous structural modeling studies, we conclude that cooperative interactions within the hydrophobic protein core play an integral role in determining the differences in structural stability observed between the methanococcal ADKs. From comparisons of the effects of temperature on protein unfolding and optimal enzymatic activity, we also conclude that thermostability and enzymatic temperature optima are influenced differently by molecular modifications and thus that the protein flexibility required for activity and stability, respectively, is not unconditionally linked within the methanococcal ADKs.",

Recently we analyzed the results for RNase A and showed that the effects of the carbohydrates on the protein's thermal stability can be accurately accounted for by scaled particle theory (SPT), and are thus largely entropic in nature. In this paper we extend this analysis to alpha-lactalbumin and demonstrate the generality of this finding. We also investigate the relationship between SPT and the thermodynamic formalism of preferential interactions. The preferential binding parameters calculated using SPT are in excellent agreement with experimentally measured values available in the literature. This agreement is expected to hold as long as enthalpic interactions between the cosolute and the protein are not important, as appears to be the case here. Finally we use the experimental data and SPT to calculate the change in the number of sugar molecules excluded from the protein surface during unfolding from knowledge of the preferential binding parameter for the native and denatured state of the protein.",

        "abstract": "Gene 32 protein (g32P), the single-stranded (ss) DNA binding protein from bacteriophage T4, is a zinc metalloprotein. The intrinsic zinc is one of the factors required for the protein to bind cooperatively to a ssDNA lattice. We have used differential scanning calorimetry to determine how the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the denaturation of g32P are affected by removal or substitution of the intrinsic zinc. Over a wide concentration range (1-10 mg/mL), the native Zn(II) protein unfolds at a tm of 55 degrees C with an associated mean enthalpy change of 139 kcal mol-1. Under the same conditions, the metal-free apoprotein denatures over a relatively broader temperature range centered at 49 degrees C, with a mean enthalpy change of 84 kcal mol-1. Substitution of Zn(II) in g32P by either Cd(II) or Co(II) does not significantly change the enthalpy of denaturation but does affect the thermal stability of the protein. All metallo forms of g32P when bound to poly(dT) undergo highly cooperative denaturational transitions characterized by asymmetric differential scanning calorimetry peaks with increases in tm of 4-5 degrees C compared to the unliganded metalloprotein. Removal of the metal ion from g32P significantly reduces the cooperativity of binding to poly(dT) [Giedroc, D. P., Keating, K. M., Williams, K. R., & Coleman, J. E. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 5251-5259], and presumably as a consequence of this, apo-g32P shows no change in either the shape or the midpoint of the thermal transition on binding to poly(dT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

To obtain structural information on these intermediates, two of the three Trp residues in the protein were changed to Phe to generate a set of three single Trp mutant enzymes. These mutant enzymes were purified and characterized and shown to retain essentially all of the properties of the wild-type enzyme. The fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements of each mutant enzyme were studied under unfolding-refolding equilibrium conditions and during refolding. In addition, the sensitivity of the protein to digestion by subtilisin during refolding was investigated. The results of these studies show that the unfolded enzyme has two domains that rapidly fold to form a monomer in which the first 55 amino acids and a segment between residues 225 and 276 remain in a largely disordered form. This partially folded enzyme can form dimers and slowly undergoes a rate determining conformational change in which the unstructured segments assume their native state.",

In vivo, the MalE31 precursor is efficiently processed, but the mature protein forms inclusion bodies in the periplasm. Furthermore, the accumulation of insoluble MalE31 is independent of its cellular localization; MalE31 lacking its signal sequence forms inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. The native MalE31 protein can be purified by affinity chromatography from inclusion bodies after denaturation by 8 M urea. The renatured protein exhibits full maltose binding affinity (Kd= 9 x 10(-7) M), suggesting that its folded structure is similar to that of the wild-type protein. Unfolding/refolding experiments show that MalE31 is less stable (-5. 5 kcal/mol) than the wild-type protein (-9.5 kcal/mol) and that folding intermediates have a high tendency to form aggregates. In conclusion, the observed phenotype of cells expressing malE31 can be explained by a defective folding pathway of the protein.",

The structural unfolding properties of the colicin E1 channel peptide were analyzed using fluorescence techniques. The guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding pattern of the wild-type channel peptide was examined by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Additionally, peptide unfolding was examined with the fluorophore, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid. In order to probe the unfolding of local segments, single-tryptophan channel peptides were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Shifts in fluorescence emission maxima of the single tryptophan residues were used to monitor site-specific unfolding events, in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride. The unfolding patterns reported by tryptophans in different regions of the peptide were diverse. The concentration of guanidine hydrochloride at the unfolding transition midpoint for each mutant peptide and the free energy of unfolding were calculated in order to estimate local segment stabilities. Also, secondary structure unfolding was monitored using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results of unfolding analysis showed that the channel peptide's unfolding mechanism involves an intermediate structure stabilized by the C-terminal hydrophobic core of the peptide. Knowledge of the unfolding pattern of the soluble channel peptide will aid in the understanding of the secondary and tertiary structural interactions within the channel peptide and the mechanism of colicin E1 activation.",

        "abstract": "The Escherichia coli histone-like HU protein pool is composed of three dimeric forms: two homodimers, EcHUalpha(2) and EcHUbeta(2), and a heterodimer, EcHUalphabeta. The relative abundance of these dimeric forms varies during cell growth and in response to environmental changes, suggesting that each dimer plays different physiological roles. Here, differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism (CD) were used to study the thermal stability of the three E.coli HU dimers and show that each of them has its own thermodynamic signature. Unlike the other HU proteins studied so far, which melt through a single step (N(2)<-->2D), this present thermodynamic study shows that the three E.coli dimers melt according to a two-step mechanism (N(2)<-->I(2)<-->2D). The native dimer, N(2), melts partially into a dimeric intermediate, I(2), which in turn yields the unfolded monomers, D. In addition, the crystal structure of the EcHUalpha(2) dimer has been solved. Comparative thermodynamic and structural analysis between EcHUalpha(2) and the HU homodimer from Bacillus stearothermophilus suggests that the E.coli dimer is constituted by two subdomains of different energetic properties. The CD study indicates that the intermediate, I(2), corresponds to an HU dimer having partly lost its alpha-helices. The partially unfolded dimer I(2) is unable to complex with high-affinity, single-stranded break-containing DNA. These structural, thermodynamic and functional results suggest that the N(2)<-->I(2) equilibrium plays a central role in the physiology of E.coli HU. The I(2) molecular species seems to be the EcHUbeta(2) preferential conformation, possibly related to its role in the E.coli cold-shock adaptation. Besides, I(2) might be required in E.coli for the HU chain exchange, which allows the heterodimer formation from homodimers.",

        "abstract": "Developing a detailed understanding of the structure and energetics of protein folding transition states is a key step in describing the folding process. The phi-value analysis approach allows the energetic contribution of side-chains to be mapped out by comparing wild-type with individual mutants where conservative changes are introduced. Studies where multiple substitutions are made at individual sites are much rarer but are potentially very useful for understanding the contribution of each element of a side-chain to transition state formation, and for distinguishing the relative importance of specific packing versus hydrophobic interactions. We have made a series of conservative mutations at multiple buried sites in the N-terminal domain of L9 in order to assess the relative importance of specific side-chain packing versus less specific hydrophobic stabilization of the transition state. A total of 28 variants were prepared using both naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring amino acids at six sites. Analysis of the mutants by NMR and CD showed no perturbation of the structure. There is no correlation between changes in hydrophobicity and changes in stability. In contrast, there is excellent linear correlation between the hydrophobicity of a side-chain and the log of the folding rate, ln(k(f)). The correlation between ln(k(f)) and the change in hydrophobicity holds even for substitutions that change the shape and/or size of a side-chain significantly. For most sites, the correlation with the logarithm of the unfolding rate, ln(k(u)), is much worse. Mutants with more hydrophobic amino acid substitutions fold faster, and those with less hydrophobic amino acid substitutions fold slower. The results show that hydrophobic interactions amongst core residues are an important driving force for forming the transition state, and are more important than specific tight packing interactions. Finally, a number of substitutions lead to negative phi-values and the origin of these effects are described.",

        "abstract": "The secondary structure of ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) in aqueous solution and its temperature-induced structural changes have been investigated by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. 13 to 14% alpha-helix and 32 to 33% beta-sheet were estimated from the resolution-enhanced FT-IR spectra, in agreement with the crystal structure which indicates 16% alpha-helix and 35% beta-sheet. Specific IR-marker bands are assigned to the different beta-sheet structures, to the slightly bent alpha-helix, and to beta-turn and irregular conformations present in RNase T1. The temperature dependence of the infrared spectra shows that the thermal unfolding and refolding of RNase T1 is fully reversible. This permitted the detailed analysis of structural changes that occur as a function of temperature by evaluating quantitatively the various secondary structure-related amide I band components and some amino acid side-chain vibrations as specific monitors. The secondary structure of RNase T1 is essentially retained in the temperature range between 20 and 50 degrees C. Significant perturbation of protein structure is initiated between 50 and 55 degrees C within regions of beta-sheet structures while the alpha-helix remains virtually intact up to 55 degrees C suggesting a \"premelting\" of RNase T1. Between 55 and 60 degrees C, a highly co-operative unfolding process is indicated by the simultaneous breakdown of all secondary structure components and by distinct changes of some specific side-chain vibrations. An analysis of the amide I band contour of RNase T1 at 70 degrees C proves that the unfolded state is predominantly, but not completely, irregular or \"random coil\". Residual, turn-like structures persisting even in the unfolded state are suggested by minor, turn related band components in the amide I region. From IR-spectra collected along a linear temperature gradient, intensity/temperature and frequency/temperature profiles were constructed using some peptide backbone and amino acid side-chain marker bands as local, structure-sensitive monitors. From these profiles individual transition temperatures tm and transition enthalpies delta H (van't Hoff) were calculated. The tm and delta H values revealed a small but distinct hysteresis between repetitive cycles of unfolding and refolding of the protein, suggesting slow refolding kinetics of RNase T1. Furthermore, the various infrared \"marker bands\" indicate a slightly different response towards temperature increase/decrease for different regions of the protein. The data demonstrate that infrared spectroscopy permits both the detailed analysis of structural changes occurring in a protein as a function of temperature and the determination of thermodynamic parameters characterizing its folded/unfolded state transition.",

        "abstract": "The solution conformation properties of penicillin G acylase (EC 3.5.1.11) have been characterised by near- and far-ultraviolet circular dichroism, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and differential sedimentation velocity. The enzyme (86 kDa) was found to be spherical and stable unfolding over a narrow range of urea concentrations in an apparently cooperative fashion with a mid-point of 4.5 M urea. Separation of its constituent alpha and beta peptides (23.8 kDa and 62.2 kDa, respectively) was accompanied by loss of enzyme activity and unfolding, the kinetics of unfolding being highly dependent upon urea concentration. Urea gradient gel electrophoresis showed that the separated beta peptide aggregates over a wide range of urea concentrations but that the alpha peptide refolds reversibly to a compact state. Physical studies showed that the refolded alpha peptide has a compact but asymmetric structure with more alpha helix than the native enzyme, but is more sensitive to denaturant. The latter is suggested to be due to a hydrophobic patch detected by 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid binding and which is normally covered by the beta peptide in the native enzyme. The results of these investigations indicate that the alpha peptide constitutes a folding domain and suggest that it plays a key role in folding of the precursor for penicillin acylase.",

        "abstract": "The folding and unfolding reactions of the SH3 domain of spectrin can be described by a two-state model. This domain is a beta-sheet barrel containing 62 amino acids. Equilibrium unfolding by urea, guanidine hydrochloride, and heat is completely reversible at pH values below 4.0. At higher pH values the unfolding is reversible as long as the protein concentration is below 1 mg/mL. The Gibbs energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, delta GH2O, at pH 3.5 and 298 K is calculated to be 12 kJ mol-1 for urea, chemical, and temperature denaturation. The stability of the protein does not change noticeably between pH 5.0 and 7.0 and is around 15.5 kJ mol-1. Since heat effects of unfolding are relatively small and, as a result, heat-induced melting occurs in a wide temperature range, the analysis of scanning calorimetry data was performed taking into account the temperature dependence of unfolding delta Cp. The free energy of unfolding obtained for this domain (delta GH2O = 14 +/- 2 kJ mol-1) was, within experimental error, similar to those obtained in this work by other techniques and with those reported in the literature for small globular proteins. Kinetics of unfolding and refolding at pH 3.5, followed both by fluorescence and by circular dichroism, provide evidence of the simplest folding mechanism consistent with the two-state approximation. A value for delta GH2O = 13 +/- 0.7 kJ mol-1 can be extrapolated from the kinetic data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The guanidine hydrochloride induced equilibrium denaturation of insulin and proinsulin was studied by using near- and far-ultraviolet (UV) circular dichroism (CD). The denaturation transition of insulin is reversible, cooperative, symmetrical, and the same whether detected by near- or far-UV CD. These results are consistent with a two-state denaturation process without any appreciable equilibrium intermediates. Analysis of the insulin denaturation data yields a Gibbs free energy of unfolding of 4.5 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol. Denaturation of proinsulin detected by near-UV CD appears to be the same as for insulin, but if detected by far-UV CD appears different. The far-UV CD results demonstrate a multiphasic transition with the connecting peptide portion unfolding at lower concentrations of denaturant. Similar studies with the isolated C-peptide show that its conformation and susceptibility to denaturation are independent of the rest of the proinsulin molecule. After the proinsulin denaturation results were adjusted for the connecting peptide contribution, a denaturation transition identical with that of insulin was obtained. These results show that for proinsulin, the connecting peptide segment is not a random coil; it is an autonomous folding unit, and the portion corresponding to insulin is identical with insulin in terms of conformational stability.",

        "abstract": "In most proteins, a small but significant fraction of residues adopt phi,psi angles that generate unfavorable steric interactions between side-chain atoms and the peptide backbone. For the small protein staphylococcal nuclease, the X-ray structure reveals that 18 of 133 residues occupy unusual and, presumably, energetically unfavorable backbone conformations. To quantify the amount of strain energy generated by these local interactions, we have analyzed the changes in stability that accompany replacement of the wild-type side-chain with glycine, a residue that can access a much larger set of phi,psi angles without energy penalty. To correct for the many other sources of stability loss that might accompany this mutation, the glycine mutant was compared to an alanine mutant at the same position and the resulting free energy difference delta delta GG-->A was then compared to the average delta delta GG-->A at all other, unstrained positions in the nuclease occupied by similar amino acid types. In addition, potential steric clashes were introduced by substituting alanine at each of six positions occupied in the wild-type by glycine with phi,psi angles that are unfavorable for all other residue types. The data suggest that residues with phi,psi angles outside the preferred alpha-helical and beta-sheet regions represent sites of local strain energy that lower the stability of the native state by 1 to 2 kcal/mol and, in some cases, as much as 3 to 4 kcal/mol. Given that 10 to 20% of residues in globular proteins adopt phi,psi angles outside the preferred alpha-helical and beta-sheet regions, this implies that there is on the order of 20 kcal/mol of strain energy in a protein of 100 residues that may be relieved by appropriate mutations.",

        "abstract": "Structure formation and dimerization are concerted processes in the refolding of Arc repressor. The integrity of secondary structure in the transition state of Arc refolding has been investigated here by determining the changes in equilibrium stability and refolding/unfolding kinetics for a set of Ala --> Gly mutations at residues that are solvent-exposed in the native Arc dimer. At some sites, reduced stability was caused primarily by faster unfolding, indicating that secondary structure at these positions is largely absent in the transition state. However, most of the Ala --> Gly substitutions in the alpha-helices of Arc and a triple mutant in the beta-sheet also resulted in decreased refolding rates, in some cases, accounting for the major fraction of thermodynamic destabilization. Overall, these results suggest that some regions of native secondary structure are present but incompletely formed in the transition state of Arc refolding and dimerization. Consolidation of this secondary structure, like close packing of the hydrophobic core, seems to occur later in the folding process. On average, Phi(F) values for the Ala --> Gly mutations were significantly larger than Phi(F) values previously determined for alanine-substitution mutants, suggesting that backbone interactions in the transition state may be stronger than side chain interactions. Mutations causing significant reductions in the Arc refolding rate were found to cluster in the central turn of alpha-helix A and in the first two turns of alpha-helix B. In the Arc dimer, these elements pack together in a compact structure, which might serve as nucleus for further folding.",

        "abstract": "The interaction of urea and guanidinium chloride with proteins has been studied calorimetrically by titrating protein solutions with denaturants at various fixed temperatures, and by scanning them with temperature at various fixed concentrations of denaturants. It has been shown that the observed heat effects can be described in terms of a simple binding model with independent and similar binding sites. Using the calorimetric data, the number of apparent binding sites for urea and guanidinium chloride have been estimated for three proteins in their unfolded and native states (ribonuclease A, hen egg white lysozyme and cytochrome c). The intrinsic and total thermodynamic characteristics of their binding (the binding constant, the Gibbs energy, enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity effect of binding) have also been determined. It is found that the binding of urea and guanidinium chloride by protein is accompanied by a significant decrease of enthalpy and entropy. At all concentrations of denaturants the enthalpy term slightly dominates the entropy term in the Gibbs energy function. Correlation analysis of the number of binding sites and structural characteristics of these proteins suggests that the binding sites for urea and guanidinium chloride are likely to be formed by several hydrogen bonding groups. This type of binding of the denaturant molecules should lead to a significant restriction of conformational freedom within the polypeptide chain. This raises a doubt as to whether a polypeptide chain in concentrated solutions of denaturants can be considered as a standard of a random coil conformation.",

        "abstract": "How tightly packed is the hydrophobic core of a folding transition state structure? We have addressed this question by characterizing the effects on folding kinetics of > 40 substitutions of both large and small amino acids in the hydrophobic core of the Fyn SH3 domain. Our results show that residues at three positions, which we designate as the 'core folding nucleus', are tightly packed in the transition state, and substitutions at these positions cause the largest changes in the folding rate. The other six positions examined appear to be loosely packed; thus, substitutions at these positions with larger hydrophobic residues generally accelerate folding, presumably by increasing the rate of nonspecific hydrophobic collapse. Surprisingly, the folding rate can be greatly accelerated by residues that also significantly destabilize the native state structure. Furthermore, mutants with identical thermodynamic stability can differ by up to 55-fold in their folding rates. These results highlight the importance of hydrophobic core composition, as opposed to only topology, in determining the folding rate of a protein. They also provide a new explanation for the 'abnormal' phi-values observed in many protein folding kinetics studies.",

        "abstract": "We have characterized the guanidine-induced unfolding of both yeast and bovine ubiquitin at 25 degrees C and in the acidic pH range on the basis of fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. Unfolding Gibbs energy changes calculated by linear extrapolation from high guanidine unfolding data are found to depend very weakly on pH. A simple explanation for this result involves the two following assumptions: (1) charged atoms of ionizable groups are exposed to the solvent in native ubiquitin (as supported by accessible surface area calculations), and Gibbs energy contributions associated with charge desolvation upon folding (a source of pK shifts) are small; (2) charge-charge interactions (another source of pK shifts upon folding) are screened out in concentrated guanidinium chloride solutions. We have also characterized the thermal unfolding of both proteins using differential scanning calorimetry. Unfolding Gibbs energy changes calculated from the calorimetric data do depend strongly on pH, a result that we attribute to the pH dependence of charge-charge interactions (not eliminated in the absence of guanidine). In fact, we find good agreement between the difference between the two series of experimental unfolding Gibbs energy changes (determined from high guanidine unfolding data by linear extrapolation and from thermal denaturation data in the absence of guanidine) and the theoretical estimates of the contribution from charge-charge interactions to the Gibbs energy change for ubiquitin unfolding obtained by using the solvent-accessibility-corrected Tanford-Kirkwood model, together with the Bashford-Karplus (reduced-set-of-sites) approximation. This contribution is found to be stabilizing at neutral pH, because most charged groups on the native protein interact mainly with groups of the opposite charge, a fact that, together with the absence of large charge-desolvation contributions, may explain the high stability of ubiquitin at neutral pH. In general, our analysis suggests the possibility of enhancing protein thermal stability by adequately redesigning the distribution of solvent-exposed, charged residues on the native protein surface.",

        "abstract": "Comparatively little is known about the role of non-native interactions in protein folding and their role in both folding and stability is controversial. We demonstrate that non-native electrostatic interactions involving specific residues in the denatured state can have a significant effect upon protein stability and can persist in the transition state for folding. Mutation of a single surface exposed residue, Lys12 to Met, in the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 (NTL9), significantly increased the stability of the protein and led to faster folding. Structural and energetic studies of the wild-type and K12M mutant show that the 1.9 kcal mol(-1) increase in stability is not due to native state effects, but rather is caused by modulation of specific non-native electrostatic interactions in the denatured state. pH dependent stability measurements confirm that the increased stability of the K12M is due to the elimination of favorable non-native interactions in the denatured state. Kinetic studies show that the non-native electrostatic interactions involving K12 persist in the transition state. The analysis demonstrates that canonical Phi-values can arise from the disruption of non-native interactions as well as from the development of native interactions.",

        "abstract": "pKa values were measured for the 6 carboxylates in the N-terminal domain of L9 (NTL9) by following NMR chemical shifts as a function of pH. The contribution of each carboxylate to the pH dependent stability of NTL9 was estimated by comparing the pKa values for the native and denatured state of the protein. A set of peptides with sequences derived from NTL9 were used to model the denatured state. In the protein fragments, the pKa values measured for the aspartates varied between 3.8 and 4.1 and the pKa values measured for the glutamates varied between 4.1 and 4.6. These results indicate that the local sequence can significantly influence pKa values in the denatured state and highlight the difficulties in using standard pKa values derived from small compounds. Calculations based on the measured pKa values suggest that the free energy of unfolding of NTL9 should decrease by 4.4 kcal mol-1 when the pH is lowered from 6 to 2. In contrast, urea and thermal denaturation experiments indicate that the stability of the protein decreases by only 2.6 kcal mol-1 when the carboxylates are protonated. This discrepancy indicates that the protein fragments are not a complete representation of the denatured state and that nonlocal sequence effects perturb the pKa's in the denatured state. Increasing the salt concentration from 100 to 750 mM NaCl removes the discrepancy between the stabilities derived from denaturation experiments and the stability changes calculated from the pKa values. At high concentrations of salt there is also less variation of the pKa values measured in the protein fragments. Our results argue that in the denatured state of NTL9 there are electrostatic interactions between groups both local and nonlocal in primary sequence.",

The overall structure is well-defined with a rms difference for the backbone atoms of 0.27 +/- 0.06 A. The topology of the protein is identical to those of the human and E. coli parent proteins, consisting of a central five-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helices. Analysis of the interfaces between the two domains derived from the human and E. coli sequences reveals that the general hydrophobic packing is unaltered and only subtle changes in the details of side chain interactions are observed. The packing of helix alpha(4) with helix alpha(2) across the hybrid interface is less optimal than in the parent molecules, and electrostatic interactions between polar side chains are missing. In particular, lysine-glutamate salt bridges between residues on helices alpha(2) and alpha(4), which were observed in both human and E. coli proteins, are not present in the chimeric protein. The origin of the known reduced thermodynamic stability of TRX(HE) was probed by mutagenesis on the basis of these structural findings. Two mutants of TRX(HE), S44D and S44E, were created, and their thermal and chemical stabilities were examined. Improved stability toward chaotropic agents was observed for both mutants, but no increase in the denaturation temperature was seen compared to that of TRX(HE). In addition to the structural analysis, the backbone dynamics of TRX(HE) were investigated by (15)N NMR relaxation measurements. Analysis using the model free approach reveals that the protein is fairly rigid with an average S(2) of 0.88. Increased mobility is primarily present in two external loop regions comprising residues 72-74 and 92-94 that contain glycine and proline residues.",

The main classes of osmolytes are sugars, polyhydric alcohols, amino acids and their derivatives, and methylamines, and all are known to be protein stabilizers. However, marine cartilaginous fishes and the coelacanth use, as osmolytes, a combination of urea and methylamines, i.e., a denaturant and a stabilizer, in a 2:1 molar ratio. Preferential binding and thermal denaturation measurements in the presence of each cosolvent separately and in their mixtures have been carried out using ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) as the protein. At a 2:1 molar ratio of urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the effects of the two cosolvents on the transition temperature (Tm) were found to be essentially the algebraic sum of their effects when used individually. Preferential interaction measurements of urea, TMAO and urea in its 2:1 molar ratio mixture with TMAO, have shown that the presence of TMAO has no effect on the interaction of urea with the protein in either the native or the unfolded (reduced carboxymethylated RNase T1) state. The preferential interaction of TMAO in the presence of urea could not be measured for technical reasons. Calculations of transfer free energy in the two end states of the denaturation reaction have shown that 2 M urea destabilizes RNase T1 by 3.8 +/- 0.3 kcal/mol whether 1 M TMAO is present or not. The contribution of 1 M TMAO to stabilization is calculated to be 3.1 kcal/mol in the presence of 2 M urea and is measured to be 2.7 kcal/mol in its absence.",

The interpretation of folding kinetics in viscous solvents has remained difficult and controversial, in that viscogenic agents affect folding rates not only by increasing solvent viscosity but also by increasing protein stability. By carefully choosing experimental conditions, we can now eliminate the effect on stability and show that the folding dynamics of the cold shock protein CspB are viscosity dependent. Thus Kramers' theory of reaction rates rather than transition state theory should be used to describe this folding reaction.",

        "abstract": "The structure, stability, and unfolding-refolding kinetics of a chimeric protein, in which the amino acid sequence of the flexible loop region (residues 105-110) comes from equine lysozyme and the remainder of the sequence comes from bovine alpha-lactalbumin were studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy and stopped-flow measurements, and the results were compared with those of bovine alpha-lactalbumin. The substitution of the flexible loop in bovine alpha-lactalbumin with the helix D of equine lysozyme destabilizes the molten globule state, although the native state is significantly stabilized by substitution of the flexible loop region. The kinetic refolding and unfolding experiments showed that the chimeric protein refolds significantly faster and unfolds substantially slower than bovine alpha-lactalbumin. To characterize the transition state between the molten globule and the native states, we investigated the guanidine hydrochloride concentration dependence of the rate constants of refolding and unfolding. Despite the significant differences in the stabilities of both the molten globule and native states between the chimeric protein and bovine alpha-lactalbumin, the free energy level of the transition state is not affected by the amino acid substitution in the flexible loop region. Our results suggest that the destabilization in the molten globule state of the chimeric protein is caused by the disruption of the non-native interaction in the flexible loop region and that the disruption of the non-native interaction reduces the free energy barrier of refolding. We conclude that the non-native interaction in the molten globule state may act as a kinetic trap for the folding of alpha-lactalbumin.",

        "abstract": "The contribution of the hydrophobic contact in the C-capping motif of the alpha-helix to the thermodynamic stability of the ubiquitin molecule has been analyzed. For this, 16 variants of ubiquitin containing the full combinatorial set of four nonpolar residues Val, Ile, Leu, and Phe at C4 (Ile30) and C' ' (Ile36) positions were generated. The secondary structure content as estimated using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of all but Phe variants at position 30 did not show notable changes upon substitutions. The thermodynamic stability of these ubiquitin variants was measured using differential scanning calorimetry, and it was shown that all variants have lower stability as measured by decreases in the Gibbs energy. Since in some cases the decrease in stability was so dramatic that it rendered an unfolded protein, it was therefore concluded that, despite apparent preservation of the secondary structure, the 30/36 hydrophobic contact is essential for the stability of the ubiquitin molecule. The decrease in the Gibbs energy in many cases was found to be accompanied by a large (up to 25%) decrease in the enthalpy of unfolding, particularly significant in the variants containing Ile to Leu substitutions. This decrease in enthalpy of unfolding is proposed to be primarily the result of the perturbed packing interactions in the native state of the Ile --> Leu variants. The analysis of these data and comparison with effects of similar amino acid substitutions on the stability of other model systems suggest that Ile --> Leu substitutions cannot be isoenergetic at the buried site.",

        "abstract": "The thermal transition of RNase T1 was studied by two different methods; tryptophan residue fluorescence and circular dichroism. The fluorescence measurements provide information about the environment of the indole group and CD measurements on the gross conformation of the polypeptide chain. Both measurements at pH 5 gave the same transition temperature of 56 degrees C and the same thermodynamic quantities, delta Htr (= 120 kcal/mol) and delta Str (= 360 eu/mol), for the transition from the native state to the thermally denatured state, indicating simultaneous melting of the whole molecule including the hydrophobic region where the tryptophan residue is buried. Stabilization by salts was observed in the pH range from 2 to 10, since the presence of 0.5 m NaCL caused an increase of about 5 degrees C to 10 degrees C in the transition temperature, depending on the pH. The fluorescence measurements on the RNase T1 complexed with 2'-GMP showed a transition with delta Htr =167 kcal/mol and delta Str =497 eu/mol at a transition temperature about 6 degrees C higher than that for the free enzyme. The large value of delta Htr for RNase T1 indicates the highly cooperative nature of the thermal transition; this value is much higher than those of other globular proteins. Analysis of the CD spectrum of thermally denatured RNase T1 suggests that the denatured state is not completely random but retains some ordered structures.",

        "abstract": "The tertiary structure of lipid-free apolipoprotein (apo) A-I in the monomeric state comprises two domains: a N-terminal alpha-helix bundle and a less organized C-terminal domain. This study examined how the N- and C-terminal segments of apoA-I (residues 1-43 and 223-243), which contain the most hydrophobic regions in the molecule and are located in opposite structural domains, contribute to the lipid-free conformation and lipid interaction. Measurements of circular dichroism in conjunction with tryptophan and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence data demonstrated that single (L230P) or triple (L230P/L233P/Y236P) proline insertions into the C-terminal alpha helix disrupted the organization of the C-terminal domain without affecting the stability of the N-terminal helix bundle. In contrast, proline insertion into the N terminus (Y18P) disrupted the bundle structure in the N-terminal domain, indicating that the alpha-helical segment in this region is part of the helix bundle. Calorimetric and gel-filtration measurements showed that disruption of the C-terminal alpha helix significantly reduced the enthalpy and free energy of binding of apoA-I to lipids, whereas disruption of the N-terminal alpha helix had only a small effect on lipid binding. Significantly, the presence of the Y18P mutation offset the negative effects of disruption/removal of the C-terminal helical domain on lipid binding, suggesting that the alpha helix around Y18 concealed a potential lipid-binding region in the N-terminal domain, which was exposed by the disruption of the helix-bundle structure. When these results are taken together, they indicate that the alpha-helical segment in the N terminus of apoA-I modulates the lipid-free structure and lipid interaction in concert with the C-terminal domain.",

Previous studies on stabilizing mutations of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, a prototype of serpins, indicated that cavities provide a structural basis for the native strain of the molecule. We have systematically mapped the cavities of alpha(1)-antitrypsin that play such structural and functional roles by designing cavity-filling mutations at residues that line the walls of the cavities. Results show that energetically unfavorable cavities are distributed throughout the alpha(1)-antitrypsin molecule, and the cavity-filling mutations stabilized the native conformation at 8 out of 10 target sites. The stabilization effect of the individual cavity-filling mutations of alpha(1)-antitrypsin varied (0.2-1.9 kcal/mol for each additional methylene group) and appeared to depend largely on the structural flexibility of the cavity environment. Cavity-filling mutations that decreased inhibitory activity of alpha(1)-antitrypsin were localized in the loop regions that interact with beta-sheet A distal from the reactive center loop. The results are consistent with the notion that beta-sheet A and the structure around it mobilize when alpha(1)-antitrypsin forms a complex with a target protease.",

        "abstract": "It was recently shown that alpha-lactalbumin interacts with histones and simple models of histone proteins such as positively charged polyamino acids, suggesting that some fundamental aspects of the protein surface electrostatics may come into play. In the present work, the energies of charge-charge interaction in apo- and Ca(2+)-loaded alpha-lactalbumin were calculated using a Tanford-Kirkwood algorithm with either solvent accessibility correction or using a finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann method. The analysis revealed two major regions of alpha-lactalbumin that possessed highly unfavorable electrostatic potentials: (a) the Ca(2+)-binding loop and its neighboring residues and (b) the N-terminal region of the protein. Several individual mutants were prepared to neutralize specific individual surface acidic amino acids at both the N-terminus and Ca(2+)-binding loop of bovine alpha-lactalbumin. These mutants were characterized by intrinsic fluorescence, differential scanning microcalorimetry and circular dichroism. The structural and thermodynamic data agree in every case with the theoretical predictions, confirming that the N-terminal region is very sensitive to changes in charge. For example, desMet D14N mutation destabilizes protein and decreases its calcium affinity. On the other hand, desMet E1M and desMet D37N substitutions increase the thermal stability and calcium affinity. The Met E1Q is characterized by a marked increase in protein stability, whereas desMet E7Q and desMet E11L display a slight increase in calcium affinity and thermal stability. Examination of the unfavorable energy contributed by Glu1 and the energetically favorable consequences of neutralizing this residue suggests that nature may have made an error with bovine alpha-lactalbumin from the viewpoint of stabilizing structure and conformation.",

The heat capacity curve of the intermediate has no excess heat capacity nor any transition. This indicates that the intermediate is a thermodynamically denatured form. Although the intermediate retains significant CD signal in the far-uv region, the tertiary structure of the intermediate is disrupted as judged by the near-uv CD spectra and 1H NMR spectra in the aromatic region. This intermediate might be similar to a molten globule state.

        "abstract": "SH3 domains are small, modular domains that are found in many proteins, especially signal transduction proteins such as tyrosine kinases. While much is known about the sequences and tertiary structures of SH3 domains, far less is known about their solution dynamics. A slow, partial unfolding event that occurs under physiological conditions was previously identified in the Hck SH3 domain using hydrogen exchange (HX) mass spectrometry (MS). To determine if this unfolding was unique to Hck SH3, HX MS was used to analyze 11 other SH3 domains: seven SH3 domains from Src-family kinases and five SH3 domains from various proteins. A wide variety of unfolding rates were found, with unfolding half-lives ranging from 1s to 1h. The Lyn and alpha-spectrin SH3 domains exhibited slow, partial unfolding in beta strands D and E and part of the RT-loop. Hck SH3 also underwent partial unfolding in the same region, implying that a unique feature in this area of the domains is responsible for the partial unfolding. Partial unfolding was, however, not a function of sequence conservation. Although the Fyn and Yes SH3 domains are very similar to Hck SH3 in sequence, they exhibited no evidence of partial unfolding. Overall, the results suggest that while the tertiary structure of SH3 domains is highly conserved, the dynamics of SH3 domains are variable.",

To clarify the possible role of the disulphide bond in the stability and folding kinetics of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase, this bond was removed by introducing a Cys-77-->Ser mutation, and the enzymically active mutant protein was studied by reversible guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation. The unfolding and refolding rates were monitored using tryptophan fluorescence. At low guanidine hydrochloride concentrations, the refolding of the wild-type and mutant enzymes followed biphasic time courses. The characteristics of the two phases were not significantly affected by the mutation. Double-jump experiments, in which the protein was unfolded in a high concentration of guanidine hydrochloride for a short time period and then refolded by diluting out the denaturant, indicated that, for both the wild-type and mutant enzymes, the two refolding phases could be ascribed to proline isomerization reactions. Equilibrium unfolding experiments monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and far-UV CD indicated a three-state mechanism (N<-->H<--U). Both the folded mutant protein (N) and, to a lesser extent the thermodynamically stable intermediate, H. were destabilized relative to the fully unfolded state, U. Removal of the disulphide bond resulted in a decrease of 14.2 kJ/mol (3.4 kcal/mol) in the global free energy of stabilization. Similarly, the mutation also induced a drastic increase in the rate of thermal inactivation.",

        "abstract": "Here, we show that an unfolded intermediate of canine milk lysozyme is extraordinarily stable compared with that of the other members of the lysozyme-alpha-lactalbumin superfamily, which has been studied previously. The stability of the intermediate of this protein was investigated using calorimetry, CD spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy, and the results were interpreted in terms of the structure revealed by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.85 A to an R-factor of 17.8%. On the basis of the results of the thermal unfolding, this protein unfolds in two clear cooperative stages, and the melting temperature from the intermediate to the unfolded states is about 20 degrees C higher than that of equine milk lysozyme. Furthermore, the (1)H NMR spectra of canine milk lysozyme at 60 degrees C, essentially 100% of which exists in the intermediate, showed that small resonance peaks that arise from ring-current shifts of aliphatic protons are still present in the upfield region from 0 to -1 ppm. The protein at this temperature (60 degrees C) and pH 4.5 has been found to bind 1-anilino-naphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) with enhancement of the fluorescence intensity compared with that of native and thermally unfolded states. We interpret that the extraordinarily stable intermediate is a molten globule state, and the extraordinary stabilization of the molten globule state comes from stronger protection around the C- and D-helix of the aromatic cluster region due to the His-21 residue. The conclusion helps to explain how the molten globule state acquires its structure and stability.",

This activity is essential for retroviruses such as HIV and resides in a domain of the larger reverse transcriptase molecule. RNase H from Escherichia coli is the best-characterized member of the family and serves as a model for structure/function studies. Despite having almost identical alpha + beta folds, the isolated domain from HIV is inactive and much less stable than the E. coli homolog. The HIV domain also shows increased disorder in its C-terminal regions (E-helix and His-containing loop). We investigated the importance of this region by studying a variant of E. coli RNase H lacking these elements (RNHdeltaE). Despite the elimination of 33 of 155 residues (including a complete helix), this C-terminal deletion mutant folds cooperatively as a subdomain. Surprisingly, this protein lacking residues near the active site retains weak Mn2+-dependent activity. A peptide corresponding to the deleted E-helix is helical in isolation and stimulates the activity of the deletion mutant in vitro. These results have implications for the catalytic mechanism of RNase H and drug design targeted to HIV reverse transcriptase.",

Variants were constructed in which the H. resinae linker was elongated by proline-rich sequences as this linker itself apparently was too short to allow formation of the corresponding protein variant. Size and isoelectric point of GA1 variants reflected differences in linker length, posttranslational modification, and net charge. While calculated polypeptide chain molecular masses for wild-type GA1, a nonnatural proline-rich linker variant, H. grisea, and R. oryzae linker variants were 65,784, 63,777, 63,912, and 65,614 Da, respectively, MALDI-TOF-MS gave values of 82,042, 73,800, 73,413, and 90,793 Da, respectively, where the latter value could partly be explained by an N-glycosylation site introduced near the linker C-terminus. The k(cat) and K(m) for hydrolysis of maltooligodextrins and soluble starch, and the rate of hydrolysis of barley starch granules were essentially the same for the variants as for wild-type GA1. beta-Cyclodextrin, acarbose, and two heterobidentate inhibitors were found by isothermal titration calorimetry to bind to the catalytic and starch binding domains of the linker variants, indicating that the function of the active site and the starch binding site was maintained.

In the current study, a series of amino-terminal fragments were characterized to probe the elementary folding units that may be in part responsible for this complex behavior. Stop-codon mutagenesis was used to produce eight fragments ranging in size from 105-214 residues and containing incremental elements of secondary structure. Equilibrium studies by circular dichroism indicate that all of these fragments are capable of adopting secondary structure. All except for the shortest fragment fold cooperatively. The addition of the fourth, sixth, and eighth beta-strands leads to distinct increases in structure, cooperativity, and/or stability, suggesting that folding involves the modular assembly of betaalphabeta supersecondary structural elements. One-dimensional NMR titrations at high concentrations of urea, probing the environment around His92, were also performed to test for the presence of residual structure in the fragments. All fragments that contained the first four betaalpha units of structure exhibited a cooperative unfolding transition at high concentrations of urea with significant but reduced stability relative to the full-length protein. These results suggest that the residual structure in alphaTS requires the participation of hydrophobic residues in multiple beta-strands that span the entire sequence.",

        "abstract": "Random chemical mutagenesis, in vitro, of the 5' portion of the Escherichia coli trpA gene has yielded 66 mutant alpha subunits containing single amino acid substitutions at 49 different residue sites within the first 121 residues of the protein; this portion of the alpha subunit contains four of the eight alpha helices and three of the eight beta strands in the protein. Sixty-two of the subunits were examined for their heat stabilities by sensitivity to enzymatic inactivation (52 degrees C for 20 min) in crude extracts and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with 29 purified proteins. The enzymatic activities of mutant alpha subunits that contained amino acid substitutions within the alpha and beta secondary structures were more heat labile than the wild-type alpha subunit. Alterations only in three regions, at or immediately C-terminal to the first three beta strands, were stability neutral or stability enhancing with respect to enzymatic inactivation. Enzymatic thermal inactivation appears to be correlated with the relative accessibility of the substituted residues; stability-neutral mutations are found at accessible residual sites, stability-enhancing mutations at buried sites. DSC analyses showed a similar pattern of stabilization/destabilization as indicated by inactivation studies. Tm differences from the wild-type alpha subunit varied +/- 7.6 degrees C. Eighteen mutant proteins containing alterations in helical and sheet structures had Tm's significantly lower (-1.6 to -7.5 degrees C) than the wild-type Tm (59.5 degrees C). In contrast, 6 mutant alpha subunits with alterations in the regions following beta strands 1 and 3 had increased Tm's (+1.4 to +7.6 degrees C). Because of incomplete thermal reversibilities for many of the mutant alpha subunits, most likely due to identifiable aggregated forms in the unfolded state, reliable differences in thermodynamic stability parameters are not possible. The availability of this group of mutant alpha subunits which clearly contain structural alterations should prove useful in defining the roles of certain residues or sequences in the unfolding/folding pathway for this protein when examined by urea/guaninidine denaturation kinetic analysis.",

        "abstract": "The first crystal structure of an inorganic pyrophosphatase (S-PPase) from an archaebacterium, the thermophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, has been solved by molecular replacement and refined to an R-factor of 19.7% at 2.7 A. S-PPase is a D3 homohexameric protein with one Mg2+ per active site in a position similar to, but not identical with, the first activating metal in mesophilic pyrophosphatases (PPase). In mesophilic PPases, Asp65, Asp70, and Asp102 coordinate the Mg2+, while only Asp65 and Asp102 do in S-PPase, and the Mg2+ moves by 0.7 A. S-PPase may therefore be deactivated at low temperature by mispositioning a key metal ion. The monomer S-PPase structure is very similar to that of Thermus thermophilus (T-PPase) and Escherichia coli (E-PPase), root-mean-square deviations around 1 A/Calpha. But the hexamer structures of S- and T-PPase are more tightly packed and more similar to each other than they are to that of E-PPase, as shown by the increase in surface area buried upon oligomerization. In T-PPase, Arg116 creates an interlocking ionic network to both twofold and threefold related monomers; S-PPase has hydrophilic interactions to threefold related monomers absent in both E- and T-PPase. In addition, the thermostable PPases have about 7% more hydrogen bonds per monomer than E-PPase, and, especially in S-PPase, additional ionic interactions anchor the C-terminus to the rest of the protein. Thermostability in PPases is thus due to subtle improvements in both monomer and oligomer interactions.",

        "abstract": "The conformational stability of a single-chain Fv antibody fragment against a hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg scFv) has been studied by urea and temperature denaturation followed by fluorescence and circular dichroism. At neutral pH and low protein concentration, it is a well-folded monomer, and its urea and thermal denaturations are reversible. The noncoincidence of the fluorescence and circular dichroism transitions indicates the accumulation in the urea denaturation of an intermediate (I(1)) not previously described in scFv molecules. In addition, at higher urea concentrations, a red-shift in the fluorescence emission maximum reveals an additional intermediate (I(2)), already reported in the denaturation of other scFvs. The urea equilibrium unfolding of the anti-HBsAg scFv is thus four-state. A similar four-state behavior is observed in the thermal unfolding although the intermediates involved are not identical to those found in the urea denaturation. Global analysis of the thermal unfolding data suggests that the first intermediate displays substantial secondary structure and some well-defined tertiary interactions while the second one lacks well-defined tertiary interactions but is compact and unfolds at higher temperature in a noncooperative fashion. Global analysis of the urea unfolding data (together with the modeled structure of the scFv) provides insights into the conformation of the chemical denaturation intermediates and allows calculation of the N-I(1), I(1)-I(2), and I(2)-D free energy differences. Interestingly, although the N-D free energy difference is very large, the N-I(1) one, representing the \"relevant\" conformational stability of the scFv, is small.",

        "abstract": "Point mutations in proteins can have different effects on protein stability depending on the mechanism of unfolding. In the most interesting case of I27, the Ig-like module of the muscle protein titin, one point mutation (Y9P) yields opposite effects on protein stability during denaturant-induced \"global unfolding\" versus \"vectorial unfolding\" by mechanical pulling force or cellular unfolding systems. Here, we assessed the reason for the different effects of the Y9P mutation of I27 on the overall molecular stability and N-terminal unraveling by NMR. We found that the Y9P mutation causes a conformational change that is transmitted through beta-sheet structures to reach the central hydrophobic core in the interior and alters its accessibility to bulk solvent, which leads to destabilization of the hydrophobic core. On the other hand, the Y9P mutation causes a bend in the backbone structure, which leads to the formation of a more stable N-terminal structure probably through enhanced hydrophobic interactions.",

        "abstract": "Thermal denaturation studies as a function of pH were carried out on wild-type iso-1-cytochrome c and three variants of this protein at the solvent-exposed position 73 of the sequence. By examining the enthalpy and Tm at various pH values, the heat capacity increment (delta Cp), which is dominated by the degree of change in nonpolar hydration upon protein unfolding, was found for the wild type where lysine 73 is normally present and for three variants. For the Trp 73 variant, the delta Cp value (1.15 +/- 0.17 kcal/mol K) decreased slightly relative to wild-type iso-1-cytochrome c (1.40 +/- 0.06 kcal/mol K), while for the Ile 73 (1.65 +/- 0.07 kcal/mol K) and the Val 73 (1.50 +/- 0.06 kcal/mol K) variants, delta Cp increased slightly. In previous studies, the Trp 73, Ile 73, and Val 73 variants have been shown to have decreased m-values in guanidine hydrochloride denaturations relative to the wild-type protein (Hermann L, Bowler BE, Dong A, Caughey WS. 1995. The effects of hydrophilic to hydrophobic surface mutations on the denatured state of iso-1-cytochrome c: Investigation of aliphatic residues. Biochemistry 34:3040-3047). Both the m-value and delta Cp are related to the change in solvent exposure upon unfolding and other investigators have shown a correlation exists between these two parameters. However, for this subset of variants of iso-1-cytochrome c, a lack of correlation exists which implies that there may be basic differences between the guanidine hydrochloride and thermal denaturations of this protein. Spectroscopic data are consistent with different denatured states for thermal and guanidine hydrochloride unfolding. The different response of m-values and delta Cp for these variants will be discussed in this context.",

        "abstract": "The self-assembling MexA-MexB-OprM efflux pump system, encoded by the mexO operon, contributes to facile resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by actively extruding multiple antimicrobials. MexR negatively regulates the mexO operon, comprising two adjacent MexR binding sites, and is as such highly targeted by mutations that confer multidrug resistance (MDR). To understand how MDR mutations impair MexR function, we studied MexR-wt as well as a selected set of MDR single mutants distant from the proposed DNA-binding helix. Although DNA affinity and MexA-MexB-OprM repression were both drastically impaired in the selected MexR-MDR mutants, MexR-wt bound its two binding sites in the mexO with high affinity as a dimer. In the MexR-MDR mutants, secondary structure content and oligomerization properties were very similar to MexR-wt despite their lack of DNA binding. Despite this, the MexR-MDR mutants showed highly varying stabilities compared with MexR-wt, suggesting disturbed critical interdomain contacts, because mutations in the DNA-binding domains affected the stability of the dimer region and vice versa. Furthermore, significant ANS binding to MexR-wt in both free and DNA-bound states, together with increased ANS binding in all studied mutants, suggest that a hydrophobic cavity in the dimer region already shown to be involved in regulatory binding is enlarged by MDR mutations. Taken together, we propose that the biophysical MexR properties that are targeted by MDR mutations-stability, domain interactions, and internal hydrophobic surfaces-are also critical for the regulation of MexR DNA binding.",

The experimental results showed that there is no correlation between the stability of albumin at different pH values determined by both methods. The free energy change of unfolding versus concentration of guanidine showed a close dependence on the pH, suggesting that the variation of the electrical charge of albumin influences the final state of the unfolded form of the protein. Spectroscopic techniques, such as native fluorescence of the protein and circular dichroism, demonstrated that the unfolded state of the protein obtained from both methods possesses a different helical content. The solvophobic effect and the entropy of the chains have no influence on the final unfolding state when the protein is unfolded by thermal treatment, while, when the protein is unfolded by chemical denaturants, both effects depend on the medium pH. The results indicate that guanidine and urea interact with albumin by electrostatic forces, yielding a randomly coiled conformation in its unfolded state, while thermal denaturation produces a molten globule state and the aggregation of the protein; therefore, both methods yield different structurally unfolded states of the albumin.",

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the amide I' band and far-uv circular dichroism (CD) spectra were used to monitor changes in the secondary structure. Changes in the tertiary structure were monitored by near-uv CD. Spectral bandshape changes with change in temperature were analyzed using factor analysis. The global unfolding curves obtained from DSC confirmed that structural changes occur in the molecule before the main thermal denaturation transition. The analysis of the far-uv CD and FTIR spectra showed that these lower temperature-induced modifications occur in the secondary structure. No pretransition changes in the tertiary structure (near-uv CD) were observed. The initial changes observed in far-uv CD were attributed to the fraying of the helical segments, which would explain the loss of spectral intensity with almost no modification of spectral bandshape. Separate analyses of different regions of the FTIR amide I' band indicate that, in addition to alpha-helix, part of the pretransitional change also occurs in the beta-strands.",

        "abstract": "Acylphosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of the carboxyl-phosphate bond in acyl phosphates. Although acylphosphatase-like sequences are found in all three domains of life, no structure of acylphosphatase has been reported for bacteria and archaea so far. Here, we report the characterization of enzymatic activities and crystal structure of an archaeal acylphosphatase. A putative acylphosphatase gene (PhAcP) was cloned from the genomic DNA of Pyrococcus horikoshii and was expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzymatic parameters of the recombinant PhAcP were measured using benzoyl phosphate as the substrate. Our data suggest that, while PhAcP is less efficient than other mammalian homologues at 25 degrees C, the thermophilic enzyme is fully active at the optimal growth temperature (98 degrees C) of P. horikoshii. PhAcP is extremely stable; its apparent melting temperature was 111.5 degrees C and free energy of unfolding at 25 degrees C was 54 kJ mol(-)(1). The 1.5 A crystal structure of PhAcP adopts an alpha/beta sandwich fold that is common to other acylphosphatases. PhAcP forms a dimer in the crystal structure via antiparallel association of strand 4. Structural comparison to mesophilic acylphosphatases reveals significant differences in the conformation of the L5 loop connecting strands 4 and 5. The extreme thermostability of PhAcP can be attributed to an extensive ion-pair network consisting of 13 charge residues on the beta sheet of the protein. The reduced catalytic efficiency of PhAcP at 25 degrees C may be due to a less flexible active-site residue, Arg20, which forms a salt bridge to the C-terminal carboxyl group. New insights into catalysis were gained by docking acetyl phosphate to the active site of PhAcP.",

When incubated in various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), HCAII unfolds in two transitions, with an intermediate state at about 1.3 M GuHCl. N-Terminal truncations of 5, 17, or 24 amino acid residues destabilize the native state by 4-5 kcal/mol, relative to the intermediate state, but these amino acid residues have virtually no effect on the stability of the intermediate state relative to the unfolded state. These truncated variants of HCAII still have a high enzymatic activity. Deletion of 28 or more amino acid residues, however, results in inactive enzyme variants. The rates at which the active site is formed are practically unaffected by the removal of the 24-amino acid segment, i.e., the active site forms independently of the N-terminus. By using the tryptophans in positions 5 and 16 as intrinsic probes, we conclude that the structure of the N-terminal region is formed very late in folding. The results strongly indicate that this process is dependent on the prior formation of an enzymatically active native-like structure of the rest of the protein.",

Melting of secondary and tertiary structures of SBP occurs with characteristic transition midpoints, T(m), of 86 and 83.5 degrees C, respectively, at neutral pH. Removal of heme resulted in greatly decreased thermal stability of the protein (T(m) = 38 degrees C).

Comparison with the reported unfolding data of the homologous enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP-C), showed that SBP exhibits significantly high thermal and conformational stability. We show that this enhanced structural stability of SBP relative to HRP-C arises due to the unique nature of their heme binding. A stronger heme-apoprotein affinity probably due to the interaction between Met37 and the C8 heme vinyl substituent contributes to the unusually high structural stability of SBP.",

Our investigation focused on the contribution of chain termini to onconase conformational stability and biological activities. We used differential scanning calorimetry, isothermal unfolding experiments, limited proteolysis, and catalytic and antitumor activity determinations to investigate the effect of the elimination of the two blocks at the chain termini, the N-terminal cyclized glutamine and the C-terminal disulfide bridge between the terminal Cys104 and Cys87. The determination of the thermodynamic parameters of the protein led to the conclusion that the two blocks at onconase chain termini are responsible for the unusual stability of the protein. Moreover, the reduced stability of the onconase mutants does not influence greatly their catalytic and antitumor activities. Thus, our data would suggest that an onconase-based drug, with a decreased toxicity, could be obtained through the use of less stable onconase variants.",

The major transition state for folding was subjected to a Phi-value analysis utilising 50 mutants. The transition state contained a nucleus for folding centred around the end of helix 1 (H1) and the beginning of helix 2 (H2). Secondary structure in this region was fully formed (PhiF=0.9-1) and tertiary interactions were well developed. Interactions in the distal part of the native structure were weak (PhiF=0-0.2). The hydrophobic core and other parts of the protein displayed intermediate Phi-values, suggesting that interactions coalesce as the end of H1 and beginning of H2 are in the process of being formed. The distribution of Phi-values resembled that of barnase, which folds via an intermediate, rather than that of CI2 which folds by a concerted nucleation-condensation mechanism. The overall picture of the transition state structure identified in molecular dynamics simulations is in qualitative agreement, with the turn connecting H1 and H2 being formed, a loosened core, and H4 partially unfolded and detached from the core. There are some differences in the details and interpretation of specific Phi-values.",

Point mutations in the neuroserpin gene underlie the autosomal dominant dementia, familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies. This is characterized by the retention of ordered polymers of neuroserpin within the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons. pH has been shown to affect the propensity of several serpins to form polymers. In particular, low pH favors the formation of polymers of both alpha(1)-antitrypsin and antithrombin. We report here opposite effects in neuroserpin, with a striking resistance to polymer formation at acidic pH. Mutation of specific histidine residues showed that this effect is not attributable to the shutter domain histidine as would be predicted by analogy with other serpins. Indeed, mutation of the shutter domain His338 decreased neuroserpin stability but had no effect on the pH dependence of polymerization when compared with the wild-type protein. In contrast, mutation of His119 or His138 reduced the polymerization of neuroserpin at both acidic and neutral pH. These residues are at the lower pole of neuroserpin and provide a novel mechanism to control the opening of beta-sheet A and hence polymerization. This mechanism is likely to have evolved to protect neuroserpin from the acidic environment of the secretory granules.",

Autonomous heavy chain variable (V(H)H) domains in these molecules have adapted to the absence of the light chain in the following ways: bulky hydrophobic residues replace small aliphatic residues in the former light chain interface, and residues from the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) pack against the framework and stabilize the global V(H)H domain fold. To determine the specific roles of CDR3 residues in framework stabilization, we used nai;ve phage-displayed libraries, combinatorial alanine-scanning mutagenesis and biophysical characterization of purified proteins. Our results indicate that in the most stable scaffolds, the structural residues in CDR3 reside near the boundaries of the loop and pack against the framework to form a small hydrophobic core. These results allow us to differentiate between structural CDR3 residues that should remain fixed, and CDR3 residues that are tolerant to substitution and can therefore be varied to generate functional diversity within phage-displayed libraries. These methods and insights can be applied to the rapid design of heavy chain scaffolds for the identification of novel ligands using synthetic, antibody-phage libraries. In addition, they shed light on the relationships between CDR3 sequence diversity and the structural stability of the V(H)H domain fold.",

        "abstract": "The Trp-cage, as the smallest miniprotein, remains the subject of numerous computational and experimental studies of protein folding dynamics and pathways. The original Trp-cage (NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS, Tm = 42 degrees C) can be significantly stabilized by mutations; melting points as high as 64 degrees C are reported. In helical portions of the structure, each allowed replacement of Leu, Ile, Lys or Ser residues by Ala results in a 1.5 (+/-0.35) kJ/mol fold stabilization. No changes in structure or fluxionality of the core results upon stabilization. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, specific Pro/Trp interactions are not essential for core formation. The entropic advantage of Pro versus Ala (DeltaDeltaS(U) = 11 +/- 2 J/mol K) was measured at the solvent-exposed P17 site. Pro-Ala mutations at two of the three prolines (P12 and P18) that encage the indole ring result in less fold destabilization (2.3-3.4 kJ/mol). However, a P19A mutation reduces fold stability by 16 kJ/mol reflecting a favorable Y3/P19 interaction as well as Trp burial. The Y3/P19 hydrophobic staple interaction defines the folding motif as an 18-residue unit. Other stabilizing features that have been identified include a solvent-exposed Arg/Asp salt bridge (3.4-6 kJ/mol) and a buried H-bonded Ser side chain ( approximately 10 kJ/mol).",

        "abstract": "The thermally induced unfolding of Taka-amylase A, isolated from Aspergillus oryzae, was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The experimental curves of excess apparent specific heat vs. temperature showed a single asymmetric peak. Curve resolution indicated that this asymmetry is due to the two-state unfolding of three domains in the molecule, with dissociation of the single tightly bound Ca2+ ion occurring during the unfolding of the last domain. Further indication of the dissociation of the specifically bound Ca2+ during denaturation is afforded by the fact that the temperature of maximal excess specific heat, tm, increases with increasing protein concentration in the absence of added excess Ca2+ and with increasing Ca2+ concentration in the presence of added Ca2+. Experiments in a variety of buffers with different enthalpies of ionization indicated that 11.8 +/- 1.5 protons are lost from the protein during unfolding at pH 7.0. In apparent contradiction of this result, the value of tm was found to be essentially independent of pH in the range pH 7-8. No explanation of this anomaly is available. The enthalpy of unfolding at pH 7 and 62 degrees C in the absence of added Ca2+, corrected for the change in buffer protonation, is 2250 +/- 40 kJ mol-1 (42.5 J g-1), and the permanent change in apparent heat capacity is 36.4 +/- 4.1 kJ K-1 mol-1 (0.687 J g-1).

        "abstract": "The alpha-helical coiled-coil motif is characterized by a heptad repeat pattern (abcdefg)(n) in which residues a and d form the hydrophobic core. Long coiled-coils (e.g., tropomyosin, 284 residues per polypeptide chain) typically do not have a continuous hydrophobic core of stabilizing residues, but rather one that consists of alternating clusters of stabilizing and destabilizing residues. We have arbitrarily defined a cluster as a minimum of three consecutive stabilizing or destabilizing residues in the hydrophobic core. We report here on a series of two-stranded, disulfide-bridged parallel alpha-helical coiled-coils that contain a central cassette of three consecutive hydrophobic core positions (d, a, and d) with a destabilizing cluster of three consecutive Ala residues in the hydrophobic core on each side of the cassette. The effect of adding one to three stabilizing hydrophobes in these positions (Leu or Ile; denoted as [see text]) was investigated. Alanine residues (denoted as [see text]) are used to represent destabilizing residues. The peptide with three Ala residues in the d a d cassette positions ([see text]) was among the least stable coiled-coil (T(m) = 39.3 degrees C and Urea(1/2) = 1.9 M). Surprisingly, the addition of one stabilizing hydrophobe (Leu) to the cassette or two stabilizing hydrophobes (Leu), still interspersed by an Ala in the cassette ([see text]), also did not lead to any gain in stability. However, peptides with two adjacent hydrophobes in the cassette ([see text])([see text]) did show a gain in stability of 0.9 kcal/mole over the peptide with two interspersed hydrophobes ([see text]). Because the latter three peptides have the same inherent hydrophobicity, the juxtaposition of stabilizing hydrophobes leads to a synergistic effect, and thus a clustering effect. The addition of a third stabilizing hydrophobe to the cassette ([see text]) resulted in a further synergistic gain in stability of 1.7 kcal/mole (T(m) = 54.1 degrees C and Urea(1/2) = 3.3M). Therefore, the role of hydrophobicity in the hydrophobic core of coiled-coils is extremely context dependent and clustering is an important aspect of protein folding and stability.",

In the absence of a stabilizing polyanion, the apparent free energy of unfolding of aFGF is 6.5 kcal mol-1. The presence of equimolar or greater amounts of heparin stabilizes aFGF from unfolding by more than 2.5 kcal mol-1 and slows the rate of unfolding by greater than 2000-fold. The ability of heparin to stabilize aFGF is critically dependent upon many factors including the number of aFGF molecules bound to the heparin chain, ionic strength, temperature, and the extent of sulfation of the polysaccharide. The presence of similar amounts of other polyanions such as sulfated beta-cyclodextrin or heparan sulfate also stabilizes aFGF to a similar extent as heparin. Additional experiments demonstrate that increasing charge density enhances the ability of polyanions such as sulfated beta-cyclodextrins, phosphorylated inositols, and modified heparins to protect aFGF from urea-induced unfolding.",

        "abstract": "The neurotrophins are a family of small dimeric proteins required for the development and survival of vertebrate neurons. Solvent denaturation studies were used to compare recombinant human nerve growth factor (hNGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5) to nerve growth factor isolated from mouse submaxillary glands (mNGF). Although greater than 50% sequence identity is conserved among this family, significant structural differences were revealed by the folding and unfolding of these proteins. Denaturation in guanidine hydrochloride and renaturation at pH 7 and 3.5 were monitored by fluorescence intensity, fluorescence polarization, and circular dichroism. The midpoint of equilibrium unfolding curves for all four neurotrophins was independent of the technique but was dependent on protein concentration, indicating that a two-state model involving native neurotrophin dimers and denatured neurotrophin monomers (N2 = 2D) describes the equilibrium between folded and unfolded neurotrophins. The conformational stabilities of the dimeric neurotrophins revealed that mNGF had the lowest conformational stability (19.3 kcal/mol); hNGF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 had intermediate stabilities, and BDNF had the highest stability (26.4 kcal/mol). Recovery of native spectroscopic characteristics upon removal of denaturant indicated that the unfolding process is reversible. Accordingly, unfolding and refolding curves were coincident for mNGF or NT-4/5 at pH 7 and 3.5 and for BDNF at pH 3.5. However, BDNF and NT-3 unfolding and refolding curves were not coincident at pH 7. The stability of the neurotrophins decreased as pH decreased, with compact monomeric intermediates (N2 = [2I] = 2D) becoming populated below pH 4. The differences in stability, pH dependence, and coincidence of refolding curves distinguish the homologous structures of the neurotrophins.",

        "abstract": "Here we present a method for determining the inference of non-native conformations in the folding of a small domain, alpha-spectrin Src homology 3 domain. This method relies on the preservation of all native interactions after Tyr/Phe exchanges in solvent-exposed, contact-free positions. Minor changes in solvent exposure and free energy of the denatured ensemble are in agreement with the reverse hydrophobic effect, as the Tyr/Phe mutations slightly change the polypeptide hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. Interestingly, more important Gibbs energy variations are observed in the transition state ensemble (TSE). Considering the small changes induced by the H/OH replacements, the observed energy variations in the TSE are rather notable, but of a magnitude that would remain undetected under regular mutations that alter the folded structure free energy. Hydrophobic residues outside of the folding nucleus contribute to the stability of the TSE in an unspecific nonlinear manner, producing a significant acceleration of both unfolding and refolding rates, with little effect on stability. These results suggest that sectors of the protein transiently reside in non-native areas of the landscape during folding, with implications in the reading of phi values from protein engineering experiments. Contrary to previous proposals, the principle that emerges is that non-native contacts, or conformations, could be beneficial in evolution and design of some fast folding proteins.",

Conventional analysis of GdnHCl unfolding exhibits a linear plot of unfolding delta G vs [GdnHCl] in the transition zone. In order to extend unfolding delta G measurements outside of that narrow concentration range, thermal unfolding measurements were performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the presence of low to moderate concentrations of GdnHCl. The unfolding delta G values from the DSC measurements were corrected to 25 degrees C using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation and mapped onto the delta G vs [GdnHCl] plot. The dependence of unfolding delta G on [GdnHCl] was found to be linear over the full denaturant concentration range, provided that the chloride ion concentration was kept at a threshold of greater than or equal to 1.5 M. In the DSC experiments performed in the presence of GdnHCl, chloride concentrations were maintained at 1.5 M by addition of appropriate amounts of NaCl. The linear extrapolation method (LEM) gives an unfolding free energy change in the absence of denaturant (delta G degrees N-U) in excellent agreement with the delta G determined by DSC measurement in 1.5 M NaCl. The various methods give a consensus unfolding delta G value of 8.0 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C in the absence of denaturant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The mechanism that renders collagen molecules more stable when precipitated as fibers than the same molecules in solution is controversial. According to the polymer-melting mechanism the presence of a solvent depresses the melting point of the polymer due to a thermodynamic mechanism resembling the depression of the freezing point of a solvent due to the presence of a solute. On the other hand, according to the polymer-in-a-box mechanism, the change in configurational entropy of the collagen molecule on denaturation is reduced by its confinement by surrounding molecules in the fiber. Both mechanisms predict an approximately linear increase in the reciprocal of the denaturation temperature with the volume fraction (epsilon) of solvent, but the polymer-melting mechanism predicts that the slope is inversely proportional to the molecular mass of the solvent (M), whereas the polymer-in-a-box mechanism predicts a slope that is independent of M. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the denaturation temperature of collagen in different concentrations of ethylene glycol (M = 62) and the slope found to be (7.29 +/- 0.37) x 10(-4) K(-1), compared with (7.31 +/- 0.42) x 10(-4) K(-1) for water (M = 18). This behavior was consistent with the polymer-in-a-box mechanism but conflicts with the polymer-melting mechanism. Calorimetry showed that the enthalpy of denaturation of collagen fibers in ethylene glycol was high, varied only slowly within the glycol volume fraction range 0.2 to 1, and fell rapidly at low epsilon. That this was caused by the disruption of a network of hydrogen-bonded glycol molecules surrounding the collagen is the most likely explanation.",

We investigated the effect of the disaccharides, trehalose and sucrose, on the thermal stability and conformation of bromelain.

The average Tm values as determined by UV spectroscopy and CD spectropolarimetry decreased by 5 degrees and 7 degrees C for bromelain in 1 M sucrose or trehalose solutions, respectively. The enzyme was also found to inactivate faster at 60 degrees C in the presence of these osmolytes. The tertiary and secondary structure of bromelain undergoes small changes in the presence of sucrose/trehalose. Studies on the binding of these osmolytes with the native and the heat denatured enzyme revealed that sucrose/trehalose lead to preferential hydration of the denatured bromelain as compared to the native one, hence stabilizing more the denatured conformation.

With the aim of learning fundamental aspects of protein folding from the close comparison of so similar proteins, the folding process of HypF-N has been studied using stopped-flow fluorescence. While mAcP and ctAcP fold in a two-state fashion, HypF-N was found to collapse into a partially folded intermediate before reaching the fully folded conformation. Formation of a burst-phase intermediate is indicated by the roll over in the Chevron plot at low urea concentrations and by the large jump of intrinsic and 8-anilino-1-naphtalenesulphonic acid-derived fluorescence immediately after removal of denaturant. Furthermore, HypF-N was found to fold rapidly with a rate constant that is approximately two and three orders of magnitudes faster than ctAcP and mAcP, respectively. Differences between the bacterial protein and the two human counterparts were also found as to the involvement of proline isomerism in their respective folding processes. The results clearly indicate that features that are often thought to be relevant in protein folding are not highly conserved in the evolution of the acylphosphatase superfamily. The large difference in folding rate between mAcP and HypF-N cannot be entirely accounted for by the difference in relative contact order or related topological metrics. The analysis shows that the higher folding rate of HypF-N is in part due to the relatively high hydrophobic content of this protein. This conclusion, which is also supported by the highly significant correlation found between folding rate and hydrophobic content within a group of proteins displaying the topology of HypF-N and AcPs, suggests that the average hydrophobicity of a protein sequence is an important determinant of its folding rate.",

Although its recombinant version (rEPO) has been widely used for treatment of various anemias and its biological effects are relatively well-known, we know little about its biophysical properties and their relation to its structure. To gain a fuller understanding of the structural and functional properties of rEPO on the molecular level we followed its thermal and urea-induced unfolding at different pH (3.1-9.4) and urea concentrations (0-8 M) using spectropolarimetry, UV absorption, intrinsic emission fluorescence, and differential scanning calorimetry. Our results show that under a variety of conditions rEPO undergoes thermal or urea-induced denaturation that may be considered as a reversible two-state process characterized by unusually high (thermal) or moderate (urea-induced) extent of the residual structure. The highest thermal stability of the protein observed in aqueous solutions at physiological pH appears to be due to the largest difference in the extent of structure in the denatured and native state at this pH. The comparison between experimentally determined energetics of rEPO denaturation and its structure-based calculations indicates that the parametrization of thermodynamic quantities in terms of changes in solvent accessible nonpolar and polar surface areas resulting from protein unfolding can be successfully used provided that these changes are estimated from combination of experimentally determined deltaC(o)p and deltaH(o) values and not calculated from the structure of the protein's folded and assumingly fully unfolded state.",

In contrast to native pepsin, this form of the enzyme can be reversibly unfolded by urea in a rapid, cooperative reaction. Since all of pepsin's sequence is present in its precursor pepsinogen, it is likely that this neutral structure is present in one or more of the transient intermediates previously detected in the reversible unfolding reaction of the zymogen.

        "abstract": "In this work we compare the dynamics and conformational stability of Pseudomonas mendocina lipase enzyme and its F180P/S205G mutant that shows higher activity and stability for use in washing powders. Our NMR analyses indicate virtually identical structures but reveal remarkable differences in local dynamics, with striking correspondence between experimental data (i.e., (15)N relaxation and H/D exchange rates) and data from Molecular Dynamics simulations. While overall the cores of both proteins are very rigid on the pico- to nanosecond timescale and are largely protected from H/D exchange, the two point mutations stabilize helices alpha1, alpha4, and alpha5 and locally destabilize the H-bond network of the beta-sheet (beta7-beta9). In particular, it emerges that helix alpha5, undergoing some fast destabilizing motions (on the pico- to nanosecond timescale) in wild-type lipase, is substantially rigidified by the mutation of Phe180 for a proline at its N terminus. This observation could be explained by the release of some penalizing strain, as proline does not require any \"N-capping\" hydrogen bond acceptor in the i+3 position. The combined experimental and simulated data thus indicate that reduced molecular flexibility of the F180P/S205G mutant lipase underlies its increased stability, and thus reveals a correlation between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic thermodynamic properties. This could contribute to the observed altered enzyme activity, as may be inferred from recent studies linking enzyme kinetics to their local molecular dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is markedly stabilized by heparin. Partially due to the heterogeneity of heparin preparations, the nature of the aFGF polyanion binding site is still ill-defined. We have, therefore, investigated a wide variety of well-defined polyanions in terms of their ability to stabilize human recombinant aFGF (15-154) against thermal denaturation. The specificity of the interaction between aFGF and polyanions is shown to be remarkably weak with a surprising number of polyanions (including small phosphorylated and sulfated compounds as well as highly charged biopolymers) able to induce physical stability. Temperature-dependent fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements show that many of these polyanionic compounds stabilize aFGF to the same extent as heparin. The ability of these agents to protect the three free thiol groups of aFGF from copper-catalyzed oxidation was also explored and significant protection was observed. The extent and electrostatic requirements of the protein's polyanion binding site were probed by the use of a series of well-defined heparin fragments and differentially phosphorylated inositol compounds. A tetrasaccharide fragment of heparin is the smallest unit of heparin capable of stabilizing aFGF against thermal denaturation. Increasing phosphorylation of inositol compounds (up to six phosphate groups per molecule) enhances the thermal stability of aFGF. These results are discussed in the context of a model of human aFGF based on the X-ray crystal structure of the bovine protein and previous studies by others of the heparin binding site of both acidic and basic FGF.",

        "abstract": "Electrostatic contributions to the conformational stability of apoflavodoxin were studied by measurement of the proton and salt-linked stability of this highly acidic protein with urea and temperature denaturation. Structure-based calculations of electrostatic Gibbs free energy were performed in parallel over a range of pH values and salt concentrations with an empirical continuum method. The stability of apoflavodoxin was higher near the isoelectric point (pH 4) than at neutral pH. This behavior was captured quantitatively by the structure-based calculations. In addition, the calculations showed that increasing salt concentration in the range of 0 to 500 mM stabilized the protein, which was confirmed experimentally. The effects of salts on stability were strongly dependent on cationic species: K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+) exerted similar effects, much different from the effect measured in the presence of the bulky choline cation. Thus cations bind weakly to the negatively charged surface of apoflavodoxin. The similar magnitude of the effects exerted by different cations indicates that their hydration shells are not disrupted significantly by interactions with the protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues and the analysis of truncation variants indicate that cation binding is not site-specific and that the cation-binding regions are located in the central region of the protein sequence. Three-state analysis of the thermal denaturation indicates that the equilibrium intermediate populated during thermal unfolding is competent to bind cations. The unusual increase in the stability of apoflavodoxin at neutral pH affected by salts is likely to be a common property among highly acidic proteins.",

        "abstract": "The effects of terminal ion pairs on the stability of a beta-hairpin peptide corresponding to the C-terminal residues of the B1 domain of protein G were determined using thermal unfolding as monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also performed to examine the effect of ion pairs on the structures. Eight peptides were studied including the wild type (G41) and the N-terminal modified sequences that had the first residue deleted (E42), replaced with a Lys (K41), or extended by an additional Gly (G40). Acetylated variants were made to examine the effect of removing the positive N-terminal charge on beta-hairpin stability. The rank in stability determined experimentally is K41 > E42 approximately G41 approximately G40 > Ac-K41 > Ac-E42 approximately Ac-G41 > Ac-G40. The Tm of the K41 peptide is 12 degrees C higher than G41, while the Tm values for the acetylated peptides are less than their unacetylated forms by more than 15 degrees C. NOE cross-peaks between side-chain methylene groups at the N- and C-termini and larger CalphaH shifts compared to random values are seen for K41. The addition of 20% methanol increases the stability in K41 and G41. The MD studies complement these results by showing that the charged N-terminus is important to stability. The type of ion pair observed varies with peptide, and when formed the simulations show that the ion pair can prevent fraying of the beta-strands through electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts. Therefore, introducing favorable electrostatic interactions at the N- and C-termini can substantially enhance beta-hairpin stability and help define the structure.",

        "abstract": "Endostatin is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. The structure of endostatin is unique in that its secondary structure is mainly irregular loops and beta-sheets and contains only a small fraction of alpha-helices with two pairs of disulfide bonds in a nested pattern. We choose human endostatin as a model system to study the folding mechanism of this kind. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tryptophan emission fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) were used to monitor the unfolding process of endostatin upon acid titration. Urea-induced unfolding was used to measure the stability of endostatin under different conditions. Our results show that endostatin is very acid-resistant; some native structure still remains even at pH 2 as evidenced by (1)H NMR. Trifluoroethanol (TFE) destabilizes native endostatin, while it makes endostatin even more acid-resistant in the low pH region. Stability measurement of endostatin suggests that endostatin is still in native structure at pH 3.5 despite the decreased stability. Acid-induced unfolding of endostatin is reversible, although it requires a long time to reach equilibrium below pH 3. Surprisingly, the alpha-helical content of endostatin is increased when it is unfolded at pH 1.6, and the alpha-helical content of the polypeptide chain of unfolded endostatin increases linearly with TFE concentration in the range of 0-30%. This observation indicates that the polypeptide chain of unfolded endostatin has an intrinsic alpha-helical propensity. Our discoveries may provide clues for refolding endostatin more efficiently. The acid-resistance property of endostatin may have biological significance in that it cannot be easily digested by proteases in an acidic environment such as in a lysosome in the cell.",

Enzyme kinetic studies indicate that, despite being structurally remote from the active site, this mutation has significant effects on both the Vmax and Km values for various substrates. The single cysteine residue in the N domain of the protein is markedly more reactive in the mutant, and this enhanced accessibility is moderated by binding of substrates and various anions. Differences are also observed in the near-ultraviolet CD spectra of these proteins. The chemical and thermal stability of the mutant enzyme is reduced, as indicated from guanidinium chloride and differential-scanning calorimetry denaturation studies. Moreover, interdomain interactions seem to be altered in the mutant, resulting in the appearance of independent thermal transition for the two domains, in contrast to the single cooperative transition observed for the wild-type enzyme. The conformational and/or dynamic effects of the mutation on the H388Q enzyme are therefore various and not solely localised in the hinge region.",

Chaffotte, A., Limbourg-Bouchon, B., and V\u00e9ron, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12775-12781). We investigated the role of the equivalent proline (Pro100) in the formation and stability of the Dictyostelium nucleoside diphosphate kinase hexamers. Mutations to serine or glycine had only little effect on the properties of the native enzyme. However, the mutant drastically affected the subunit interaction in the hexamer and the ability of the isolated subunits to associate in vitro. While the wild-type hexamer inactivated and unfolded concomitantly at 5-6 M urea, the mutant proteins dissociated to monomers at 0.5-2 M urea and unfolded at 2.5-4 M urea. At intermediate urea concentrations, the unique species present in solution was a folded, partially active monomer as shown by size-exclusion chromatography, UV, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy. Proline 100 is located in a loop involved in subunits contact. Altered conformation of the loop in P100S and P100S mutants demonstrates its crucial role in subunit assembly. We propose to explain the conditional dominance of the K-pn mutation by the presence of a monomeric form of the enzyme that would have deleterious effects in vivo.",

The native structure of the protein was apparently most stabilized at about 20 degrees C and was denatured upon heating and cooling from this temperature. Each denaturation was reversible and cooperative, proceeding in two-state transitions, that is, from the native state to the cold-denatured state or from the native state to the heat-denatured state. The two denatured states, however, were not perfect random-coiled structures, and they differed from each other, indicating that there exist three states in this temperature range, i.e., cold denatured, native, and heat denatured. The difference between the cold and heat denaturations was indicated first by circular dichroism. The isodichroic point for the transition from the native state to the cold-denatured state was different from that from the native state to the heat-denatured state in the pH range between 3.21 and 2.45. Moreover, molar ellipticity for the cold-denatured state was different from that of the heat-denatured state, and the transition from the former to the latter was observed at pH values below 2. Values of van't Hoff enthalpies from the native state to the heat-denatured state at pH values between 3.21 and 2.45 were obtained by curve fitting of the CD data, and delta Cp = 1.82 (+/- 0.11) [kcal/(mol.K)] was obtained from the linear plot of the enthalpies against temperature. The parameters obtained from the heat denaturation studies gave curves for delta G zero which were not in agreement with the experimental data in the cold denaturation region when extrapolated to the low temperature. Moreover, the value of the apparent delta Cp for the cold denaturation in the pH range 3.03-2.45 was estimated to be different from that for the heat denaturation, indicating that the mechanism of the cold denaturation of SSI is different from a simple cold denaturation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "As part of a larger effort to engineer the stability and hemin-binding properties of microsomal (Mc) cytochromes b(5) into rat liver outer mitochondrial membrane (OM) cytochrome (cyt) b(5), several mutants of rat OM cyt b(5) were prepared to study the effect of gradual and complete elimination of two extended hydrophobic networks, which are present in the structure of the mitochondrial protein and are absent in the structure of mammalian Mc cytochromes b(5). One of the hydrophobic networks, identified in a previous study [Altuve, A., Silchenko, S., Lee, K.-H., Kuczera, K., Terzyan, S., Zhang, X., Benson, D. R., and Rivera, M. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 9469-9483], encompasses the side chains of Ala-18, Ile-32, Leu-36, and Leu-47, whereas a second hydrophobic network, identified as part of this work, encompasses the side chains of Ile-25, Phe-58, Leu-71, and the heme. The X-ray structure of the A18S/I25L/I32L/L47R/L71S quintuple mutant of rat OM cyt b(5) demonstrates that both hydrophobic networks have been eliminated and that the corresponding structural elements of the Mc isoform have been introduced. The stability of the rat OM mutant proteins studied was found to decrease in the order wild type > I25L > A18S/I32L/L47R > L71S > A18S/I32L/L47R/L71S > 18S/I25L/I32L/L47R/L71S, indicating that the two hydrophobic networks do indeed contribute to the high stability of rat OM cyt b(5) relative to the bovine Mc isoform. Surprisingly, the quintuple mutant of rat OM cyt b(5) is less stable than bovine Mc cyt b(5), even though the former exhibits significantly slower rates of hemin release and hemin reorientation at pH 7.0. However, at pH 5.0 the bovine Mc and rat OM quintuple mutant proteins release hemin at comparable rates, suggesting that one or both of the His axial ligands in the rat OM protein are more resistant to protonation under physiological conditions. Results obtained from chemical denaturation experiments conducted with the apoproteins demonstrated that mutants containing L71S are significantly less stable than bovine Mc apocyt b(5), strongly suggesting that Leu-71 plays a pivotal role in the stabilization of rat OM apocyt b(5), presumably via hydrophobic interactions with Ile-25 and Phe-58. Because comparable interactions are absent in bovine Mc apocyt b(5), which contains Ser at position 71, it must resort to different interactions to stabilize its fold, thus highlighting yet another difference between rat OM and bovine Mc cyt b(5). During the course of these investigations we also discovered that rat OM cyt b(5) can be made to strongly favor hemin orientational isomer A (I32L) or isomer B (L71S) with a single point mutation and that release of hemin orientational isomers A and B can be kinetically resolved in certain rat OM mutants.",

It is unknown if the activity-stability trade-offs can be applied to proteins from hyperthermophiles. Because enzymatic activity usually increases at higher temperature and hyperthermophilic proteins need high conformational stability, they might not sacrifice the stability for their activity. This study attempts to clarify the contribution of active-site residues to the conformational stability of a hyperthermophilic protein. We therefore examined the thermodynamic stability and enzymatic activity of wild-type and active-site mutant proteins (D7N, E8A, E8Q, D105A, and D135A) of ribonuclease HII from Thermococcus kodakaraensis (Tk-RNase HII). Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced denaturation was measured with circular dichroism at 220 nm, and heat-induced denaturation was studied with differential scanning calorimetry. Both GdnHCl- and heat-induced denaturation were highly reversible in these proteins. All the mutations of these active-site residues, except that of Glu8 to Gln, reduced the enzymatic activity dramatically but increased the protein stability by 7.0 to 11.1 kJ mol(-1) at 50 degrees C. The mutation of Glu8 to Gln did not seriously affect the enzymatic activity and increased the stability only by 2.5 kJ mol(-1) at 50 degrees C. These results indicate that hyperthermophilic proteins also exhibit the activity-stability trade-offs. Therefore, the architectural mechanism for hyperthermophilic proteins is equivalent to that for proteins at normal temperature.",

Employing an optimized incorporation strategy, the small cold shock protein from the bacterium Thermotoga maritima (TmCsp) was labeled with 5-fluorotryptophan. Although chaotropically induced unfolding transitions revealed a significant decrease in the stabilization free energy upon fluorine labeling, the protein's kinetic folding mechanism is conserved. Temperature- and guanidinium chloride-dependent equilibrium unfolding transitions monitored by (19)F NMR agree well with the results from optical spectroscopy, and provide a stringent test of the two-state folding character of TmCsp. Folding and unfolding rate constants at high temperatures were determined from the (19)F NMR spectra close to the midpoint of thermal unfolding by global line shape analysis. In combination with results from stopped-flow experiments at lower temperatures, they show that the folding rate constant of TmCsp and its temperature dependence closely resemble those of its mesophilic homologue from Bacillus subtilis, BsCspB. However, the unfolding rate constant of TmCsp is two orders of magnitude lower over the entire temperature range that was investigated. Consequently, the difference in conformational stability between the two proteins is solely due to the unfolding rate constant over a wide temperature range. A thermodynamic analysis points to an important role of entropic factors in the stabilization of TmCsp relative to its mesophilic homologues.",

The thermodynamic and binding properties of the immobilized enzyme have been studied and compared with those of the free enzyme. The parameters describing the binding of the inhibitor 3'-CMP (Ka and delta H) as monitored by spectrophotometry and calorimetry were not significantly affected after immobilization. Conversely both the stability and unfolding mechanism drastically changed. Thermodynamic analysis of the DSC data suggests that uncoupling of protein domains has occurred as a consequence of the immobilization. The two state approximation of the protein unfolding process is not longer valid for the immobilized RNase. Protein stability strongly depends on the hydrophobicity properties of the support surface as well as on the presence of the inhibitor and pH. For example, after immobilization on a highly hydrophobic surface, the enzyme is partially in the unfolded state. The binding of a ligand is able to reorganize the protein structure into a native-like conformation. The refolding rates are different for the two protein domains and vary as a function of pH and presence of the inhibitor 3'-CMP.",

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of Lactobacillus confusus L-2-Hydroxyisocaproate Dehydrogenase (L-HicDH) has been studied by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The stability of this enzyme has been investigated at different pH conditions. The results of this study indicate that the thermal denaturation of this enzyme is irreversible and the T(m) is dependent on the scan-rate, which suggests that the denaturation process of L-HicDH is kinetically determined. The heat capacity function of L-HicDH shows a single peak with the T(m) values between 52.14 degrees C and 55.89 degrees C at pH 7.0 at different scan rates. These results indicate that the whole L-HicDH could unfold as a single cooperative unit, and intersubunit interactions of this homotetrameric enzyme must play a significant role in the stabilization of the whole enzyme. The rate constant of the unfolding is analyzed as a first order kinetic constant with the Arrhenius equation, and the activation energy has been calculated. The variation of the activation energy values obtained with different methods does not support the validity of the one-step irreversible model. The denaturation pathway was described by a three-state model, N --> U --> F, in which the dissociation of the tetramer takes place as an irreversible step before the irreversible unfolding of the monomers. The calorimetric enthalpy associated with the irreversible dissociation and the calorimetric enthalpy associated with the unfolding of the monomer were obtained from the best fitting procedure. Thermal unfolding of L-HicDH was also studied using Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Both methods yielded comparable values.",

The results are as follows. (1) The unfolding transition is shifted to higher concentrations of urea by Ca2+ and pdTp, and the presence of both ligands further stabilizes the protein. (2) In the first stage of kinetic refolding, the peptide ellipticity changes rapidly within the dead time of stopped-flow measurement (15 ms), indicating accumulation of a transient intermediate. This intermediate is remarkably less stable than those of other globular proteins previously studied. (3) Dependence of the folding and unfolding rate constants on urea concentration indicates that the critical activated state of folding (\"transition state\") has considerable structural organization. The transition state does not, however, have the capacity to bind Ca2+ and pdTp, as indicated by the effects of these ligands on the unfolding rate constant. (4) There are at least four different phases in the refolding kinetics in native conditions below 1 M urea. In the absence of pdTp, there are two phases in unfolding, while in the presence of pdTp the unfolding kinetics show a single phase.

The denaturation processes proved to be reversible for all proteins, and represented well by the two-state N if D transition model in a wide range of pH. All three mutants are less thermally stable than the parent protein; in particular, in the pH range of 5.0-7.0, the F31A substitution leads to a decrease of 24 degreesC in the denaturation temperature, the F31Y substitution to a decrease of 10 degreesC, and the W23A substitution to a decrease of 6 degreesC.

CD spectra show the characteristics expected for beta-proteins. Lowering the pH to 3.5 reduces the stability, but does not change the conformation.

        "abstract": "Adenosine deaminase (ADA, EC 3.5.4.4) is a ubiquitous (beta/alpha)8-barrel enzyme crucial for purine metabolism and normal immune competence. In this study, it was observed that loss of enzyme activity of murine ADA (mADA) precedes the global secondary and tertiary structure transition when the protein is exposed to denaturant. The structural mechanism for this phenomenon was probed using site-specific 19F NMR spectroscopy in combination with [6-19F]tryptophan labeling and inhibitor binding. There are four tryptophan residues in mADA and all are located more than 12 A from the catalytic site. The 19F NMR spectra of [6-19F]Trp-labelled mADA show that the urea-induced chemical shift change of 19F resonance of W161, one of the four tryptophan 19F nuclei, correlates with the loss of enzyme activity. The urea-induced chemical shift change of another 19F resonance of W117 correlates with the change of the apparent rate constant for the binding of transition-state analogue inhibitor deoxycoformycin to the enzyme. On the other hand, the chemical environment of the local region around W264 does not change significantly, as a consequence of perturbation by low concentrations of urea or substrate analog. The results indicate that different regions of mADA have different local stability, which controls the activity and stability of the enzyme. The results provide new insights into the relationship between the function of a protein and its conformational flexibility as well as its global stability. This study illustrates the advantage of 19F NMR spectroscopy in probing site-related conformational change information in ligand binding, enzymatic activity and protein folding.",

        "abstract": "The pairing of two alpha-helices at opposite ends of the chain is a highly conserved structural motif found throughout the cytochrome c family of proteins. It has previously been shown that association of the N- and C-terminal helices is a critical early event in the folding process of horse cytochrome c and is responsible for the formation of a partially folded intermediate (INC). In order to gain further insight into the structural and energetic basis of helix packing interactions and their role in folding, we prepared a series of horse cytochrome c variants in which Leu94, a critical residue at the helix contact site, was replaced by Ile, Val, or Ala. The Ile and Val substitutions resulted in minor changes in the stability of the native state, indicating that conservative mutations can be accommodated at the helix interface with only minor structural perturbations. In contrast, the L94A mutation resulted in a 3.5 kcal/mol decrease in unfolding free energy, suggesting that the smaller Ala side chain causes severe packing defects at the helix interface. The effect of these mutations on the kinetics of folding and unfolding as a function of denaturant concentration was studied by a systematic series of stopped-flow fluorescence measurements. The proteins with Leu, Ile, or Val at position 94 exhibit a major unresolved fluorescence change during the 1-ms dead time of the stopped-flow refolding measurements, while this effect is less pronounced in L94A, indicating that the rapid formation of a compact state (IC) with largely quenched Trp59 fluorescence is favored by a large hydrophobic side chain at the helix-helix interface. Despite their small effects on overall stability, the L94I and L94V mutations result in a substantial reduction in the relative amplitude of the fastest observable folding phase (formation of INC) consistent with a strong decrease in the population of INC compared to the wild-type protein. This effect is amplified in the case of the destabilizing L94A variant, which exhibits slower folding kinetics and negligible accumulation of INC. Whereas the presence of a large hydrophobic side chain at position 94 is sufficient for the stabilization of IC, the subsequent partially folded intermediate, INC, is stabilized by specific interactions that are responsible for the proper packing of the two alpha-helices.",

        "abstract": "The eukaryotic nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinases are hexamers, while the bacterial NDP kinases are tetramers made of small, single domain subunits. These enzymes represent an ideal model for studying the effect of subunit interaction on protein stability. The thermostability of NDP kinases of each class was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and biochemical methods. The hexameric NDP kinase from Dictyostelium discoideum displays one single, irreversible differential scanning calorimetry peak (Tm 62 degrees C) over a broad protein concentration, indicating a single step denaturation. The thermal stability of the protein was increased by ADP. The P105G substitution, which affects a loop implicated in subunit contacts, yields a protein that reversibly dissociates to folded monomers at 38 degrees C before the irreversible denaturation occurs (Tm 47 degrees C). ADP delays the dissociation, but does not change the Tm. These data indicate a \"coupling\" of the quaternary structure with the tertiary structure in the wild-type, but not in the mutated protein. We describe the x-ray structure of the P105G mutant at 2.2-A resolution. It is very similar to that of the wild-type protein. Therefore, a minimal change in the structure leads to a dramatic change of protein thermostability. The NDP kinase from Escherichia coli behaves like the P105G mutant of the Dictyostelium NDP kinase. The detailed study of their thermostability is important, since biological effects of thermolabile NDP kinases have been described in several organisms.",

        "abstract": "Earlier thermodynamic studies of the intermolecular interactions between mature oxytocin and neurophysin, and of the effects of these interactions on neurophysin folding, raised questions about the intramolecular interactions of oxytocin with neurophysin within their common precursor. To address this issue, the disulfide-rich precursor of oxytocin-associated bovine neurophysin was expressed in Escherichia coli and folded in vitro to yield milligram quantities of purified protein; evidence of significant impediments to yield resulting from damage to Cys residues is presented. The inefficiency associated with the refolding of reduced mature neurophysin in the presence of oxytocin was found not to be alleviated in the precursor. Consistent with this, the effects of pH on the spectroscopic properties of the precursor and on the relative stabilities of the precursor and mature neurophysin to guanidine denaturation indicated that noncovalent intramolecular bonding between oxytocin and neurophysin in the precursor had only a small thermodynamic advantage over the corresponding bonding in the intermolecular complex. Loss of the principal interactions between hormone and protein, and of the enhanced stability of the precursor relative to that of the mature unliganded protein, occurred reversibly upon increasing the pH, with a midpoint at pH 10. Correlation of these results with evidence from NMR studies of structural differences between the precursor and the intermolecular complex, which persist beyond the pH 10 transition, suggests that the covalent attachment of the hormone in the precursor necessitates a conformational change in its neurophysin segment and leads to properties of the system that are distinct from those of either the liganded or unliganded mature protein.",

        "abstract": "The N-terminal SH3 domain of the Drosophila drk protein (drkN SH3) exists in equilibrium between folded and unfolded states under non-denaturing buffer conditions. In order to examine the origins of this instability, we have made mutations in the domain and characterized the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding. Results of substitutions of negatively charged residues to neutral amino acid residues suggest that the large electrostatic potential of the domain does not play a dominant role in the instability of the domain. Sequence alignment of a large number of SH3 domains reveals that the drkN SH3 domain has a threonine (T22) at a position corresponding to an otherwise highly conserved glycine residue in the diverging beta-turn connecting the beta3 and beta4 strands. Mutation of T22 to glycine results in significant stabilization of the drkN SH3 domain by 2.5 kcal/mole. To further characterize the basis for the stabilization of the T22 mutant relative to wild-type, we made additional mutant proteins with substitutions of residue T22. A strong correlation is seen between protein stability or folding rate and propensity for native beta-turn structure at this position. Correlation of folding rates with AGADIR predictions of non-native helical structure in the diverging turn region, along with our previous NMR evidence for non-native structure in this region of the unfolded state of the drkN SH3 domain, suggests that the free energy of the unfolded state also plays a role in stability.

        "abstract": "Thioredoxin contains a single disulfide bond that can be reduced without perturbing significantly the structure of the enzyme. Upon reduction of the disulfide, protein stability decreases. We have experimentally tested the expected linkage relationship between disulfide bond formation and protein stability for thioredoxin. In order to do this, it is necessary to measure the equilibrium constant for disulfide bond formation in both the folded and unfolded states of the protein. Using glutathione as a reference species, we have measured the equilibrium constant for forming the disulfide bond (effective concentration) in thioredoxin as a function of urea concentration. As a control, we show that urea per se does not interfere with our measurements of thiol-disulfide equilibrium constants. Comparison of the values obtained for disulfide bond formation in the folded and unfolded states with the free energies for unfolding oxidized and reduced thioredoxin using circular dichroism confirms the expected linkage relationship. The urea dependence of thiol-disulfide equilibria provides a sensitive assay for folded structure in peptides or proteins. The method should also be useful to evaluate the stabilizing or destabilizing effect of natural or genetically engineered disulfides in proteins. In future work, the effects of amino acid substitutions on disulfide bond formation could be evaluated individually in the native and unfolded states of a protein.",

The results show that the far-UV CD spectra of rM179 at acidic pH and 10 degrees C are different from the spectra of random coil in 6 M GdnHCl. A near-UV CD spectrum of rM179 at 10 degrees C is similar to that of rM179 in 6 M GdnHCl, which indicates that aromatic residues of native structure are exposed to solvent and rotate freely. Far-UV CD values of rM179 at 80 degrees C are different from that of random-coil structure in 6 M GdnHCl, which suggests that rM179 at 80 degrees C has specific secondary structures. A gradual thermal transition was observed by far-UV CD, which is interpreted as a weak cooperative transition from specific secondary structures to other specific secondary structures. The fluorescence emission maximum for the spectrum due to Trp residues in rM179 at 10 degrees C shows the same fluorescence emission maximum as rM179 in 6 M GdnHCl and amino acid Trp, which indicates that the three Trp in rM179 are exposed to solvent. Deconvolution of differential scanning calorimetry curve gives the population of three states (A, I, and C states). These results indicate that three states (A, I, and C) have specific secondary structures, in which hydrophobic and Trp residues are exposed to the solvent.

        "abstract": "The cold-shock protein CspB from Bacillus subtilis is a very small beta-barrel protein, which folds with a time constant of 1 ms (at 25 degrees C) in a U reversible N two-state reaction. To elucidate the energetics of this extremely fast reaction we investigated the folding kinetics of CspB as a function of both temperature and denaturant concentration between 2 and 45 degrees C and between 1 and 8 M urea. Under all these conditions unfolding and refolding were reversible monoexponential reactions. By using transition state theory, data from 327 kinetic curves were jointly analyzed to determine the thermodynamic activation parameters delta H H2O++, delta S H2O++, delta G H2O++, and delta C p H2O++ for unfolding and refolding and their dependences on the urea concentration. 90% of the total change in heat capacity and 96% of the change in the m value (m = d delta G/d[urea]) occur between the unfolded state and the activated state. This suggests that for CspB the activated state of folding is unusually well structured and almost equivalent to the native protein in its interactions with the solvent. As a consequence of this native-like activated state a strong temperature-dependent enthalpy/entropy compensation is observed for the refolding kinetics, and the barrier to refolding shifts from being largely enthalpic at low temperature to largely entropic at high temperature. This shift originates not from the changes in the folding protein chains itself, but from the changes in the protein-solvent interactions. We speculate that the absence of intermediates and the native-like activated state in the folding of CspB are correlated with the small size and the structural type of this protein. The stabilization of a small beta-sheet as in CspB requires extensive non-local interactions, and therefore incomplete sheets are unstable. As a consequence, the critical activated state is reached only very late in folding. The instability of partially folded structure is a means to avoid misfolding prior to the rate-limiting step, and a native-like activated state reduces the risk of non-productive side reactions during the final steps to the native state.",

        "abstract": "Alpha(1)-antitrypsin, a protein belonging to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, is characterized by the ability to undergo dramatic conformational changes leading to inactive polymers. Serpin polymerization, which causes a range of diseases such as emphysema, thrombosis and dementia, occurs through a process in which the reactive center loop residues of one serpin molecule insert into the A beta-sheet of another. PoPMuSiC, a program that uses database-derived mean force potentials to predict changes in folding free energy resulting from single-site mutations, was used to modulate rationally the polymerization propensity of alpha(1)-antitrypsin. This was accomplished by generating mutants with a stabilized active form and destabilized polymerized form, or the converse. Of these mutants, five were expressed and characterized experimentally. In agreement with the predictions, three of them, K331F, K331I and K331V, were shown to stabilize the active form and decrease the polymerization rate, and one of them, S330R, to destabilize the active form and to increase polymerization. Only one mutant (K331T) did not display the expected behavior. Thus, strikingly, the adjacent positions 330 and 331, which are located at the beginning of the beta-strand next to the additionally inserted beta-strand in the polymerized form, have opposite effects on the conformational change. These residues therefore appear to play a key role in inducing or preventing such conformational change.",

        "abstract": "Soybean agglutinin (gSBA) is a tetrameric legume lectin, each of whose subunits are glycosylated. Earlier studies have shown that this protein shows exceptionally high stability in terms of free energy of unfolding when compared to other proteins from the same family. This article deals with the unfolding reactions of the nonglycosylated recombinant form of the protein rSBA and its comparison with the glycosylated counterpart gSBA. The nonglycosylated form features a lower stability when compared to the glycosylated form. Further, the unfolding pathways in the two are widely different. Although the glycosylated form undergoes a simple two-state unfolding, the nonglycosylated species unfolds via a compact monomeric intermediate that is not a molten globule. Representative isothermal and thermal denaturation profiles show that glycosylation accounts for a stabilization of approximately 9 kcal/mol of the tetramer, whereas the difference in T(m) between the two forms is 26 degrees C. Computational studies on the glycan-protein interactions at the noncanonical interface of the protein show that quite a number of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions stabilize the glycoprotein tetramer.",

Here, to examine the influence of confinement on protein stability we choose four test cases of single domain proteins characterized by a wide range of melting temperatures, from approximately 73 degrees C of titin I27 to approximately 36 degrees C of yeast frataxin. All proteins are stabilized when confined in the gel, the most dramatic stabilization being that of yeast frataxin, whose melting temperature increased by almost 5 degrees C in the gel. In addition to being simple to use, this approach allows us to change the viscosity of the solvent without changing its composition or altering the structure of the proteins. The dimensions of the pores of the gels fall in the nanometer range, hence they are similar to those of the chaperone cavity. This method could therefore be used as a novel and powerful approach for protein folding studies.",

        "abstract": "There are great demands on the stability, expression yield and resistance to aggregation of antibody fragments. To untangle intrinsic domain effects from domain interactions, we present first a systematic evaluation of the isolated human immunoglobulin variable heavy (V(H)) and light (V(L)) germline family consensus domains and then a systematic series of V(H)-V(L) combinations in the scFv format. The constructs were evaluated in terms of their expression behavior, oligomeric state in solution and denaturant-induced unfolding equilibria under non-reducing conditions. The seven V(H) and seven V(L) domains represent the consensus sequences of the major human germline subclasses, derived from the Human Combinatorial Antibody Library (HuCAL). The isolated V(H) and V(L) domains with the highest thermodynamic stability and yield of soluble protein were V(H)3 and V(kappa)3, respectively. Similar measurements on all domain combinations in scFv fragments allowed the scFv fragments to be classified according to thermodynamic stability and in vivo folding yield. The scFv fragments containing the variable domain combinations H3kappa3, H1bkappa3, H5kappa3 and H3kappa1 show superior properties concerning yield and stability. Domain interactions diminish the intrinsic differences of the domains. ScFv fragments containing V(lambda) domains show high levels of stability, even though V(lambda) domains are surprisingly unstable by themselves. This is due to a strong interaction with the V(H) domain and depends on the amino acid sequence of the CDR-L3. On the basis of these analyses and model structures, we suggest possibilities for further improvement of the biophysical properties of individual frameworks and give recommendations for library design.",

        "abstract": "The origin of reduced heat capacity change of unfolding (DeltaC(p)) commonly observed in thermophilic proteins is controversial. The established theory that DeltaC(p) is correlated with change of solvent-accessible surface area cannot account for the large differences in DeltaC(p) observed for thermophilic and mesophilic homologous proteins, which are very similar in structures. We have determined the protein stability curves, which describe the temperature dependency of the free energy change of unfolding, for a thermophilic ribosomal protein L30e from Thermococcus celer, and its mesophilic homologue from yeast. Values of DeltaC(p), obtained by fitting the free energy change of unfolding to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, were 5.3 kJ mol(-1) K(-1) and 10.5 kJ mol(-1) K(-1) for T.celer and yeast L30e, respectively. We have created six charge-to-neutral mutants of T.celer L30e. Removal of charges at Glu6, Lys9, and Arg92 decreased the melting temperatures of T.celer L30e by approximately 3-9 degrees C, and the differences in melting temperatures were smaller with increasing concentration of salt. These results suggest that these mutations destabilize T.celer L30e by disrupting favorable electrostatic interactions. To determine whether electrostatic interactions contribute to the reduced DeltaC(p) of the thermophilic protein, we have determined DeltaC(p) for wild-type and mutant T.celer L30e by Gibbs-Helmholtz and by van't Hoff analyses. A concomitant increase in DeltaC(p) was observed for those charge-to-neutral mutants that destabilize T.celer L30e by removing favorable electrostatic interactions. The crystal structures of K9A, E90A, and R92A, were determined, and no structural change was observed. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that electrostatic interactions contribute to the reduced DeltaC(p) of T.celer L30e.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding equilibrium of the C-terminal domain of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) capsid protein has been analyzed by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results for the dimeric, natural domain are consistent with a three-state model (N(2)<-->2I<-->2U). The dimer (N(2)) dissociates and partially unfolds in a coupled cooperative process, into a monomeric intermediate (I) of very low conformational stability. This intermediate, which is the only significantly populated form at low (1 microM) protein concentrations, fully preserves the secondary structure but has lost part of the tertiary (intramonomer) interactions found in the dimer. In a second transition, the intermediate cooperatively unfolds into denatured monomer (U). The latter process is the equivalent of a two-state unfolding transition observed for a monomeric domain in which Trp184 at the dimer interface had been truncated to Ala. A highly conserved, disulfide-bonded cysteine, but not the disulfide bond itself, and three conserved residues within the major homology region of the retroviral capsid are important for the conformational stability of the monomer. All these residues are involved also in the association process, despite being located far away from the dimerization interface. It is proposed that dimerization of the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein involves induced-fit recognition, and the conformational reorganization also improves substantially the low intrinsic stability of each monomeric half.",

        "abstract": "In order to determine the thermodynamic cost of introducing a polar group within the core of a protein, a series of nine Ala-->Ser and 3 Val-->Thr substitutions was constructed in T4 lysozyme. The sites were all within alpha-helices but ranged from fully solvent-exposed to totally buried. The range of destabilization incurred by the Ala-->Ser substitutions was found to be very similar to that for the Val-->Thr replacements. For the solvent-exposed and partly exposed sites the destabilization was modest (approximately less than 0.5 kcal/mol). For the completely buried sites the destabilization was larger, but variable (approximately 1-3 kcal/mol). Crystal structure determinations showed that the Ala-->Ser mutant structures were, in general, very similar to their wild-type counterparts, even though the replacements introduce a hydroxyl group. This is in part because the introduced serines are all within alpha-helices and at congested sites can avoid steric clashes with surrounding atoms by making a hydrogen bond to a backbone carbonyl oxygen in the preceding turn of the helix. The three substituted threonine side chains essentially superimpose on their valine counterparts but display somewhat larger conformational adjustments. The results illustrate how a protein structure will adapt in different ways to avoid the presence of an unsatisfied hydrogen bond donor or acceptor. In the most extreme case, Val 149-->Thr, which is also the most destabilizing variant (delta delta G = 2.8 kcal/mol), a water molecule is incorporated in the mutant structure in order to provide a hydrogen-bonding partner. The results are consistent with the view that many hydrogen bonds within proteins contribute only marginally to stability but that noncharged polar groups that lack a hydrogen-bonding partner are very destabilizing (delta delta G approximately greater than 3 kcal/mol). Supportive of other studies, the alpha-helix propensity of alanine is seen to be higher than that of serine (delta delta G = 0.46 +/- 0.04 kcal/mol), while threonine and valine are similar in alpha-helix propensity.",

We analyze the kinetics and equilibria of association of mutant fragments derived from cleaving mutant proteins at the same methionine residue. The changes in free energy of association have been measured both from isothermal studies of the binding of fragments and from thermal denaturation of the complexes. In general, there is a good correlation between the changes on mutation of the free energy of association of fragments and the changes in free energy of folding of the uncleaved parent protein. The notable exceptions are for residues in regions of the fragments that form nonnative hydrophobic clusters in the isolated fragments; mutation of the hydrophobic residues involved in these clusters decreases the equilibrium constant for formation of the noncovalent complex less than it does the equilibrium constant for folding of intact protein. The dissociated fragments must be destabilized by mutation of those hydrophobic residues, but to a lesser extent than is the complex itself. These clusters are thus less important energetically in the denatured state of the intact protein. The second-order rate constants for the major phase of association change with mutation, similar results being obtained from fluorescence measurements of the regain of tertiary structure and from circular dichroism measurements of the regain of secondary structure.

        "abstract": "The thermal stability of a 56 amino acid fragment of GCN4 has been studied by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. This fragment contains the leucine zipper and part of the basic region. The thermal unfolding of GCN4-56 is a reversible process and can be well represented by a reaction of the form N2<-->2U, indicating that the unfolding of the leucine zipper is a two-state process in which the helices are only stable when they are in the coiled-coil conformation. As expected, the transition temperature is concentration dependent. At pH 7.06 and a protein concentration of 5 x 10(-4) M the transition temperature is close to 70 degrees C while at 5 x 10(-6) M it is close to 50 degrees C. The enthalpy change for unfolding is 31.5 kcal mol-1 at 70 degrees C. Since the isolated helices are unstable, interactions at the interface between the two helices play a key role in the stabilization of the native dimer. These interactions primarily involve the burial of apolar surface from the solvent (hydrophobic effect) and electrostatic interactions.

        "abstract": "A single histidine residue has been placed at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of each of the two alpha-helices of barnase. The pKa of that histidine residue in each of the four mutants has been determined by 1H NMR. The pKas of the two residues at the C-terminus are, on average, 0.5 unit higher, and those of the residues at the N-terminus are 0.8 unit lower, than the pKa of histidines in unfolded barnase at low ionic strength. The conformational stability of the mutant proteins at different values of pH has been measured by urea denaturation. C-Terminal histidine mutants are approximately 0.6 kcal mol-1 more stable when the introduced histidine is protonated, both at low and high ionic strength. N-Terminal mutants with a protonated histidine residue are approximately 1.1 kcal mol-1 less stable at low ionic strength and 0.5 kcal mol-1 less stable at high ionic strength (1 M NaCl). The low-field 1H NMR spectra of the mutant proteins at low pH suggest that the C-terminal histidines form hydrogen bonds with the protein while the N-terminal histidines do not form the same. The perturbations of pKa and stability result from a combination of different electrostatic environments and hydrogen-bonding patterns at either ends of helices. The value of 0.6 kcal mol-1 represents a lower limit to the favorable electrostatic interaction between the alpha-helix dipole and a protonated histidine residue at the C-terminal end of the helix.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The unfolding and refolding kinetics of the VL(Oku) fragment were described by a single exponential term. Double-jump experiments, however, showed that two forms of the unfolding molecule exist.

Enzyme activity, circular dichroism, fluorescence, sedimentation, size exclusion chromatography, and viscosity measurements were used to monitor conformational transitions and characterize the native and denatured states. The observation of biphasic transitions for the unfolding of apothermolysin and the spectroscopic changes associated with each phase of the overall unfolding process suggest unfolding of the N-terminal domain at less than 1 M guanidine hydrochloride, followed by the unfolding of the C-terminal domain, with the transition midpoint at 3 M guanidine hydrochloride. The refolding of the C-terminal domain is reversible; however, refolding of the N-terminal domain could not be demonstrated owing to protein aggregation. A quantitative analysis of the two transitions suggest that the unfolding of the two structural domains of thermolysin is not completely independent. Attempts to measure the unfolding of holothermolysin were hampered by autolysis. However, it was possible to show that at least three calcium ions serve to stabilize thermolysin against autolysis or unfolding in guanidine hydrochloride. Similar stabilization was observed for thermolysin with a single terbium ion bound at calcium site S(1). This result is consistent with our earlier findings, which suggest that calcium bound at sites S(1)-S(2) are located at a critical point on the unfolding pathway of thermolysin and serve to act as an interdomain lock.",

To elucidate the mechanism of protein folding, the molten globule state has been studied as a model of the folding intermediate state. Lysozyme and alpha-lactalbumin are homologous to each other, but their equilibrium unfolding mechanisms differ. Generally, the folding mechanism of lysozyme obeys a two-state model, whereas that of alpha-lactalbumin follows a three-state model. Exceptions to this rule are equine and canine milk lysozymes, which exhibit a partially unfolded state during the equilibrium unfolding; this state resembles the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin but with extreme stability. Study of the molten globules of alpha-lactalbumin and equine milk lysozyme showed that the stabilities of their alpha-helices are similar, despite the differences in the thermodynamic stability of their molten globule states. On the other hand, our hydrogen exchange study of the molten globule of canine milk lysozyme showed that the alpha-helices are more stabilized than in alpha-lactalbumin or equine milk lysozyme and that this enhanced stability is caused by the strengthened cooperative interaction between secondary structure elements. Thus, our results underscore the importance of the cooperative interaction in the stability of the molten globule state.",

In this context, we have constructed a double mutant (Q58C/A99C) of the cold-active and heat-labile alpha-amylase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, defined on the basis of its strong similarity with the mesophilic enzyme from pig pancreas. This mutant was characterized to understand the role of an extra disulfide bond specific to warm-blooded animals and located near the entrance of the catalytic cleft. We show that the catalytic parameters of the mutant are drastically modified and similar to those of the mesophilic enzyme. Calorimetric studies demonstrated that the mutant is globally stabilized (DeltaDeltaG = 1.87 kcal/mol at 20 degrees C) when compared with the wild-type enzyme, although the melting point (T(m)) was not increased. Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments indicate a more compact structure for the mutated alpha-amylase. However, the strain imposed on the active site architecture induces a 2-fold higher thermal inactivation rate at 45 degrees C as well as the appearance of a less stable calorimetric domain. It is concluded that stabilization by the extra disulfide bond arises from an enthalpy-entropy compensation effect favoring the enthalpic contribution.",

        "abstract": "It is widely believed that beta-parvalbumin (PV) isoforms are intrinsically less stable than alpha-parvalbumins, due to greater electrostatic repulsion and an abbreviated C-terminal helix. However, when examined by differential scanning calorimetry, the apo-form of the rat beta-PV (i.e. oncomodulin) actually displays greater thermal stability than the alpha-PV. Whereas the melting temperature of the a isoform is 45.8 degrees C at physiological pH and ionic strength, the Tm for the beta isoform is more than 7 degrees higher (53.6 degrees C). This result suggests that factors besides net charge and C-terminal helix length strongly influence parvalbumin conformational stability. Extension of the F helix in the beta-PV, by insertion of Ser-109, has a modest stabilizing effect, raising the Tm, by 1.1 degrees. Truncation of the alpha-PV F helix, by removal of Glu-108, has a more profound impact, lowering the Tm by 4.0 degrees.",

        "abstract": "Studies on members of protein families with similar structures but divergent sequences provide insights into the effects of sequence composition on the mechanism of folding. Members of the peripheral subunit-binding domain (PSBD) family fold ultrafast and approach the smallest size for cooperatively folding proteins. Phi-Value analysis of the PSBDs E3BD and POB reveals folding via nucleation-condensation through structurally very similar, polarized transition states. Here, we present a Phi-value analysis of the family member BBL and found that it also folds by a nucleation-condensation mechanism. The mean Phi values of BBL, E3BD, and POB were near identical, indicating similar fractions of non-covalent interactions being formed in the transition state. Despite the overall conservation of folding mechanism in this protein family, however, the pattern of Phi values determined for BBL revealed a larger dispersion of the folding nucleus across the entire structure, and the transition state was less polarized. The observed plasticity of transition-state structure can be rationalized by the different helix-forming propensities of PSBD sequences. The very strong helix propensity in the first helix of BBL, relative to E3BD and POB, appears to recruit more structure formation in that helix in the transition state at the expense of weaker interactions in the second helix. Differences in sequence composition can modulate transition-state structure of even the smallest natural protein domains.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium and kinetic studies of the urea-induced unfolding of trp aporepressor from Escherichia coli were performed to probe the folding mechanism of this intertwined, dimeric protein. The equilibrium unfolding transitions at pH 7.6 and 25 degrees C monitored by difference absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy are coincident within experimental error. All three transitions are well described by a two-state model involving the native dimer and the unfolded monomer; the free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant and under standard-state conditions is estimated to be 23.3 +/- 0.9 kcal/mol of dimer. The midpoint of the equilibrium unfolding transition increases with increasing protein concentration in the manner expected from the law of mass action for the two-state model. We find no evidence for stable folding intermediates. Kinetic studies reveal that unfolding is governed by a single first-order reaction whose relaxation time decreases exponentially with increasing urea concentration and also decreases with increasing protein concentration in the transition zone. Refolding involves at least three phases that depend on both the protein concentration and the final urea concentration in a complex manner. The relaxation time of the slowest of these refolding phases is identical with that for the single phase in unfolding in the transition zone, consistent with the results expected for a reaction that is kinetically reversible. The two faster refolding phases are presumed to arise from slow isomerization reactions in the unfolded form and reflect parallel folding channels.",

The far-UV CD denaturation data yield average temperature-independent values of 0.99 +/- 0.10 kcal mol(-)(1) M(-)(1) for m and 0.98 +/- 0.05 kcal mol(-)(1) K(-)(1) for DeltaC(p)()(,U), the heat capacity change accompanying unfolding.

DeltaC(p)()(,U) and m determined for 434 Cro are in accord with values predicted using known empirical correlations with structure. The free energy of unfolding is pH-dependent, and the protein is completely unfolded at pH 2.0 and 25 degrees C as judged by calorimetry or CD. The stability of 434 Cro is lower than those observed for the structurally similar N-terminal domain of the repressor of phage 434 (R1-69) or of phage lambda (lambda(6)(-)(85)), but is close to the value reported for the putative monomeric lambda Cro. Since a protein's structural stability is important in determining its intracellular stability and turnover, the stability of Cro relative to the repressor could be a key component of the regulatory circuit controlling the levels and, consequently, the functions of the two proteins in vivo.",

This shows that the substantial reduction (25 degrees C at pH 3.8) in Tm resulting from removal of the 6-127 disulphide bond can, to a good approximation, be attributed totally to an increase in the entropy difference between the native and denatured states.

        "abstract": "In order to try to better understand the role played by strain in the structure and stability of a protein a series of \"small-to-large\" mutations was made within the core of T4 lysozyme. Three different alanine residues, one involved in backbone contacts, one in side-chain contacts, and the third adjacent to a small cavity, were each replaced with subsets of the larger residues, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe and Trp. As expected, the protein is progressively destabilized as the size of the introduced side-chain becomes larger. There does, however, seem to be a limit to the destabilization, suggesting that a protein of a given size may be capable of maintaining only a certain amount of strain. The changes in stability vary greatly from site to site. Substitution of larger residues for both Ala42 and Ala98 substantially destabilize the protein, even though the primary contacts in one case are predominantly with side-chain atoms and in the other with backbone. The results suggest that it is neither practical nor meaningful to try to separate the effects of introduced strain on side-chains from the effects on the backbone. Substitutions at Ala129 are much less destabilizing than at sites 42 or 98. This is most easily understood in terms of the pre-existing cavity, which provides partial space to accommodate the introduced side-chains. Crystal structures were obtained for a number of the mutants. These show that the changes in structure to accommodate the introduced side-chains usually consist of essentially rigid-body displacements of groups of linked atoms, achieved through relatively small changes in torsion angles. On rare occasions, a side-chain close to the site of substitution may change to a different rotamer. When such rotomer changes occur, they permit the structure to dissipate strain by a response that is plastic rather than elastic. In one case, a surface loop moves 1.2 A, not in direct response to a mutation, but in an interaction mediated via an intermolecular contact. It illustrates how the structure of a protein can be modified by crystal contacts.",

Combined with the analogous thermal unfolding data for the adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli, these three homologous proteins exhibit T(m) and DeltaS(T(m)) values consistent with differential entropy and enthalpy contributions of equal magnitude.

        "abstract": "The conformational stability of Shiga toxin B-subunit (STxB), a pentameric protein from Shigella dysenteriae has been characterized by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy under different solvent conditions. It is shown that the thermal folding/unfolding of STxB is a reversible process involving a highly cooperative transition between folded pentamer and unfolded monomers. The conformational stability of STxB is pH dependent and because of its pentameric nature is also concentration dependent. STxB is maximally stable in the pH range from 5 to 9 (Delta G upon unfolding is close to 13 kcal per mol of monomer at 25 degrees C), and its stability decreases both at lower and at higher pH values. The pH dependence of the Gibbs energy of stabilization between pH 2.5 and 5 is consistent with the change in the ionizable state of an average of four groups per monomer upon unfolding. Structural thermodynamic calculations show that the stabilization of the STxB pentamer is primarily due to the interactions established between monomers rather than intramonomer interactions. The folding of an isolated monomer into the conformation existing in the pentamer is unfavorable and expected to be characterized by a free-energy change upon folding in the order of 2.5 kcal mol(-1) at 25 degrees C. On the average, intersubunit interaction induced upon oligomerization of folded monomers should contribute close to -13.4 kcal per mol of monomer to bring the overall Gibbs energy to the experimentally determined value at this temperature.",

        "abstract": "Alpha-lactalbumin (alphaLA)-IIIA is a major kinetic intermediate present along the pathways of reductive unfolding and oxidative folding of bovine alpha-lactalbumin (alphaLA). It is a three-disulfide variant of native alphaLA lacking Cys(6)-Cys(120) at the alpha-helical domain. Stability and the unfolding/refolding mechanism of carboxymethylated alphaLA-IIIA have been investigated previously by stop-flow circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. A stable intermediate compatible with molten globule was shown to exist along the pathways of unfolding-refolding of alphaLA-IIIA [Ikeguchi et al. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 16695-12700; Horng et al. (2003) Proteins 52, 193-202]. We investigate here the unfolding-refolding pathways and conformational stability of alphaLA-IIIA using the method of disulfide scrambling with the following specific aims: (a) to isolate and characterize the observed stable molten globule, (b) to analyze the heterogeneity of folding-unfolding intermediates, (c) to elucidate the disulfide structure of extensively unfolded isomer of alphaLA-IIIA, and (d) to clarify the relative conformational stability between alphaLA-IIIA and alphaLA. Two scrambled isomers, designated as X-alphaLA-IIIA-c and X-alphaLA-IIIA-a (X stands for scrambled), were isolated under mild and strong denaturing conditions. Their disulfide structures, CD spectra, and manners of refolding to form the native alphaLA-IIIA were analyzed in this report. The results are consistent with the notion that X-alphaLA-IIIA-c and X-alphaLA-IIIA-a represent a partially unfolded and an extensively unfolded isomers of native alphaLA-IIIA, respectively. The unfolding-refolding pathways of alphaLA-IIIA are elaborated and compared with that of intact alphaLA. These results display new insight into one of the most extensively studied molecules in the field of protein folding and unfolding.",

Biochem. 269 (2002) 2124]. Comparison of the effects of urea on the enzyme with those of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and NaCl indicated that chloride ions significantly weakened the binding of shikimate. This finding prompted a more detailed examination of the effects of salts on the structure, function and stability of the enzyme; the effects of NaCl and Na(2)SO(4) were investigated in detail. These salts have very small effects on the secondary structure as judged by far UV CD circular dichroism (CD), although the near UV CD spectra suggest that some limited changes in the environment of aromatic amino acids may occur. Both salts inhibit SK activity and analysis of the kinetic and substrate binding parameters point to a complex mechanism for the inhibition. Inclusion of salts leads to a marked stabilisation against unfolding of the enzyme by urea. When the enzyme is unfolded by incubation in 4 M urea, addition of NaCl or Na(2)SO(4) leads to a relatively slow refolding of the enzyme as judged by the regain of native-like CD and fluorescence. In addition, the refolded enzyme can bind shikimate, though more weakly than the native enzyme. However, the refolded enzyme does not appear to be capable of binding nucleotides, nor does it possess detectable catalytic activity. The refolding process brought about by addition of salt in the presence of 4 M urea is not associated with any change in the fluorescence of the probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), indicating that an intermediate formed by hydrophobic collapse is unlikely to be significantly populated. The results point to both specific and general effects of salts on SK. These are discussed in the light of the structural information available on the enzyme.",

        "abstract": "A number of techniques, including circular dichroism, FTIR, front face fluorescence, and UV absorption spectrophotometries, dynamic light scattering, and DSC, were used to directly measure the colloidal and conformational stability of proteins in highly concentrated solutions. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA), chicken egg white lysozyme, human hemoglobin A0, and bovine fibrinogen as model proteins, the thermal transition temperatures of proteins in dilute and concentrated solutions were compared. At 10 degrees C, no significant differences in both secondary and tertiary structures were detected for proteins at different concentrations. When temperature was introduced as a variable, however, hemoglobin and fibrinogen demonstrated higher transition midpoints (T(m)s) in concentrated rather than in dilute solutions (deltaT(m) approximately 2-10 degrees C). In contrast, lysozyme and BSA in concentrated solutions exhibit a lower T(m) than in dilute solutions (deltaT(m) approximately 2-20 degrees C). From these studies, it appears that a variety of factors determine the effect of high concentrations on the colloidal and conformational stability of a particular protein. While the prediction of excluded volume theory is that high concentrations should conformationally stabilize proteins, other factors such as pH, kinetics, protein dynamics, and intermolecular charge-charge effects may affect the overall stability of proteins at high concentrations under certain conditions.",

        "abstract": "The molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin has ordered secondary structure in the alpha-domain, which comprises residues 1 to 34 and 86 to 123. In order to investigate which part of a polypeptide is important for stabilizing the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin, we have produced and studied three chimeric proteins of bovine and human alpha-lactalbumin. The stability of the molten globule state formed by domain-exchanged alpha-lactalbumin, in which the amino acid sequence in the alpha-domain comes from human alpha-lactalbumin and that in the beta-domain comes from bovine alpha-lactalbumin, is the same as that of human alpha-lactalbumin and is substantially greater than that of bovine alpha-lactalbumin. Therefore, our results show that the stability of the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin is determined by the alpha-domain and the beta-domain is not important for stabilizing the molten globule state. The substitution of residues 1 to 34 of bovine alpha-lactalbumin with those of human alpha-lactalbumin substantially increases the stability of the molten globule state, while the substitution of residues 86 to 123 of bovine alpha-lactalbumin with those of human alpha-lactalbumin decreases the stability of the molten globule state. Therefore, residues 1 to 34 in human alpha-lactalbumin is more important for the stability of the human alpha-lactalbumin molten globule state than residues 86 to 123. The stabilization of the molten globule state due to substitution of both residues 1 to 34 and 86 to 123 is not identical with the sum of the two individual substitutions, demonstrating the non-additivity of the stabilization of the molten globule state. This result indicates that there is a long-range interaction between residues 1 to 34 and 86 to 123 in the molten globule state of human alpha-lactalbumin. The differences in the stabilities of the molten globule states are well correlated with the averaged helical propensity values in the alpha-domain when the long-range interactions are negligible, suggesting that the local interaction is the dominant term for determining the stability of the molten globule state. Our results also indicate that the apparent cooperativity is closely linked to the stability of the molten globule state, even if the molten globule state is weakly cooperative.",

Two steps were followed to study the activation mechanism of CheY upon phosphorylation: first, we independently substituted the three aspartic acid residues in the active site with alanine; second, several mutations were designed in helix alpha 4, both to increase its level of stability and to improve its packing against the protein core. The structural and thermodynamic analysis of these mutant proteins provides further evidence of the connection between the active-site area and helix alpha 4, and helps to understand how small movements at the active site are transmitted and amplified to the protein surface.",

And the amino acid residue C117 of chloroplastic MDAR is the conserved cysteine residue in MDAR isoforms. A series mutation of conserved amino acid residue cysteine117 (C117) was constructed to investigate its role in MDAR structural stability and activity. Our study revealed that mutation in this conserved residue could cause pronounced loss of activity and conformational changes. Spectroscopic experiments indicated that these mutations influenced transition from the molten globule intermediate to the native state in folding process. These results suggested that amino acid residue C117 played a relatively important role in keeping MDAR structural stability and activity.",

        "abstract": "Seven hyper-stable multiple mutants have been constructed in staphylococcal nuclease by various combinations of eight different stabilizing single mutants. The stabilities of these multiple mutants determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation were 3.4 to 5.6 kcal/mol higher than that of the wild-type. Their thermal denaturation midpoint temperatures were 12.6 to 22.9 deg. C higher than that of the wild-type. These are among the greatest increases in protein stability and thermal denaturation midpoint temperature relative to the wild-type yet attained. There has been great interest in understanding how proteins found in thermophilic organisms are stabilized. One frequently cited theory is that the packing of hydrophobic side-chains is improved in the cores of proteins isolated from thermophiles when compared to proteins from mesophiles. The crystal structures of four single and five multiple stabilizing mutants of staphylococcal nuclease were solved to high resolution. No large overall structural change was found, with most changes localized around the sites of mutation. Rearrangements were observed in the packing of side-chains in the major hydrophobic core, although none of the mutations was in the core. It is surprising that detailed structural analysis showed that packing had improved, with the volume of the mutant protein's hydrophobic cores decreasing as protein stability increased. Further, the number of van der Waals interactions in the entire protein showed an experimentally significant increase correlated with increasing stability. These results indicate that optimization of packing follows as a natural consequence of increased protein thermostability and that good packing is not necessarily the proximate cause of high stability. Another popular theory is that thermostable proteins have more electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions and these are responsible for the high stabilities. The mutants here show that increased numbers of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions are not obligatory for large increases in protein stability.",

        "abstract": "The effects of pH and ligand binding on the stability of abrin II, a heterodimeric ribosome-inactivating protein, and its subunits have been studied using high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. At pH7.2, the calorimetric scan consists of two transitions, which correspond to the B-subunit [transition temperature (Tm) 319.2K] and the A-subunit (Tm 324.6K) of abrin II, as also confirmed by studies on the isolated A-subunit. The calorimetric enthalpy of the isolated A-subunit of abrin II is similar to that of the higher-temperature transition. However, its Tm is 2.4K lower than that of the higher-temperature peak of intact abrin II. This indicates that there is some interaction between the two subunits. Abrin II displays increased stability as the pH is decreased to 4.5. Lactose increases the Tm values as well as the enthalpies of both transitions. This effect is more pronounced at pH7.2 than at pH4.5. This suggests that ligand binding stabilizes the native conformation of abrin II. Analysis of the B-subunit transition temperature as a function of lactose concentration suggests that two lactose molecules bind to one molecule of abrin II at pH7.2. The presence of two binding sites for lactose on the abrin II molecule is also indicated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Plotting DeltaHm (the molar transition enthalpy at Tm) against Tm yielded values for DeltaCp (change in excess heat capacity) of 27+/-2 kJ.mol-1.K-1 for the B-subunit and 20+/-1 kJ.mol-1.K-1 for the A-subunit. These values have been used to calculate the thermal stability of abrin II and to surmise the mechanism of its transmembrane translocation.",

        "abstract": "Tropomyosin is a flexible 410 A coiled-coil protein in which the relative stabilities of specific regions may be important for its proper function in the control of muscle contraction. In addition, tropomyosin can be used as a simple model of natural occurrence to understand the inter- and intramolecular interactions that govern the stability of coiled-coils. We have produced eight recombinant tropomyosin fragments (Tm(143-284(5OHW),) Tm(189-284(5OHW)), Tm(189-284), Tm(220-284(5OHW)), Tm(220-284), Tm(143-235), Tm(167-260), and Tm(143-260)) and one synthetic peptide (Ac-Tm(215-235)) to investigate the relative conformational stability of different regions derived from the C-terminal region of the protein, which is known to interact with the troponin complex. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments show that the fragments that include the last 24 residues of the molecule (Tm(143-284(5OHW)), Tm(189-284(5OHW)), Tm(220-284(5OHW)), Tm(220-284)) are completely dimerized at 10 microm dimer (50 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 degrees C), whereas fragments that lack the native C terminus (Tm(143-235),Tm(167-260), and Tm(143-260)) are in a monomer-dimer equilibrium under these conditions. The presence of trifluoroethanol resulted in a reduction in the [theta](222)/[theta](208) circular dichroism ratio in all of the fragments and induced stable trimer formation only in those containing residues 261-284. Urea denaturation monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence revealed that residues 261-284 of tropomyosin are very important for the stability of the C-terminal half of the molecule as a whole. Furthermore, the absence of this region greatly increases the cooperativity of urea-induced unfolding. Temperature and urea denaturation experiments show that Tm(143-235) is less stable than other fragments of the same size. We have identified a number of factors that may contribute to this particular instability, including an interhelix repulsion between g and e' positions of the heptad repeat, a charged residue at the hydrophobic coiled-coil interface, and a greater fraction of beta-branched residues located at d positions.",

The unfolding equilibria of the VL and CL fragments were described in terms of the two-state transition. The midpoints of unfolding in the absence of ammonium sulfate were at 0.9 and 1.2 M guanidine hydrochloride for the CL and VL fragments respectively. The transition curves were shifted to higher concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride by 1.4 and 1.6 M for the CL and VL fragments, respectively, per mole of ammonium sulfate. Unfolding reactions of the VL and CL fragments in 3 M guanidine hydrochloride followed first-order kinetics, and the rate constants for the two proteins were both greatly decreased by the presence of ammonium sulfate. The refolding reaction of the CL fragment in 0.3 M guanidine hydrochloride consisted of two phases, and the rate constants were increased a little by the presence of ammonium sulfate. The refolding reaction of the VL fragment in 0.3 M guanidine hydrochloride followed first-order kinetics, and the rate was not affected by the presence of ammonium sulfate. These results showed that ammonium sulfate stabilizes the CL and VL fragments mainly by decreasing the unfolding rate.",

A double substitution (G185P, G186P) increases the protein stability without altering the secondary structure, suggesting that G185 and G186 are located in a loop/disordered region. A triple substitution (L222K, F225K, F229K) leads to a small increase in the alpha-helical content and stability, indicating that L222, F225, and F229 are not involved in stabilizing hydrophobic core contacts. The C-terminal truncation Delta(209-243) does not change the alpha-helical content but reduces the protein stability. Truncation of a larger segment, Delta(185-243), does not affect the secondary structure or stability. In contrast, an intermediate truncation, Delta(198-243), leads to a significant reduction in the alpha-helical content, stability, and unfolding cooperativity. The internal 11-mer deletion Delta(187-197) has no significant effect on the conformation or stability, whereas another internal 11-mer deletion, Delta(165-175), dramatically disrupts and destabilizes the protein conformation, suggesting that the presence of residues 165-175 is crucial for proper apoA-I folding. Overall, the findings suggest the presence of stable helical structure in the C-terminal region 165-243 of lipid-free apoA-I and the involvement of segment 209-243 in stabilizing interactions in the molecule. The effect of the substitution (G185P, G186P) on the exposure of tryptophans located in the N-terminal half suggests an apoA-I tertiary conformation with the C-terminus located close to the N-terminus.",

Here, we report the biochemical properties of a thermostable archaeal MAase from Thermoplasma volcanium GSS1 (TpMA) for the first time. The primary structure and catalytic properties of TpMA were similar to those of MAases, such as possession of an extra domain at its N-terminal and preference for CD over starch. TpMA showed high thermostability and optimal activity at 75 degrees C and 80 degrees C for beta-CD and soluble starch, respectively. The recombinant TpMA exists as a high oligomer in a solution and the oligomeric TpMA was dissociated into dimer and monomer mixture by a high concentration of NaCl. The substrate preference and thermostability of TpMA were significantly dependent on the oligomeric state of the enzyme. However, TpMA exhibited distinguishable characteristics from those of bacterial MAases. The transglycosylation pattern of TpMA was opposite to that of bacterial MAases. TpMA formed more alpha-1,4-glycosidic linked transfer product than alpha-1,6-linked products. Like as alpha-amylases, notably, TpMA has a longer subsite structure than those of other CD-degrading enzymes. Our findings in this study suggest that TpMA, the archaeal MAase, shares characteristics of both bacterial MAases and alpha-amylases, and locates in the middle of the evolutionary process between alpha-amylases and bacterial MAases.",

V., Venyaminov, S. Y., & Privalov, P. L. (1989) FEBS Lett. 244, 276-278]. The heat denaturation of PGK is characterized by the presence of a single peak in the excess heat capacity function obtained by differential scanning calorimetry. The transition curve approaches the two-state mechanism, indicating that the two domains of the molecule display strong cooperative interactions and that partially folded intermediates are not largely populated during the transition. On the contrary, the cold denaturation is characterized by the presence of two peaks in the heat capacity function. Analysis of the data indicates that at low temperatures the two domains behave independently of each other. The crystallographic structure of PGK has been used to identify the nature of the interactions between the two domains. These interactions involve primarily the apposition of two hydrophobic surfaces of approximately 480 A2 and nine hydrogen bonds. This information, in conjunction with experimental thermodynamic values for hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding interactions and statistical thermodynamic analysis, has been used to quantitatively account for the folding/unfolding behavior of PGK. It is shown that this type of analysis accurately predicts the cooperative behavior of the folding/unfolding transition and its dependence on GuHCl concentration.",

In our experimental system, stability toward thermal and denaturant unfolding was increased slightly as a result of the cross-link. The corresponding reduced protein was significantly less stable than the wild type. Unfolding and refolding kinetics were carried out in 35% methanol, pH 6.8 at -15 degrees C, with guanidine hydrochloride as the denaturant. Unfolding/refolding of the wild-type and reduced enzyme showed biphasic kinetics both within and outside the denaturant-induced transition region and were consistent with the presence of a populated intermediate in folding. Double-jump refolding experiments eliminated proline isomerization as a possible cause for the biphasicity.

Mutant Y75C was designed to test the importance of a large hydrophobic group to redox potential by replacing an aromatic group with a small nonpolar group. Both mutants exhibit spectral and redox properties indicating that their heme environments have been perturbed.

Different degrees of relative stability of the mutants toward a denaturant have been observed with the order being Y75C less than wt less than Y75F in the oxidized state and Y75C less than Y75F less than wt in the reduced state. These results are discussed in light of the recent structure determination of the R. capsulatus wild-type ferrocytochrome c2 to suggest that R. capsulatus tyrosine-75, or its equivalent in other species, is part of a conserved hydrogen-bonding network which plays an important role in maintaining high redox potentials and protein stability of cytochromes c in general.",

The destabilizing effect of GuHCl has revealed that the kinetics of the unfolding transition become extremely slow as the transition temperature decreases. At pH 5.3 and zero GuHCl, the unfolding transition is centered at 59.1 degrees C; upon increasing the GuHCl concentration, the transition occurs at lower temperatures and exhibits progressively slower kinetics; so, for example, at 3 M GuHCl, the transition temperature is 40.6 degrees C and is characterized by a time constant close to 10 min. Under all conditions studied (pH 5.3, pH 7.0, [GuHCl] < 3 M), the transition is thermodynamically reversible. The slow kinetics of the transition induce significant distortions in the shape of the transition profiles that can be mistakenly interpreted as deviations from a two-state mechanism. Determination of the thermodynamic parameters from the calorimetric data has required the development of an analytical formalism that explicitly includes the thermodynamics as well as the kinetics of the transition. Using this formalism, it is shown that a two-state slow-kinetics model is capable of accurately describing the structural stability of ribonuclease T1 as a function of temperature, GuHCl concentration, and scanning rate. Multidimensional analysis of the calorimetric data has been used to estimate the intrinsic thermodynamic parameters for protein stability, the interaction parameters with GuHCl, and the time constant for the unfolding transition and its temperature dependence.",

A mutational strategy that combines elimination of buried free cysteines and secondary mutations that enhance thermostability to achieve a substantial gain in functional half-life is described. Furthermore, the implementation of this design strategy utilizing stabilizing mutations within the core region resulted in a mutant protein that is essentially indistinguishable from wild type as regard protein surface and solvent structure, thus minimizing the immunogenic potential of the mutations.

(I) For all mutant and wild-type proteins, the Gibbs energy change (delta Gni(H2O)) in water between the native (N) and I states coincided with the difference (delta G++u(H2O)-delta G++r(H2O)) between the activation Gibbs energy changes in water for the unfolding (delta G++u(H2O) and refolding (delta G++r(H2O) reactions. This means that the early folding intermediate of the alpha subunit corresponds to the equilibrium intermediate. Delta Gni(H2O) values of all mutant proteins decreased compared with that of the wild-type protein. Gibbs energy change (delta Gid(H2O) in water between I and the denatured (D) states was not substantially affected by the substitutions. Delta G++u(H2O) and delta G++r(H2O) decreased and increased, respectively, for all mutant proteins. (2) Six conserved prolines played roles in stability and folding of the alpha subunit in a different manner: prolines 28 and 96 by stabilizing the N state and prolines 28, 96, 132, and 207 by destabilizing the I state. The contributions of prolines 57 and 62 to the stability were marginal. (3) Cis proline 28 was not the origin of the slow phase in the refolding kinetics assumed to arise from the cis-trans isomerization reaction of proline.",

        "abstract": "To test, at the level of individual amino acids, the conformation of an exchangeable apolipoprotein in aqueous solution and in the presence of an osmolyte trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), six synthetic peptide analogues of human apolipoprotein C-1 (apoC-1, 57 residues) containing point mutations in the predicted alpha-helical regions were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD). The CD spectra and the melting curves of the monomeric wild-type and plasma apoC-1 in neutral low-salt solutions superimpose, indicating 31 +/- 4% alpha-helical structure at 22 degrees C that melts reversibly with T(m,WT) = 50 +/- 2 degrees C and van't Hoff enthalpy deltaH(v,WT)(Tm) = 18 +/- 2 kcal/mol. G15A substitution leads to an increased alpha-helical content of 42 +/- 4% and an increased T(m,G15A) = 57 +/- 2 degrees C, which corresponds to stabilization by delta deltaG(app) = +0.4 +/- 1.5 kcal/mol. G15P mutant has approximately 20% alpha-helical content at 22 degrees C and unfolds with low cooperativity upon heating to 90 degrees C. R23P and T45P mutants are fully unfolded at 0-90 degrees C. In contrast, Q31P mutation leads to no destabilization or unfolding. Consequently, the R23 and T45 locations are essential for the stability of the cooperative alpha-helical unit in apoC-1 monomer, G15 is peripheral to it, and Q31 is located in a nonhelical linker region. Our results suggest that Pro mutagenesis coupled with CD provides a tool for assigning the secondary structure to protein groups, which should be useful for other self-associating proteins that are not amenable to NMR structural analysis in aqueous solution. TMAO induces a reversible cooperative coil-to-helix transition in apoC-1, with the maximal alpha-helical content reaching 74%. Comparison with the maximal alpha-helical content of 73% observed in lipid-bound apoC-1 suggests that the TMAO-stabilized secondary structure resembles the functional lipid-bound apolipoprotein conformation.",

        "abstract": "The folding pathways of four mutants in which bulky hydrophobic residues in the B helix of apomyoglobin (ApoMb) are replaced by alanine (I28A, L29A, I30A, and L32A) have been analyzed using equilibrium and kinetic methods employing NMR, CD, fluorescence and mass spectrometry. Hydrogen exchange pulse-labeling followed by mass spectrometry reveals detectable intermediates in the kinetic folding pathways of each of these mutants. Comparison of the quench-flow data analyzed by NMR for the wild-type protein and the mutants showed that the substitutions I28A, L29A and L32A lead to destabilization of the B helix in the burst phase kinetic intermediate, relative to wild-type apomyoglobin. In contrast, the I30A mutation apparently has a slight stabilizing effect on the B helix in the burst phase intermediate; under weak labeling conditions, residues in the C helix region were also relatively stabilized in the mutant compared to the wild-type protein. This suggests that native-like helix B/helix C packing interactions occur in the folding intermediate. The L32A mutant showed significantly lower proton occupancies in the burst phase for several residues in the G helix, specifically F106, I107, E109 and A110, which are in close proximity to L32 in the X-ray structure of myoglobin, providing direct evidence that native-like helix B/helix G contacts are formed in the apomyoglobin burst phase intermediate. The L29A mutation resulted in an increase in burst phase proton occupancies for several residues in the E helix. Since these regions of the B and E helices are not in contact in the native myoglobin structure, these effects suggest the possibility of non-native B/E packing interactions in the kinetic intermediate. The differing effects of these B helix mutations on the apomyoglobin folding process suggests that each side-chain plays a different and important role in forming stable structure in the burst phase intermediate, and points to a role for both native-like and non-native contacts in stabilization of the folding intermediate.",

        "abstract": "The structural and functional aspects along with equilibrium unfolding of procerain, a cysteine protease from Calotropis procera, were studied in solution. The energetic parameters and conformational stability of procerain in different states were also estimated and interpreted. Procerain belongs to the alpha + beta class of proteins. At pH 2.0, procerain exists in a partially unfolded state with characteristics of a molten globule-like state, and the protein is predominantly a beta-sheet conformation and exhibits strong ANS binding. GuHCl and temperature denaturation of procerain in the molten globule-like state is noncooperative, contrary to the cooperativity seen with the native protein, suggesting the presence of two parts in the molecular structure of procerain, possibly domains, with different stability that unfolds in steps. Moreover, tryptophan quenching studies suggested the exposure of aromatic residues to solvent in this state. At lower pH, procerain unfolds to the acid-unfolded state, and a further decrease in the pH drives the protein to the A state. The presence of 0.5 M salt in the solvent composition directs the transition to the A state while bypassing the acid-unfolded state. GuHCl-induced unfolding of procerain at pH 3.0 seen by various methods is cooperative, but the transitions are noncoincidental. Besides, a strong ANS binding to the protein is observed at low concentrations of GuHCl, indicating the presence of an intermediate in the unfolding pathway. On the other hand, even in the presence of urea (8 M), procerain retains all the activity as well as structural parameters at neutral pH. However, the protein is susceptible to unfolding by urea at lower pH, and the transitions are cooperative and coincidental. Further, the properties of the molten globule-like state and the intermediate state are different, but both states have the same conformational stability. This indicates that these intermediates may be located on parallel folding routes of procerain.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative interactions within ion-pair networks of hyperthermostable proteins are thought to be a major determinant for extreme protein stability. While the favorable thermodynamic contributions of optimized electrostatics in general as well as those of pairwise interactions have been documented, cooperativity between pairwise interactions has not yet been studied thermodynamically in proteins from hyperthermophiles. In this study we use the isolated cofactor binding domain of glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima to analyze pairwise and cooperative interactions within the salt-bridge triad Arg190-Glu231-Lys193. The X-ray structure of the domain was solved at 1.43 A and reveals the salt-bridge network with surrounding solvent molecules in detail. All three participating charges in the network were mutated to alanine in all combinations. The X-ray structure of the variant lacking all three charges reveals that the removal of the side chains has no effect on the overall conformation of the protein. Using solvent denaturation and thermodynamic cycles, the interaction energies between each pair of residues in the network were determined in the presence and in the absence of the third residue. Both the Arg190-Glu231 ion pair and the Lys193-Glu231 salt bridge in the absence of the third residue, contribute favorably to the free energy for unfolding of the domain in urea. Using guanidinium chloride as denaturant reveals a strong cooperativity between the two ion-pair interactions, the presence of the second ion pair converts the first interaction from destabilizing into stabilizing by as much as 1.09 kcal/mol. The different energetics of the salt-bridge triad in urea and GdmCl are discussed with reference to the observed anion binding in the crystal structure at high ionic strength and their possible role in a highly charged, high-temperature environment such as the cytoplasm of hyperthermophiles.",

        "abstract": "We have chosen two members of the microbial RNase family, barnase and binase, which have 85% identity (17 substitutions and 1 deletion) and almost identical three-dimensional structure, to study the evolution of protein stability. The 17 residues that differ are scattered throughout the molecule. Each of the 17 differing residues has been mutated independently and the effect on protein stability analysed. Each point mutation has an effect on protein stability that ranges from +1.1 to -1.1 kcal mol-1. These changes in energy are additive. There is no clear correlation between the type of mutation and the effect on protein stability. A multiple mutant having six of the single mutations that increase the stability of barnase is 3.3 kcal mol-1 more stable than wild type and has the same activity. There could be selective pressure to maintain proteins at a certain stability and, consequently, mutations that decrease stability tend to be counterbalanced by stabilizing mutations. Alternatively, there could simply be pressure to maintain stability above a certain level, and any further increases in stability need not be maintained during evolution. These results suggest a simple way to improve the stability of proteins: choose two homologous proteins that have high similarity, mutate individually all of the residues that differ between the two, and combine the mutations that increase the stability in a multiple mutant.",

This characterization has been possible by performing temperature scans at different guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) concentrations in order to experimentally define the temperature-GuHCl stability surface of the protein. Multidimensional analysis of the heat capacity surface has allowed simultaneous resolution of the energetics of the unfolded and molten globule states. These experiments indicate that the intrinsic enthalpy difference (i.e., excluding additional contributions such as those arising from differential GuHCl binding) between the unfolded and native states is 31.8 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C whereas that of the molten globule and native states is only 7.7 kcal/mol. At the same temperature, the entropy changes are 99.2 and 23.7 cal/K.mol and the heat capacity changes are 1821 and 326 cal/K.mol, respectively. Analysis of the thermodynamic data indicates that in passing from the native to the molten globule state only approximately 19% of the hydrogen bonds are broken. In addition, the magnitude of delta Cp for the molten globule suggests that water does not largely penetrate into the interior of the molten globule, implying that significant hydrophobic interactions are still present in this state. These parameters provide precise energetic constraints to the allowed structural conformations of the molten globule.",

        "abstract": "The effect of pH on the denatured state (3 M guanidine hydrochloride) was evaluated with fluorescence spectroscopy for four variants of iso-1-cytochrome c, AcTM (no surface histidines), AcH26 (surface histidine at position 26), AcH54 (surface histidine at position 54), and AcH54I52 (stabilizing I52 mutation added to AcH54). Changes in the compactness and the heme ligation of the denatured state, as a function of pH, were monitored through changes in Trp 59-heme fluorescence quenching. With the AcTM and AcH26 variants, no change in the fluorescence intensity occurs from pH 4 to 10. However, for the AcH54 and AcH54I52 variants the fluorescence intensity drops significantly between pH 4 and 6, consistent with His 54 binding to the heme of cytochrome c. Between pH 8 and 10 fluorescence intensity increases again, indicating that the His 54 is displaced from the heme. The data are consistent with lysines 4 and 5 being the primary heme ligands at alkaline pH, under denaturing conditions. This conclusion was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that heme-ligand affinity in the denatured state is controlled primarily by sequence position (loop size) and that when histidines are present they inhibit lysine ligation until approximately pH 8.5-9.0 as compared to pH 7.5 with the AcTM variant. Thus, at physiological pH, histidine ligands provide the primary constraint on the denatured state of cytochrome c. The heme-Trp 59 distance in the denatured state of iso-1-cytochrome c, derived from analysis by F\u00f6rster energy transfer theory, is approximately 26 A at pH 4 and 10, much shorter than the random coil prediction of 56 A. Surprisingly, the heme-Trp 59 distance in the His 54 bound conformation only drops to approximately 21 A, consistent with an extended conformation for the short polypeptide segment separating heme and Trp 59.",

Three phases of denaturation could be detected which we have assigned to part of the C-terminal domain, N-terminal domain and subunit dissociation coupled with further denaturation of the rest of the C-terminal domain at increasing urea concentrations. Acrylamide quenching suggests that at least one of the three tryptophan residues of the lambda repressor is in a different environment and its emission maximum is considerably blue-shifted. The transition in low urea concentration (midpoint approximately 2 M) affects the environment of this tryptophan residue, which is located in the C-terminal domain. Removal of the hinge and the N-terminal domain shifts this transition towards even lower urea concentrations, indicating the presence of interaction between hinge on N-terminal and C-terminal domains in the intact repressor.",

The structural properties of the purified proteins have been studied by CD spectroscopy, biological activity, recognition by conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The stabilities of the proteins have been measured by thermal and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. Proteins with disruptive core mutations are found to display a continuum of increasingly nonnative properties. Large internal volume changes cause both significant conformational rearrangements and destabilization by up to 5 kcal/mol. Variants with polar substitutions at core positions no longer behave like well-folded proteins but rather display characteristics of molten globules. However, even proteins bearing some of the most disruptive mutations retain many of the crude secondary and tertiary structural features of the wild-type protein.

Although Phi-value analysis has been widely used, these assumptions have not been tested to date because of the lack of high-resolution structures of intermediates and transition states. We recently have determined the structure of a folding intermediate for a four-helix bundle protein (Rd-apocytochrome b(562)) using NMR. The intermediate has the N-terminal helix unfolded. The other three helices fold in a native-like topology with extensive non-native hydrophobic interactions. Here, we have determined the Phi values for 14 hydrophobic core residues, including those with significant non-native interactions. All of the Phi values are in the normal range from 0 to 1, indicating that these non-native interactions cannot be identified by the common Phi-value analysis, and therefore, the first assumption is not valid for this intermediate. We also determined the structure of a mutant (F65A) of the intermediate and found that the structure of the intermediate is not perturbed by the mutation, supporting the second assumption. Together, these results suggest that Phi-value analysis may be valid for characterizing the energetics of the interactions between the mutated residue and others, but not for determining the detailed structures of intermediates and transition states because non-native interactions may exist and may not be identifiable by the common Phi-value analysis.",

Equilibrium denaturation by urea or temperature is fully reversible at pH 7.0 and fits to a two-state transition. The Gibbs energy of unfolding extrapolated to null concentration of chemical denaturant, delta GH2O, at pH 7.0 and 298 K, is calculated to be 17.0 +/- 1 kJ mol-1, which is within experimental error of the value determined by differential scanning calorimetry, 15.1 +/- 2 kJ mol-1. Kinetics of unfolding and refolding followed by fluorescence do not show the presence of any kinetic intermediate accumulating in the folding reaction. A value for delta GH2O of 17.9 +/- 0.7 kJ mol-1 can be extrapolated from the kinetic data. All these data indicate that the folding pathway of this domain is consistent with a two-state model (with the exception of the cis-Pro intermediates). More importantly, the analysis of this and several other small domains or proteins supports the hypothesis that stable kinetic folding intermediates are not necessary for a protein to fold. There seems to be a relationship between the size of a protein and the presence of stable kinetic intermediates. Globular proteins with less than 80 residues and no disulfide bonds follow a two-state transition, while proteins larger than 100 residues present stable kinetic folding intermediates.",

To link the stability parameters with structural information we use heat capacity group parameters and water accessible surface areas to calculate the change in heat capacity on unfolding of tendamistat. Our results show that both the group parameter and surface area approaches provide a reasonable, though not perfect, basis for delta Cp calculations. When using the experimentally determined temperature-independent heat capacity increase of 2.89 kJ mol-1 K-1 tendamistat exhibits convergence of thermodynamic parameters at about 140 degrees C, in agreement with recent predictions of the temperature at which the hydrophobic hydration is supposed to disappear. Despite the apparent support of this new view of the hydrophobic effect, there are inconsistencies in the interpretation of the thermodynamic parameters and these are addressed in the Discussion. The specific stability of tendamistat is similar to that of modified bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, with only two of the native three disulfide bridges intact. This observation confirms our previous conclusion that disulfide bridges affect significantly the enthalpy and entropy of unfolding. The recent study by Doig & Williams provides additional convincing support for this conclusion. The predictive scheme proposed by these authors permits a fair estimate of the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy changes of these two proteins.",

        "abstract": "We have used a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques to assess the thermodynamic and extrathermodynamic consequences of paired amino acid substitutions at positions 30 and 51 in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). Correctly folded, wild type BPTI contains a disulfide at the 30-51 positions, with the nonbackbone atoms of this cystine being relatively solvent inaccessible. Mutants missing this buried 30-51 disulfide adopt a conformation very similar to that of the native state of wild type BPTI (Eigenbrot et al., 1990, 1992), although they are severely destabilized relative to the wild type molecule (Hurle et al., 1990). We have conducted a systematic effort to find the energetically most favorable substitution for this buried 30-51 disulfide in BPTI. To this end, we have studied and characterized the thermally induced and guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation transitions for a family of mutants in which the amino acid residue(s) at positions 30 and/or 51 have been systematically altered. Specifically, we studied the unfolding transitions of the following series of residue 30/residue 51 paired substitution mutants: C30A/C51A, C30V/C51A, C30G/C51A, C30S/C51A, C30T/C51A, C30A/C51S, C30S/C51S, and C30G/C51M. For this series of mutants, comparisons between the relative stabilization free energies, derived from analysis of the denaturation profiles, allow us to reach the following conclusions: (a) side chains containing polar moieties (Ser and Thr) are destabilizing, with this effect being position dependent (i.e., a serine substitution is more destabilizing at position 51 than at position 30); (b) the destabilizing effects of two serine substitutions are approximately additive, suggesting that side chain-side chain hydrogen bonds between the two serine hydroxyl groups probably are weak or nonexistent; (c) the thermodynamic impact of a Gly30 substitution is consistent with a glycine-induced increase in the configurational entropy of the unfolded state; (d) the C30G/C51M mutant is highly destabilized relative to the C30A/C51A mutant despite the fact that, based on considerations of hydrophobicity and steric fit, substitution of a buried disulfide by Gly30 and Met51 would be expected to be optimal. Methionine may be particularly ill-suited as a buried disulfide substitute due to the large loss of side chain conformational entropy it undergoes during the transition from the unfolded to the native state. In the aggregate, our data provide insight into the residue-, position-, and context-dependent consequences on protein stability of \"designing out\" the buried 30-51 disulfide bond in the BPTI molecule. These data also suggest that a previously unrecognized component of disulfide bridge stabilization of proteins is the relatively minor penalty in side chain conformational entropy incurred by cystine residues during folding due to their severely restricted rotation even in the unfolded state.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium unfolding and the kinetic refolding of cytochrome c (Cyt c) in the presence of imidazole were studied with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The equilibrium unfolding experiments showed the radius of gyration, R(g), of native Cyt c to swell approximately 1 A with the addition of imidazole. The thermodynamic parameter m also reflects an expansion of the protein as its lower value demonstrates an increase in solvent-accessible surface area over that of native Cyt c in the absence of imidazole. Refolding was studied in the presence of imidazole as it prevents misligated intermediate states from forming during the refolding process, simplifying the kinetics, and making them easier to resolve. Time-resolved decreases in the forward scattering amplitude, I(0), demonstrated the transient formation of an aggregated intermediate. Final protein and denaturant concentrations were varied in the refolding kinetics, and the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was employed to characterize the associated state. This state was determined to be a dimer, with properties consistent with a molten globule.",

        "abstract": "A key paradigm in the biology of adaptation holds that urea affects protein function by increasing the fluctuations of the native state, while trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) affects function in the opposite direction by decreasing the normal fluctuations of the native ensemble. Using urea and TMAO separately and together, hydrogen exchange (HX) studies on RNase A at pH* 6.35 were used to investigate the basic tenets of the urea:TMAO paradigm. TMAO (1 M) alone decreases HX rate constants of a select number of sites exchanging from the native ensemble, and low urea alone increases the rate constants of some of the same sites. Addition of TMAO to urea solutions containing RNase A also suppresses HX rate constants. The data show that urea and TMAO independently or in combination affect the dynamics of the native ensemble in opposing ways. The results provide evidence in support of the counteraction aspect of the urea:TMAO paradigm linking structural dynamics with protein function in urea-rich organs and organisms. RNase A is so resistant to urea denaturation at pH* 6.35 that even in the presence of 4.8 M urea, the native ensemble accounts for >99.5% of the protein. An essential test, devised to determine the HX mechanism of exchangeable protons, shows that over the 0-4.8 M urea concentration range nearly 80% of all observed sites convert from EX2 to EX1. The slow exchange sites are all EX1; they do not exhibit global exchange even at urea concentrations (5.8 M) well into the denaturation transition zone, and their energetically distinct activated complexes leading to exchange gives evidence of residual structure. Under these experimental conditions, the use of DeltaG(HX) as a basis for HX analysis of RNase A urea denaturation is invalid.",

        "abstract": "The mutation Glu108-->Val (E108V) in T4 lysozyme was previously isolated as a second-site revertant that specifically compensated for the loss of function associated with the destabilizing substitution Leu99-->Gly (L99G). Surprisingly, the two sites are 11 A apart, with Leu99 in the core and Glu108 on the surface of the protein. In order to better understand this result we have carried out a detailed thermodynamic, enzymatic and structural analysis of these mutant lysozymes as well as a related variant with the substitution Leu99-->Ala. It was found that E108V does increase the stability of L99G, but it also increases the stability of both the wild-type protein and L99A by essentially equal amounts. The effects of E108V on enzymatic activity are more complicated. The mutation slightly reduces the maximal rate of cell wall hydrolysis of wild-type, L99G and L99A. At the same time, L99G is an unstable protein and rapidly loses activity during the course of the assay, especially at temperatures above 20 degrees C. Thus, even though the double mutant L99G/E108V has a slightly lower maximal rate than L99G, over a period of 20-30 minutes it hydrolyzes more substrate. This decrease in the rate of thermal inactivation appears to be the basis of the action of E108V as a second-site revertant of L99G. Mutant L99A creates a cavity of volume 149 A(3). Instead of enlarging this cavity, mutant L99G results in a 4-5 A displacement of part of helix F (residues 108-113), creating a solvent-accessible declivity. In the double mutant, L99G/E108V, this helix returns to a position akin to wild-type, resulting in a cavity of volume 203 A(3). Whether the mutation Glu108-->Val is incorporated into either wild-type lysozyme, or L99A or L99G, it results in a decrease in crystallographic thermal factors, especially in the helices that include residues 99 and 108. This increase in rigidity, which appears to be due to a combination of increased hydrophobic stabilization plus a restriction of conformational fluctuation, provides a structural basis for the increase in thermostability.",

Composed of only 68 residues, it must interact with at least two other proteins in the phage, and probably with DNA. To study the structural and functional properties of gpW, plasmids were constructed expressing gpW with hexahistidine tag sequences at either the N or C terminus. The purified wild type fusion proteins were found to be stably folded and biologically active. The protein is monomeric as judged by equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and appears to unfold by a cooperative two-state mechanism. Circular dichroism studies indicate that the protein is 47% helical, with a T(m) of 71.3 degrees C, and a DeltaG(u) of 3.01 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C. Mutagenesis of the three hydrophobic C-terminal residues of gpW showed that they are critical for activity, even though they do not contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the protein. Using secondary structure prediction as a guide, we also designed destabilized gpW mutants. The hydrophobic nature of the gpW C terminus caused these mutants to be degraded by the ClpP-containing proteases in Escherichia coli.",

        "abstract": "The role of the C-terminal region of Staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was examined by deletion mutation. Deletions up to eight residues do not affect the structure and function. The structure and enzymatic activity were partially lost by deleting Ser141-Asn149 (Delta141-149), and deletion of Trp140-Asn149 (Delta140-149) resulted in further loss of structure and activity. A 13-residue deletion showed the same effect as the 10-residue deletion. Both Ser141Gln and Ser141Ala mutations for an eight-residue deletion mutant did not alter properties as well as Ser141A1a for full-length SNase. In contrast, Trp140Ala mutation for Delta141-149 shows the same effect as the deletion of Trp140. Trp140Ala mutation for full-length SNase causes the loss of native structure. These observations indicate the significance of the 140th and the 141st residues. The side-chain of the 140th residue is required to be tryptophan; however, the backbone of the 141st residue is solely critical for foldability, but the side-chain information is not crucial. All of the mutants that take a non-native conformation show enzymatic activity and inhibitor-induced folding, suggesting that foldability is required for the activity.",

        "abstract": "We have used differential scanning calorimetry to measure the effect of replacements of valine 65 on thermal stability of the isolated kringle-2 domain of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The role of this site in stability was examined because a human t-PA variant having this valine (residue 245 in t-PA numbering) replaced with a methionine has been described [Johnston, M.D., & Berger, H. (1987) U.K. Patent Application GB 2176702A]. Mutants of kringle-2 having valine 65 replaced with Met, Leu, Ile, Thr, Ala, or Ser were constructed by using site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with a restricted site selection strategy. Isolated kringle-2 domains were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described for the wild-type domain [Cleary, S., Mulkerrin, M.G., & Kelley, R.F. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1884-1891]. None of these substitutions results in a significant perturbation of the native conformation of kringle-2 as judged by far-UV circular dichroism and equilibrium dialysis measurements of L-lysine affinity. A two-state analysis of the heat capacity profile observed for heating a solution of wild-type (w-t) kringle-2 containing 100 mM citrate, pH 4.5, provides values of 64.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C for Tg (melting temperature), 81 +/- 5 kcal/mol for delta H g, and 1.2 +/- 0.9 kcal/(mol-deg) for delta C p. Thermal denaturation of w-t kringle-2 is reversible in the pH range 3-6 as indicated by the observation of similar heat capacity profiles for consecutive heating cycles and also recovery of spectroscopic and lysine binding properties upon cooling the heat-denatured protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The contribution of hydrogen bonding by peptide groups to the conformational stability of globular proteins was studied. One of the conserved residues in the microbial ribonuclease (RNase) family is an asparagine at position 39 in RNase Sa, 44 in RNase T1, and 58 in RNase Ba (barnase). The amide group of this asparagine is buried and forms two similar intramolecular hydrogen bonds with a neighboring peptide group to anchor a loop on the surface of all three proteins. Thus, it is a good model for the hydrogen bonding of peptide groups. When the conserved asparagine is replaced with alanine, the decrease in the stability of the mutant proteins is 2.2 (Sa), 1.8 (T1), and 2.7 (Ba) kcal/mol. When the conserved asparagine is replaced by aspartate, the stability of the mutant proteins decreases by 1.5 and 1.8 kcal/mol for RNases Sa and T1, respectively, but increases by 0.5 kcal/mol for RNase Ba. When the conserved asparagine was replaced by serine, the stability of the mutant proteins was decreased by 2.3 and 1.7 kcal/mol for RNases Sa and T1, respectively. The structure of the Asn 39 --> Ser mutant of RNase Sa was determined at 1.7 A resolution. There is a significant conformational change near the site of the mutation: (1) the side chain of Ser 39 is oriented differently than that of Asn 39 and forms hydrogen bonds with two conserved water molecules; (2) the peptide bond of Ser 42 changes conformation in the mutant so that the side chain forms three new intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the backbone to replace three hydrogen bonds to water molecules present in the wild-type structure; and (3) the loss of the anchoring hydrogen bonds makes the surface loop more flexible in the mutant than it is in wild-type RNase Sa. The results show that burial and hydrogen bonding of the conserved asparagine make a large contribution to microbial RNase stability and emphasize the importance of structural information in interpreting stability studies of mutant proteins.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding of cellular prion protein and its refolding to the scrapie isoform are related to prion diseases. Studies in the literature have shown that structures of proteins, either acidic or basic, are stabilized against denaturation by certain neutral salts, for example, sulfate and fluoride. Contrary to these observations, the full-length recombinant prion protein (amino acid residues 23-231) is denatured by these protein structure stabilizing salts. Under identical concentrations of salts, the structure of the sheep prion protein, which contains a greater number of glycine groups in the N-terminal unstructured segment than the mouse protein, becomes more destabilized. In contrast to the full-length protein, the C-terminal 121-231 prion protein fragment, consisting of all the structural elements of the protein, viz., three alpha-helices and two short beta-strands, is stabilized against denaturation by these salts. We suggest that an increase in the concentration of the anions on the surface of the prion protein molecule due to their preferential interaction with the glycine residues in the N-terminal segment destabilizes the structure of the prion protein by perturbing the prion helix 1 which is the most soluble of all the protein alpha-helices reported so far in the literature.

In contrast, an extant CD study of beta beta and gamma gamma species of chicken gizzard tropomyosin concludes that their unfolding transitions are simple two-state transitions, with much smaller overall enthalpies (98 kcal mol(-1) for beta beta and 162 kcal mol(-1) for gamma gamma). However, these smaller enthalpies have been questioned, because they imply a concentration dependence of the melting temperatures that is far larger than observed by CD. We report here DSC studies of the unfolding of both beta beta and gamma gamma chicken gizzard homodimers. The results show that these transitions are very similar to those in rabbit tropomyosins in that 1) the overall unfolding enthalpy is near 300 kcal mol(-1); 2) the overall delta C(rho) values are significantly positive; 3) the various transitions are multistate, requiring at least two and as many as four domains to fit the DSC data. DSC studies are also reported on these homodimeric species of chicken gizzard tropomyosin with a single interchain disulfide cross-link. These results are also generally similar to those for the correspondingly cross-linked rabbit tropomyosins.",

As known from previous studies, the 3SS protein lacking a disulfide bond between Cys77 and Cys95 is destabilized by enthalpic factors, as revealed by a decrease of about 20 kJ/mol in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (DeltaG) value, as compared to the wild-type protein, which has four disulfide bonds. In this study, the stabilities and structures of the 3SS mutants were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray crystal analysis, respectively, and compared with those of the mutants (4SS mutants) from the wild-type (4SS) protein published previously. The stabilities of all the 3SS mutants, except for V110A-3SS were decreased as compared with that of the 3SS protein, coinciding with the results for the 4SS mutants. The change in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (DeltaDeltaG) values of the 3SS mutants relative to the 3SS protein at the denaturation temperature (49.2 degreesC) of the 3SS protein at pH 2.7 were similar to those of the equivalent 4SS mutants relative to the wild-type at 64.9 degreesC. The Delta DeltaG values of the 3SS mutants correlated with the changes in hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation (Delta DeltaASAHP) for all of the hydrophobic residues when the effects of the secondary structure propensity were considered. This correlation is identical with that previously found for the 4SS mutants. The linear relation between Delta DeltaG and Delta DeltaASAHP for all of the hydrophobic residues with the same slope was found also for the mutants of T4 lysozyme already reported, indicating that this is a general relationship between changes in conformational stability and changes in ASA values of hydrophobic residues due to mutations.",

Circular dichroism spectra and electron micrographs were identical for linked and non-linked species and indicated two-stranded coiled-coil structures with about 100% alpha-helicity at 20 degrees C. Thermal transition profiles revealed an increase of the melting temperature from 42 degrees C to 60.4 degrees C upon disulfide formation at a chain concentration of 25 microM. The enthalpy of interaction was identical for the two species but the negative entropy involved in joining the two chains was reduced by the disulfide bonds. At chain concentrations of 10 microM the Gibbs free energy delta G was by 17.5 kJ/mol more negative for the disulfide-linked than for the unlinked chains. Because of the concentration dependence of the entropy of the non-linked chains, this difference decreased with increasing concentration and, by extrapolation at chain concentrations of 10 mM, the stability of both structures would be the same. As a competing reaction, beta-chains associated to four-stranded bundles which probably consist of pairs of two-stranded coiled-coils. After disulfide formation a biphasic transition curve was observed which indicated two different ways of connecting the chains in the bundle.",

All of the multiple mutant IPMDHs were found to be improved in catalytic activity at moderate temperatures by increasing the k(cat) with a simultaneous increase of K(m) for the coenzyme NAD(+). k(cat) was improved by a decrease in the activation enthalpy, DeltaH( not equal). The multiple mutants did not show large reduction in thermal stability, and one of them showed enhanced thermal stability. Mutation from I11 to V was revealed to have a stabilizing effect. Mutants showed increased thermal stability when the mutation I11V was combined. This indicates that it is possible to construct mutants with enhanced thermal stability by combining stabilizing mutation. No additivity was observed for the thermodynamic properties of catalytic reaction in the multiple mutant IPMDHs, implying that the structural changes induced by the mutations were interacting with each other.

The enthalpy changes for the formation of the coiled-coil were delta H degrees = -304(+/- 30) kJ/mol for the beta gamma heterodimer and -198(+/- 20) kJ/mol for the beta-homoassociates. Gibbs free energies and entropies amounted to delta G degrees = -42.8 kJ and delta S degrees = -876 J/mol K for the heteroassembly and -37.8 kJ/mol and -537 J/mol K for the homoassembly of beta. This low preference for heteroassociation of the fragment is smaller than the chain selectivity observed for larger fragments and intact laminin. Deletion of ten residues from the C-terminal region of the gamma-fragment which were recently reported as an essential assembly-site was not sufficient to abolish heteroassociation. Interaction of alpha-fragment with double-stranded beta gamma coiled-coils reflected the formation of a three-stranded coiled-coil in laminin but for the small recombinant fragments association between alpha and beta-homoassociates was also observed. The C-terminal 100 residues in the coiled-coil domain are therefore not alone responsible for the high specificity of chain selection in laminin.",

        "abstract": "Spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus (S protein) plays a pivotal role in SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) infection. The immunological fragment of the S protein (Ala251-His641, SARS_S1b) is believed to be essential for SARS_CoV entering the host cell through S protein-ACE-2 interaction. We have quantitatively characterized the thermally induced and GuHCl-induced unfolding features of SARS_S1b using circular dichroism (CD), tryptophan fluorescence, and stopped-flow spectral techniques. For the thermally induced unfolding at pH 7.4, the apparent activation energy (E(app)) and transition midpoint temperature (Tm) were determined to be 16.3 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol and 52.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C, respectively. The CD spectra are not dependent on temperature, suggesting that the secondary structure of SARS_S1b has a relatively high thermal stability. GuHCl strongly affected SARS_S1b structure. Both the CD and fluorescent spectra resulted in consistent values of the transition middle concentration of the denaturant (Cm, ranging from 2.30 to 2.45 M) and the standard free energy change (deltaG(o), ranging from 2.1 to 2.5 kcal/mol) for the SARS_S1b unfolding reaction. Moreover, the kinetic features of the chemical unfolding and refolding of SARS_S1b were also characterized using a stopped-flow CD spectral technique. The obvious unfolding reaction rates and relaxation times were determined at various GuHCl concentrations, and the Cm value was obtained, which is very close to the data that resulted from CD and fluorescent spectral determinations. Secondary and three-dimensional structural predictions by homology modeling indicated that SARS_S1b folded as a globular-like structure by beta-sheets and loops; two of the four tryptophans are located on the protein surface, which is in agreement with the tryptophan fluorescence result. The three-dimensional model was also used to explain the recently published experimental results of S1-ACE-2 binding and immunizations.",

        "abstract": "The folding kinetics of a 16-residue beta-hairpin (trpzip4) and five mutants were studied by a laser-induced temperature-jump infrared method. Our results indicate that mutations which affect the strength of the hydrophobic cluster lead to a decrease in the thermal stability of the beta-hairpin, as a result of increased unfolding rates. For example, the W45Y mutant has a phi-value of approximately zero, implying a folding transition state in which the native contacts involving Trp45 are not yet formed. On the other hand, mutations in the turn or loop region mostly affect the folding rate. In particular, replacing Asp46 with Ala leads to a decrease in the folding rate by roughly 9 times. Accordingly, the phi-value for D46A is determined to be approximately 0.77, suggesting that this residue plays a key role in stabilizing the folding transition state. This is most likely due to the fact that the main chain and side chain of Asp46 form a characteristic hydrogen bond network with other residues in the turn region. Taken together, these results support the folding mechanism we proposed before, which suggests that the turn formation is the rate-limiting step in beta-hairpin folding and, consequently, a stronger turn-promoting sequence increases the stability of a beta-hairpin primarily by increasing its folding rate, whereas a stronger hydrophobic cluster increases the stability of a beta-hairpin primarily by decreasing its unfolding rate. In addition, we have examined the compactness of the thermally denatured and urea-denatured states of another 16-residue beta-hairpin, using the method of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Our results show that the thermally denatured state of this beta-hairpin is significantly more compact than the urea-denatured state, suggesting that the very first step in beta-hairpin folding, when initiated from an extended conformation, probably corresponds to a process of hydrophobic collapse.",

Stopped-flow tryptophan fluorescence for measuring the incorporation of aromatic residues into the protein core and far- and near-ultraviolet circular dichroism to measure the formation of secondary and tertiary structure, respectively, together with the formation of persistent structure measured by hydrogen exchange pulse labeling experiments analyzed by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry all show that 90% of the acyl-coenzyme A binding protein molecules achieve their fully folded and active, native state with a time constant of less than 5 ms at 25 degrees C and of ca. 30 ms at 5 degrees C. The kinetic parameters measured by the different techniques are closely similar, indicating that the different elements of structure form effectively concomitantly. There is no evidence for a significant population of any partially structured intermediate states, and the kinetics are identical whether refolding occurs from an unfolded state generated either by low pH or by addition of guanidine hydrochloride. The kinetics of both refolding and unfolding are monophasic processes for practically 90% of the molecules, and can be described by a two-state model. The results add to our knowledge of the folding scheme of different structural motifs and are discussed in terms of current views of the mechanisms of protein folding.",

        "abstract": "Cysteine residues can complicate the folding and storage of proteins due to improper formation of disulfide bonds or oxidation of residues that are natively reduced. Wild-type Rop is a homodimeric four-helix bundle protein and an important model for protein design in the understanding of protein stability, structure and folding kinetics. In the native state, Rop has two buried, reduced cysteine residues in its core, but these are prone to oxidation in destabilized variants, particularly upon extended storage. To circumvent this problem, we designed and characterized a Cys-free variant of Rop, including solving the 2.3 A X-ray crystal structure. We show that the C38A C52V variant has similar structure, stability and in vivo activity to wild-type Rop, but that it has dramatically faster unfolding kinetics like virtually every other mutant of Rop that has been characterized. This cysteine-free Rop has already proven useful for studies on solution topology and on the relationship of core mutations to stability. It also suggests a general strategy for removal of pairs of Cys residues in proteins, both to make them more experimentally tractable and to improve their storage properties for therapeutic or industrial purposes.",

        "abstract": "Electrostatic repulsion between positively charged groups has been suggested to be critical in determining the conformation of melittin. To clarify the role of repulsive forces, we prepared a series of succinylated melittins, an acetylated melittin, and a synthetic melittin mutant, with various degrees of charge repulsion. The conformation of the melittin derivatives was examined by far-UV circular dichroism under various conditions of pH and salt at 20 degrees C. The stability of the tetrameric helical state was found to be dependent on the net charge of the peptides. The charge repulsive forces destabilized the helical state of intact melittin by 600 cal/(charge.mol of tetramer). This value was close to the corresponding one (450 cal/(charge.mol)) obtained for the acidic molten globule of horse cytochrome c [Goto, Y., & Nishikiori, S. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222, 679-686], which has a molecular weight and a net charge comparable to those of the tetrameric melittin. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the tetrameric melittin and the molten globule of cytochrome c showed that the two states are also comparable to each other in the radius of gyration. These results suggest that the contribution of electrostatic repulsion to the conformational stability of melittin is similar to that of the molten globule.",

        "abstract": "The genes for two Sac7 DNA-binding proteins, Sac7d and Sac7e, from the extremely thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius have been cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. The sac7d and sac7e open reading frames encode 66 amino acid (7608 Da) and 65 amino acid (7469 Da) proteins, respectively. Southern blots indicate that these are the only two Sac7 protein genes in S. acidocaldarius, each present as a single copy. Sac7a, b, and c proteins appear to be carboxy-terminal modified Sac7d species. The transcription initiation and termination regions of the sac7d and sac7e genes have been identified along with the promoter elements. Potential ribosome binding sites have been identified downstream of the initiator codons. The sac7d gene has been expressed in E. coli, and various physical properties of the recombinant protein have been compared with those of native Sac7. The UV absorbance spectra and extinction coefficients, the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra, the circular dichroism, and the two-dimensional double-quantum filtered 1H NMR spectra of the native and recombinant species are essentially identical, indicating essentially identical local and global folds. The recombinant and native proteins bind and stabilize double-stranded DNA with a site size of 3.5 base pairs and an intrinsic binding constant of 2 x 10(7) M-1 for poly[dGdC].poly[dGdC] in 0.01 M KH2PO4 at pH 7.0. The availability of the recombinant protein permits a direct comparison of the thermal stabilities of the methylated and unmethylated forms of the protein. Differential scanning calorimetry demonstrates that the native protein is extremely thermostable and unfolds reversibly at pH 6.0 with a Tm of approximately 100 degrees C, while the recombinant protein unfolds at 92.7 degrees C.",

        "abstract": "Analysis of the genome of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus has revealed the presence of a previously undetected gene potentially encoding a plant- and mammalian-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. Expression of that gene in Escherichia coli has yielded a novel thermostable [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (designated ferredoxin 5) whose sequence is most similar to those of ferredoxins involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (Isc-Fd). It nevertheless differs from the latter proteins by having deletions near its N- and C-termini, and no cysteine residues other than those involved in [2Fe-2S] cluster coordination. Resonance Raman, low-temperature MCD and EPR studies show close spectral similarities between ferredoxin 5 and the Isc-Fd from Azotobacter vinelandii. M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the reduced protein were analyzed with an S = 1/2 spin Hamiltonian and interpreted in the framework of the ligand field model proposed by Bertrand and Gayda. The redox potential of A. aeolicus ferredoxin 5 (-390 mV) is in keeping with its relatedness to Isc-Fd. Unfolding experiments showed that A. aeolicus ferredoxin 5 is highly thermostable (T(m) = 106 degrees C at pH 7), despite being devoid of features (e.g., high content of charged residues) usually associated with extreme thermal stability. Searches for genes potentially encoding plant-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins have been performed on the sequenced genomes of hyperthermophilic organisms. None other than the two proteins from A. aeolicus were retrieved, indicating that this otherwise widely distributed group of proteins is barely represented among hyperthermophiles.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how an amino acid sequence folds into a functional, three-dimensional structure has proved to be a formidable challenge in biological research, especially for transmembrane proteins with multiple alpha helical domains. Mechanistic folding studies on helical membrane proteins have been limited to unusually stable, single domain proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin. Here, we extend such work to flexible, multidomain proteins and one of the most widespread membrane transporter families, the major facilitator superfamily, thus showing that more complex membrane proteins can be successfully refolded to recover native substrate binding. We determine the unfolding free energy of the two-domain, Escherichia coli galactose transporter, GalP; a bacterial homologue of human glucose transporters. GalP is reversibly unfolded by urea. Urea causes loss of substrate binding and a significant reduction in alpha helical content. Full recovery of helical structure and substrate binding occurs in dodecylmaltoside micelles, and the unfolding free energy can be determined. A linear dependence of this free energy on urea concentration allows the free energy of unfolding in the absence of urea to be determined as +2.5 kcal\u00b7mol(-1). Urea has often been found to be a poor denaturant for transmembrane helical structures. We attribute the denaturation of GalP helices by urea to the dynamic nature of the transporter structure allowing denaturant access via the substrate binding pocket, as well as to helical structure that extends beyond the membrane. This study gives insight into the final, critical folding step involving recovery of ligand binding for a multidomain membrane transporter.",

Spectroscopic probes indicate that the native and denatured state of the single-chain protein are similar to those of the unlinked Arc dimer. In equilibrium experiments, Arc-L1-Arc denatures in a reaction without populated intermediate states as judged by the fits of the denaturation isotherms to a two-state model and by the coincidence of denaturation curves monitored by fluorescence and circular dichroism. Comparison of the equilibrium stabilities of Arc-L1-Arc and unlinked Arc gives an effective concentration of subunits in the denatured single-chain variant of 2.7 (+/- 0.7) mM. The kinetic refolding and unfolding reactions of Arc-L1-Arc also appear to proceed without populated intermediates. The rate constant for Arc-L1-Arc unfolding is about 2-fold faster than that of unlinked Arc, indicating that the linker mediates no significant contacts in the native structure that need to be broken to allow unfolding. As expected, the major effect of the linker occurs during the refolding reaction, where the effective subunit concentration calculated from the bimolecular and unimolecular refolding rate constants is 4.5 (+/- 1.8) mM. The transition states for the unfolding and refolding reactions of Arc-L1-Arc and wild-type Arc have similar solvent exposures as measured by the urea dependencies of the equilibrium and rate constants.

Mutation of either Thr-58 or Glu-60 to alanine results in a decrease in stability of 0.7 +/- 0.1 kcal mol-1. These values reflect the loss of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of Thr-58 with Glu-60 and Arg-67 and hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge between Glu-60 and Arg-62 and Arg-65. In addition, these mutants were found to be much weaker inhibitors of the serine protease subtilisin BPN'.

Further, we find that these mutants are only temporary inhibitors of subtilisin BPN', unlike wild type.

The thermal denaturation of soluble myosin was complex and was characterized by a multistep endothermic process for the temperature range from 41 to 60 degrees C. The shape of the endotherm was highly dependent on the pH and the ionic strength of the solution, although the delta Hcal (calorimetric enthalpy) of denaturation (1715 +/- 75 kcal/mol) was insensitive to these changes for the solvent conditions used in this study. This value also agrees, within experimental error, with the sum of the denaturation enthalpies obtained for isolated fragments (1724 +/- 79 kcal/mol). In identical conditions of ionic strength, pH, and heating rate, the computer-calculated differential endotherms of domains belonging to S-1 and light chains were superimposable with those of the isolated fragments. Their responses to changes in the solvent condition were also similar. We suggest that the observed functional independence of the major domains in myosin reflects also the independence of their structural stability.

        "abstract": "The pyrrolidine ring of the amino acid proline reduces the conformational freedom of the protein backbone in its unfolded form and thus enhances protein stability. The strategy of inserting proline into regions of the protein where it does not perturb the structure has been utilized to stabilize many different proteins including enzymes. However, most of these efforts have been based on trial and error, rather than rational design. Here, we try to understand proline's effect on protein stability by introducing proline mutations into various regions of the B1 domain of Streptococcal protein G. We also applied the Optimization of Rotamers By Iterative Techniques computational protein design program, using two different solvation models, to determine the extent to which it could predict the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of prolines. Use of a surface area dependent solvation model resulted in a modest correlation between the experimental free energy of folding and computed energies; on the other hand, use of a Gaussian solvent exclusion model led to significant positive correlation. Including a backbone conformational entropy term to the computational energies increases the statistical significance of the correlation between the experimental stabilities and both solvation models.",

        "abstract": "We have used high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry to characterize the thermal stability of barnase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in the pH range 2.0-5.0. The energetics of the interaction between barnase and its inhibitor 3'GMP have been studied by isothermal titration calorimetry in the temperature range 15-30 degrees C. Scanning calorimetry experiments were also made with the protein in the presence of various concentrations of 3'GMP at pH 4.5. A novel, simple procedure is proposed to obtain binding parameters from scanning calorimetry data. This method is based on the calculation of the partition functions of the free and the ligand-bound protein. Isothermal calorimetry shows that at 25 degrees C 3'GMP binds to a single site in barnase with a delta Cp of -250 +/- 50 J/(K.mol). Both free barnase and ligand-bound barnase undergo a highly reversible, two-state thermal unfolding process under our experimental conditions. delta G and delta Cp unfolding values are similar to others found for globular proteins, whereas delta H and delta S unfolding values are unusually high at the denaturation temperature of barnase. We have also found unexpectedly that the thermodynamic unfolding parameters of barnase fit neither the trend of values described in the literature for the correlation between delta Cp and delta H nor the limiting specific enthalpy value in the correlation between delta H and Tm for globular proteins. These discrepancies might be related to particular features of the folded and/or unfolded states of the protein.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27(Kip1) is targeted for degradation by an SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex and that this process requires Cks1, a member of the highly conserved Suc1/Cks family of cell cycle regulatory proteins. All proteins of this family have Cdk-binding and anion-binding sites, but only mammalian Cks1 binds to Skp2 and promotes the association of Skp2 with p27 phosphorylated on Thr-187. The molecular mechanisms by which Cks1 promotes the interaction of the Skp2 ubiquitin ligase subunit to p27 remained obscure. Here we show that the Skp2-binding site of Cks1 is located on a region including the alpha2- and alpha1-helices and their immediate vicinity, well separated from the other two binding sites. All three binding sites of Cks1 are required for p27-ubiquitin ligation and for the association of Skp2 with Cdk-bound, Thr-187-phosphorylated p27. Cks1 and Skp2 mutually promote the binding of each other to a peptide similar to the 19 C-terminal amino acids of p27 containing phosphorylated Thr-187. This latter process requires the Skp2- and anion-binding sites of Cks1, but not its Cdk-binding site. It is proposed that the Skp2-Cks1 complex binds initially to the C-terminal region of phosphorylated p27 in a process promoted by the anion-binding site of Cks1. The interaction of Skp2 with the substrate is further strengthened by the association of the Cdk-binding site of Cks1 with Cdk2/cyclin E, to which phosphorylated p27 is bound.",

The reciprocal form of the Wyman-Tanford equation, which describes the unfolded-to-folded protein ratio as a function of water activity, was successfully applied to obtain a good linear relationship. From this analysis, the role of water activity on protein stability was clearly explained and the contributions of hydration and solute binding to protein molecule were separately discussed in protein unfolding.

        "abstract": "Structural and biochemical characterization of the nonliganding residue glutamine 143 near the manganese of human Mn superoxide dismutase (hMnSOD), a homotetramer of 22 kDa, reveals a functional role for this residue. In the wild-type protein, the side-chain amide group of Gln 143 is about 5 A from the metal and is hydrogen-bonded to Tyr 34, which is a second prominent side chain adjacent to the metal. We have prepared the site-specific mutant of hMnSOD with the conservative replacement of Gln 143 --> Asn (Q143N). The crystal structure of Q143N shows that the side-chain amide nitrogen of residue 143 is 1.7 A more distant from the manganese than in the wild-type enzyme. The Tyr 34 side-chain hydroxyl in Q143N is also moved to become 0.6 A more distant from the metal due to an additional water molecule. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that Q143N is slightly more stable than the wild-type enzyme with Tm for the main unfolding transition increased by 2 degrees C to 90.7 degrees C. Pulse radiolysis and stopped-flow spectrophotometry reveal that unlike wild-type hMnSOD, which is strongly inhibited by peroxide, Q143N MnSOD exhibits no product inhibition even at concentrations of O2. - in the millimolar range, and its catalysis follows Michaelis kinetics with no evidence of cooperativity. However, the overall catalytic activity of this mutant was decreased 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with the wild-type MnSOD, which can account for its lack of product inhibition. Q143N MnSOD lacked the visible absorption spectrum typical of wild-type Mn(III)SOD. Also, unlike the wild-type Mn(III)SOD, which is electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) silent, Q143N MnSOD has a complex EPR spectrum with many resonances in the region below 2250 G. We conclude that the Gln 143 --> Asn mutation has increased the reduction potential of manganese to stabilize Mn(II), indicating that Gln 143 has a substantial role in maintaining a reduction potential favorable for the oxidation and reduction cycles in the catalytic disproportionation of superoxide. A solvent hydrogen isotope effect near 2 for kcat in catalysis by Q143N hMnSOD indicates rate-contributing proton transfers to form product hydroperoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide. The data demonstrate a prominent role for Gln 143 in maintaining the microenvironment of the manganese and in efficient catalysis of superoxide dismutation to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.",

Determination of the extremities of the polypeptide chains forming individual fragments allowed the scheme of proteolysis and the borders between domains in the D region of fibrinogen to be established. It was also found that the most thermostable region of the D fragment (TSD) can be substantially reduced in size without loss of its compact structure. The alpha-helical content of the newly prepared 21-kDa TSD2 and 16-kDa TSD3 fragments were 82% and 75%, respectively, strongly supporting a coiled-coil structure for this region of the fibrinogen molecule. The DX and DZ fragments, prepared from a chymotryptic digest of the DLA fragment, were found to be similar to the DL and DY fragments, respectively, except for an internal cleavage at K393-T394 in their beta chains. This cleavage leads to destabilization of all thermolabile domains, indicating interaction between them. The DL and DY fragments, containing only one polymerization site in their beta chains, were able to inhibit fibrin polymerization at high concentration. However, these same fragments failed to bind to fibrin-Sepharose under conditions where their structural analogues, DX and DZ, were tightly bound, indicating that cleavage after K393 substantially increases the affinity of this site.",

        "abstract": "The role of water in protein folding, specifically its presence or not in the transition-state structure, is an unsolved question. There are two common classes of folding-transition states: diffuse transition states, in which almost all side chains have similar, rather low phi (phi) values, and polarized transition states, which instead display distinct substructures with very high phi-values. Apo-and zinc-forms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin both fold in two-state equilibrium and kinetic reactions; while the apo-form exhibits a polarized transition state, the zinc form entails a diffuse, moving transition state. To examine the presence of water in these two types of folding-transition states, we probed the equilibrium and kinetic consequences of replacing core valines with isosteric threonines at six positions in azurin. In contrast to regular hydrophobic-to-alanine phi-value analysis, valine-to-threonine mutations do not disrupt the core packing but stabilize the unfolded state and can be used to assess the degree of solvation in the folding-transition state upon combination with regular phi-values. We find that the transition state for folding of apo-azurin appears completely dry, while that for zinc-azurin involves partially formed interactions that engage water molecules. This distinct difference between the apo-and holo-folding nuclei can be rationalized in terms of the shape of the free-energy barrier.",

        "abstract": "Tyrosine 34 is a prominent and conserved residue in the active site of the manganese superoxide dismutases in organisms from bacteria to man. We have prepared the mutant containing the replacement Tyr 34 --> Phe (Y34F) in human manganese superoxide dismutase (hMnSOD) and crystallized it in two different crystal forms, orthorhombic and hexagonal. Crystal structures of hMnSOD Y34F have been solved to 1.9 A resolution in a hexagonal crystal form, denoted as Y34Fhex, and to 2.2 A resolution in an orthorhombic crystal form, denoted as Y34Fortho. Both crystal forms give structures that are closely superimposable with that of wild-type hMnSOD, with the phenyl rings of Tyr 34 in the wild type and Phe 34 in the mutant very similar in orientation. Therefore, in Y34F, a hydrogen-bonded relay that links the metal-bound hydroxyl to ordered solvent (Mn-OH to Gln 143 to Tyr 34 to H2O to His 30) is broken. Surprisingly, the loss of the Tyr 34 hydrogen bonds resulted in large increases in stability (measured by Tm), suggesting that the Tyr 34 hydroxyl does not play a role in stabilizing active-site architecture. The functional role of the side chain hydroxyl of Tyr 34 can be evaluated by comparison of the Y34F mutant with the wild-type hMnSOD. Both wild-type and Y34F had kcat/Km near 10(9) M-1 s-1, close to diffusion-controlled; however, Y34F showed kcat for maximal catalysis smaller by 10-fold than the wild type. In addition, the mutant Y34F was more susceptible to product inhibition by peroxide than the wild-type enzyme. This activity profile and the breaking of the hydrogen-bonding chain at the active site caused by the replacement Tyr 34 --> Phe suggest that Tyr 34 is a proton donor for O2* - reduction to H2O2 or is involved indirectly by orienting solvent or other residues for proton transfer. Up to 100 mM buffers in solution failed to enhance catalysis by either Y34F or the wild-type hMnSOD, suggesting that protonation from solution cannot enhance the release of the inhibiting bound peroxide ion, likely reflecting the enclosure of the active site by conserved residues as shown by the X-ray structures. The increased thermostability of the mutant Y34F and equal diffusion-controlled activity of Y34F and wild-type enzymes with normal superoxide levels suggest that evolutionary conservation of active-site residues in metalloenzymes reflects constraints from extreme rather than average cellular conditions. This new hypothesis that extreme rather than normal substrate concentrations are a powerful constraint on residue conservation may apply most strongly to enzyme defenses where the ability to meet extreme conditions directly affects cell survival.",

As an initial step to elucidate the stabilization mechanism of the thermophilic RNase H, we examined whether certain regions in its amino acid sequence confer the thermostability. A variety of mutant proteins of E. coli RNase HI were constructed and analyzed for protein stability. In these mutant proteins, amino acid sequences in loops or terminal regions were systematically replaced with the corresponding sequences from T. thermophilus RNase H. Of the nine regions examined, replacement of the amino acid sequence in each of four regions (R4-R7) resulted in an increase in protein stability. Simultaneous replacements of these amino acid sequences revealed that the effect of each replacement on protein stability is independent of each other and cumulative. Replacement of all four regions (R4-R7) gave the most stable mutant protein. The temperature of the midpoint of the transition in the thermal unfolding curve and the free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant of this mutant protein were increased by 16.7 degrees C and 3.66 kcal/mol, respectively, as compared to those of E. coli RNase HI.

        "abstract": "Delta-crystallin, the major soluble protein component in the avian eye lens, is homologous to argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Two delta-crystallin isoforms exist in ducks, delta1- and delta2-crystallin, which are 94% identical in amino acid sequence. While duck delta2-crystallin (ddeltac2) has maintained ASL activity, evolution has rendered duck delta1-crystallin (ddeltac1) enzymatically inactive. Previous attempts to regenerate ASL activity in ddeltac1 by mutating the residues in the 20s (residues 22-31) and 70s (residues 74-89) loops to those found in ddeltac2 resulted in a double loop mutant (DLM) which was enzymatically inactive (Tsai, M. et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 11672-82). This result suggested that one or more of the remaining five amino acid substitutions in domain 1 of the DLM contributes to the loss of ASL activity in ddeltac1. In the current study, residues Met-9, Val-14, Ala-41, Ile-43, and Glu-115 were targeted for mutagenesis, either alone or in combination, to the residues found in ddeltac2. ASL activity was recovered in the DLM by changing Met-9 to Trp, and this activity is further potentiated in the DLM-M9W mutant when Glu-115 is changed to Asp. The roles of Trp-9 and Asp-115 were further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis in wild-type ddeltac2. Changing the identity of either Trp-9 or Asp-115 in ddeltac2 resulted in a dramatic drop in enzymatic activity. The loss of activity in Trp-9 mutants indicates a preference for an aromatic residue at this position. Truncation mutants of ddeltac2 in which the first 8, 9, or 14 N-terminal residues were removed displayed either decreased or no ASL activity, suggesting residues 1-14 are crucial for enzymatic activity in ddeltac2. Our kinetic studies combined with available structural data suggest that the N-terminal arm in ASL/delta2-crystallin is involved in stabilizing regions of the protein involved in substrate binding and catalysis, and in completely sequestering the substrate from the solvent.",

        "abstract": "Thermodynamic investigations of flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium and its proteolytic fragments were conducted by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) melting measurements. A new method of analysis for a multi-state transition based on our original theoretical treatment of thermodynamic equations has been developed to analyze those data. The analysis of DSC curves confirmed the three thermodynamic domains of flagellin. The thermodynamic parameters of each domain were revised from those previously reported and the new values of the parameters have a good correlation to the apparent molecular masses of the morphological domains. CD melting measurements at far and near-UV wavelengths showed sequential unfolding of the domains. Therefore, we could reasonably assign the thermodynamically identified domains to the morphological domains. Further analysis of both DSC and CD data provided insights into the folding energetics of the multidomain structure of flagellin. An inner domain (Df1) of flagellin in the filament unfolds through a relatively broad transition, while the two outer domains unfold cooperatively and show sharp transitions. This indicates that the interdomain interactions between Df1 and D2 has different characteristics from the apparently more intimate interactions between D2 and D3. These characteristics suggest that flagellin is organized with relatively flexible domains and rigid domains, which appears to be responsible for the well-regulated assembly mechanism of the bacterial flagellar filament.",

The findings suggest that D102/D103 and E110/E111 located in helix 4 and segment(s) between residues 61 and 78 are involved in maintenance of the conformation and stability of apoA-I in both the lipid-free state and in rHDL. R116/K118 located in helix 4 are essential for the conformation and stabilization of apoA-I in rHDL but not vital for the lipid-free state of the protein. The R160V/H162A substitutions in helix 6 lead to a less compact tertiary structure of lipid-free apoA-I without notable effects on the lipid-free or lipid-bound secondary conformation, suggesting involvement of R160/H162 in important interhelical interactions. The results on the Delta(121-142) mutant, together with our earlier findings, suggest disordered structure of a major segment between residues 121 and 143, likely including residues 131-143, in lipid-free apoA-I. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence for stabilization of rHDL by specific electrostatic interhelical interactions, in agreement with the double belt model. The effects of alterations in the conformation and stability of the apoA-I mutants on in vitro and in vivo functions of apoA-I and lipid homeostasis are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Small disulfide-rich proteins provide examples of simple and stable scaffolds for design purposes. The cystine-stabilized beta-sheet (CSB) motif is one such elementary structural motif and is found in many protein families with no evolutionary relationships. In this paper, we present NMR structural studies and stability measurements of two short peptides of 21 and 23 residues that correspond to the isolated CSB motif taken from a 28-residue squash trypsin inhibitor. The two peptides contain two disulfide bridges instead of three for the parent protein, but were shown to fold in a native-like fashion, indicating that the CSB motif can be considered an autonomous folding unit. The 23-residue peptide was truncated at the N-terminus. It has a well-defined conformation close to that of the parent squash inhibitor, and although less stable than the native protein, it still exhibits a high T(m) of about 100 degrees C. We suggest that this peptide is a very good starting building block for engineering new bioactive molecules by grafting different active or recognition sites onto it. The 21-residue peptide was further shortened by removing two residues in the loop connecting the second and third cysteines. This peptide exhibited a less well-defined conformation and is less stable by about 1 kcal mol(-)(1), but it might be useful if a higher flexibility is desired. The lower stability of the 21-residue peptide is supposed to result from inadequate lengths of segments connecting the first three cysteines, thus providing new insights into the structural determinants of the CSB motif.",

The entropic cost of making a surface salt bridge involving the protein's backbone is reduced, since the backbone has already been immobilized upon protein folding.",

        "abstract": "Both the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free forms of alpha-lactalbumin can assume essentially the same folded conformation as evidenced by similarity in their CD and proton n.m.r. spectra. Thermal unfolding followed by the aromatic CD has shown that the stability of the folded state is markedly enhanced by Ca2+ and that the stabilization is almost entirely entropic; addition of 0.1 mM Ca2+ shifts the transition temperature from 40 degrees to 62 degrees in 0.1M Na+ at pH 7.0. The enthalpy change of the unfolding, coincident between the two forms, is, however, significantly smaller than that known for lysozyme. The n.m.r. spectrum under the condition that both the forms of the protein are in the folded state reflects minor environmental changes of certain protons upon Ca2+ binding, and these changes are shown to afford useful probes for assessment of the location of the binding site. From the pH dependence and temperature dependence of the spectrum and also by using spin decoupling in the aromatic region (6.4-8.7 p.p.m.), it is shown that none of histidyl residues are affected and that at least two tryptophanyl ring protons experience environmental changes upon Ca2+ binding to the folded apo-protein. Effect of free excess Ca2+ on the spectrum has also shown that in native alpha-lactalbumin there is only one Ca2+-binding site that is detectable by the present method.",

        "abstract": "The pH-induced conformational transition in the CuA domain of subunit II of cytochrome oxidase of Paracoccus denitrificans (PdII) has been investigated using various spectroscopic and stopped-flow kinetic methods. UV-visible absorption and circular dichroism studies showed that an increase in pH from 6 to 10 leads to a conformation change with pK(a) = 8.2 associated with the CuA site of the protein. The secondary structure of the protein was, however, shown to remain unchanged in these two conformational states. Thermal and urea-induced unfolding studies showed that the \"low-pH\" conformation is more stable compared to the \"high-pH\" conformation of the protein. Moreover, the overall stability of the protein was found to decrease on reduction of the metal centers in the low-pH form, while the oxidation state of the metal centers did not have any significant effect on the overall stability of the protein in the high-pH form. Stopped-flow pH-jump kinetic studies suggested that the conformational transition is associated with a slow deprotonation step followed by fast conformational equilibrium. The results are discussed in the light of understanding the pH-induced conformational change in the beta-barrel structure of the protein and its effect on the coordination geometry of the metal site.",

The free energy changes of lysozymes for the unfolding in aqueous solution at pH 5.5 and 35 degrees C were 10.0, 10.1, 11.0 and 7.7 kcal/mol for wild type, Asp101Pro102, Gly101Pro102 and Pro101Gly102 lysozyme respectively. When the energy level in the unfolded state of wild type lysozyme was fixed at a standard level, the energy levels in the folded state of Asp101Pro102 and Pro101Gly102 lysozymes were found to be higher than that of wild type lysozyme on the basis of delta GD(H2O) and entropy losses of their polypeptide chains in the unfolded state. The presence of some strain in the folded state of these lysozymes was supported by both the calculation of conformational energy for a trans-L-prolyl residue [Schimmel, P.R. and Flory, P.J.

The dependences of calorimetric denaturation enthalpy on denaturation temperature both in water and 20% ethanol are linear and intersect at about 95 degrees C. In 20% ethanol the pH shift from 5.9 to 8.0 results in a decreased number of cooperative domains in pepsinogen. This process causes no changes either in the secondary structure or in the local surroundings of aromatic amino acids.

        "abstract": "The effects of four single amino acid replacements on the stability and folding of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase from Escherichia coli have been investigated by ultraviolet differences spectroscopy. In previous studies [Miles, E. W., Yutani, K., & Ogasahara, K. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 2586], it had been shown that the urea-induced unfolding at pH 7.8, 25 degrees C, proceeds by the initial unfolding of the less stable carboxyl domain (residues 189-268) followed by the unfolding of the more stable amino domain (residues 1-188). The effects of the Phe-22----Leu, Glu-49----Met, Gly-234----Asp, and Gly-234----Lys mutants on the equilibrium unfolding process can all be understood in terms of the domain unfolding model. With the exception of the Glu-49----Met replacement, the effects on stability are small. In contrast, the effects of three of the four mutations on the kinetics of interconversion of the native form and one of the stable partially folded intermediates are dramatic. The results for the Phe-22----Leu and Gly-234----Asp mutations indicate that these residues play a key role in the rate-limiting step. The Glu-49----Met mutation increases the stability of the native form with respect to that of the intermediate but does not affect the rate-limiting step. The Gly-234----Lys mutation does not affect either the stability or the kinetics of folding for the transition between native and intermediate forms. The changes in stability calculated from the unfolding and refolding rate constants agree quantitatively with those obtained from the equilibrium data. When considered with the results from a previous study on the Gly-211----Glu replacement [Matthews, C. R., Crisanti, M. M., Manz, J. T., & Gepner G. L.

The endothermic transitions for these two proteins were always irreversible under all conditions investigated. The denaturation behaviour of both proteins seems to fit very well with the kinetic model for the DSC study of irreversible unfolding of proteins recently proposed by one of our groups. From this model, the activation energies obtained for the denaturation of the pro- and carboxypeptidase were 300 +/- 20 kJ mol-1 and 250 +/- 14 kJ mol-1 respectively. On the other hand, the isolated activation segment appears as a thermostable piece with a highly reversible thermal unfolding which follows a two-state process. The denaturation temperature observed for the isolated segment was always at least 15 K higher than those of the zymogen and the active enzyme.",

The mutated residues in PA c-551, selected with reference to the corresponding residues in HT c-552, were located in three spatially separated regions: region I, Phe7 to Ala/Val13 to Met; region II, Glu34 to Tyr/Phe43 to Tyr; and region III, Val78 to Ile. The thermodynamic parameters determined indicated that the mutations in regions I and III caused enhanced stability through not only enthalpic but also entropic contributions, which reflected improved packing of the side chains. Meanwhile, the mutated region II made enthalpic contributions to the stability through electrostatic interactions. The obtained differences in the Gibbs free energy changes of unfolding [Delta(DeltaG)] showed that the three regions contributed to the overall stability in an additive manner. HT c-552 had the smallest heat capacity change (DeltaC(P)), resulting in higher DeltaG values over a wide temperature range (0-100 degrees C), compared to the PA c-551 variants; this contributed to the highest stability of HT c-552.

To understand the molecular mechanism, residue 126 was substituted with one of eight other residues, Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Glu, Leu, Ile or Phe. Circular dichroism analyses revealed a decreased thermal stability of the mutants (Delta T ((1/2))= 0-13 degrees C), indicating structural perturbations caused by steric conflict with surrounding residues having larger side chains. Kinetic parameters, k(cat) and K(m) values for isopropylmalate and NAD, were also affected by the mutation, but the resulting k(cat)/K(m) values were similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the change in the catalytic property is caused by the change in free-energy level of the Michaelis complex state relative to that of the initial state. The kinetic parameters and activation enthalpy change (Delta H (double dagger)) showed good correlation with the van der Waals volume of residue 126. These results suggested that the artificial cold adaptation (enhancement of k(cat) value at low temperatures) resulted from the destabilization of the ternary complex caused by the increase in the volume of the residue at position 126.",

        "abstract": "A moderately stable protein with typical folding kinetics unfolds and refolds many times during its cellular lifetime. In monomeric lambda repressor this process is extremely rapid, with an average folded state lifetime of only 30 milliseconds. A thermostable variant of this protein (G46A/G48A) unfolds with the wild-type rate, but it folds in approximately 20 microseconds making it the fastest-folding protein yet observed. The effects of alanine to glycine substitutions on the folding and unfolding rate constants of the G46A/G48A variant, measured by dynamic NMR spectroscopy, indicate that the transition state is an ensemble comprised of a disperse range of conformations. This structural diversity in the transition state is consistent with the idea that folding chains are directed towards the native state by a smooth funnel-like conformational energy landscape. The kinetic data for the folding of monomeric lambda repressor can be understood by merging the new energy landscape view of folding with traditional models. This hybrid model incorporates the conformational diversity of denatured and transition state ensembles, a transition state activation energy, and the importance of intrinsic helical stabilities.",

        "abstract": "A continuous-flow mixing device with a dead time of 100 micros coupled with intrinsic tryptophan and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence was used to monitor structure formation during early stages of the folding of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase). A variant with a unique tryptophan fluorophore in the N-terminal beta-barrel domain (Trp76 SNase) was obtained by replacing the single Trp140 in wild-type SNase with His in combination with Trp substitution of Phe76. A common background of P47G, P117G and H124L mutations was chosen in order to stabilize the protein and prevent accumulation of cis proline isomers under native conditions. In contrast to WT(*) SNase, which shows no changes in tryptophan fluorescence prior to the rate-limiting folding step ( approximately 100 ms), the F76W/W140H variant shows additional changes (enhancement) during an early folding phase with a time constant of 75 micros. Both proteins exhibit a major increase in ANS fluorescence and identical rates for this early folding event. These findings are consistent with the rapid accumulation of an ensemble of states containing a loosely packed hydrophobic core involving primarily the beta-barrel domain while the specific interactions in the alpha-helical domain involving Trp140 are formed only during the final stages of folding. The fact that both variants exhibit the same number of kinetic phases with very similar rates confirms that the folding mechanism is not perturbed by the F76W/W140H mutations. However, the Trp at position 76 reports on the rapid formation of a hydrophobic cluster in the N-terminal beta-sheet region while the wild-type Trp140 is silent during this early stage of folding. Quantitative modeling of the (un)folding kinetics and thermodynamics of these two proteins versus urea concentration revealed that the F76W/W140H mutation selectively destabilizes the native state relative to WT(*) SNase while the stability of transient intermediates remains unchanged, leading to accumulation of intermediates under equilibrium conditions at moderate denaturant concentrations.",

The CO2 hydrase activity and affinity for sulfonamide inhibitors of P202A CAII are virtually identical to those of wild type. However, the substitution of cis-alanine for cis-proline decreases the stability of the folded state by approximately 5 kcal mol-1 relative to both the unfolded state and an equilibrium intermediate in guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation. This destabilization can be attributed mainly to the less favorable cis/trans equilibrium of Xaa-alanine bonds compared to Xaa-proline bonds in the denatured state although other factors, including increased conformational entropy of the denatured state and decreased packing interactions in the native state, also contribute to the observed destabilization. The high catalytic activity of P202A CAII illustrates that unfavorable local conformations are nonetheless endured to satisfy the precise structural requirements of catalysis and ligand binding in the CAII active site.",

We have applied theories of irreversible thermodynamics to obtain the activation energy. In the presence of liposomes of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine with the ganglioside, GD(1a), the denaturation temperature of the hemagglutinin protein is lowered. This lowering of thermal stability is also reflected in the temperature dependence of the circular dichroism spectra. Quasi-elastic light scattering confirms that liposomes containing GD(1a) interact with the virus and inhibit the growth in the size of the particle as a function of temperature. Although the virus can fuse with the liposomes at higher temperatures, the enthalpy change for this process is not detectable.

Metal analysis reveals that NikR can bind a variety of divalent transition metals, including Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Co(II), and Cd(II). The selectivity of metal binding to NikR was investigated by using electronic absorption spectroscopy and small-molecule competitors. The relative affinities, Mn(II) < Co(II) < Ni(II) < Cu(II) > or = Zn(II), follow the Irving-Williams series of metal-complex stabilities. Similar metal affinities were measured for the isolated metal-binding domain of NikR. To determine if any of these metal ions confer a differential effect on NikR, the stability of the metal-bound complexes was examined. In both thermal and chemical denaturation experiments, nickel binding stabilizes the protein more than any of the other metals tested. Thermal denaturation experiments indicate that metal dissociation occurs after loss of secondary structure, but there was no evidence for metal binding to unfolded protein following reversible chemical denaturation. These experiments demonstrate that, although several different metals can bind to NikR, nickel exerts a selective allosteric effect. The implications of these experiments on the in vivo role of NikR as a nickel metalloregulator are discussed.",

This collection of 104 mutant proteins was analyzed by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) denaturation, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to quantitate the equilibrium between native and denatured states. From the analysis of these data, each mutant protein's stability in the absence of denaturant (delta GH2O) and sensitivity to changes in denaturant concentration [mGuHCl = d(delta G)/d[GuHCl]] were obtained. Several general trends in these values suggest that electrostatic interactions make only a minor contribution to the net stability of this protein. For the residue pairs that form ten salt bridges and ten charged hydrogen bonds between side chains, no correlation was observed between the stability losses (delta delta G) accompanying alanine substitution of each member of the pair. Little or no significant correlation was found between the magnitude of the loss in stability and the local electrostatic potential calculated from the three-dimensional structure by numerical and model dependent solutions of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The structural parameters which correlated most strongly with stability loss are measures of the extent of burial of the residue in the native structure, as was previously observed for alanine and glycine substitutions of large hydrophobic residues [Shortle et al. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8033] and of the polar, uncharged residues [Green et al. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 5717].

        "title": "Local and long-range interactions in the thermal unfolding transition of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A.", 
        "abstract": "This research was undertaken to distinguish between local and global unfolding in the reversible thermal denaturation of bovine pancreatic ribonclease A (RNase A). Local unfolding was monitored by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence of nine mutants in each of which a single tryptophan was substituted for a wild-type residue. Global unfolding was monitored by far-UV circular dichroism and UV absorbance. All the mutants (except F8W and D38W) exhibited high specific enzymatic activity, and their far-UV CD spectra were very close to that of wild-type RNase A, indicating that the tryptophan substitutions did not affect the structure of any of the mutants (excluding K1W and Y92W) under folding conditions at 20 degrees C. Like wild-type RNase A, the various mutants exhibited reversible cooperative thermal unfolding transitions at pH 5, with transition temperatures 2.5-11 degrees C lower than that of the wild-type transition, as detected by far-UV CD or UV absorbance. Even at 80 degrees C, well above the cooperative transition of all the RNase A mutants, a considerable amount of secondary and tertiary structure was maintained. These studies suggest the following two-stage mechanism for the thermal unfolding transition of RNase A as the temperature is increased. First, at temperatures lower than those of the main cooperative transition, long-range interactions within the major hydrophobic core are weakened, e.g., those involving residues Phe-8 (in the N-terminal helix) and Lys-104 and Tyr-115 (in the C-terminal beta-hairpin motif). The structure of the chain-reversal loop (residues 91-95) relaxes in the same temperature range. Second, the subsequent higher-temperature cooperative unfolding transition is associated with a loss of secondary structure and additional changes in the tertiary contacts of the major hydrophobic core, e.g., those involving residues Tyr-73, Tyr-76, and Asp-38 on the other side of the molecule. The hydrophobic interactions of the C-terminal loop of the protein are enhanced by high temperature, and perhaps are responsible for the preservation of the local structural environment of Trp-124 at temperatures slightly above the major cooperative transition. The results shed new light on the thermal unfolding transitions, generally supporting the thermal unfolding hypothesis of Burgess and Scheraga, as modified by Matheson and Scheraga.",

        "abstract": "Many small, single-domain proteins show equilibrium and kinetic folding mechanisms that appear to be adequately described as two state. The two-state model makes several predictions that can be tested experimentally. First, the conformational stability determined at or extrapolated to a set of reference conditions should be independent of the measurement method (thermal or solvent denaturation or hydrogen exchange). Second, model-independent measures of the cardinal thermodynamic parameters (T(m), DeltaH) as determined from direct calorimetric means should be identical to those determined from the two-state analysis of thermal unfolding data. Third, the ratio of the kinetic folding and unfolding rate constants should be equal to K(eq) determined from an equilibrium measurement under the same conditions. Here, we show that the wild-type HPr protein from Bacillus subtilis does not meet all of these criteria under our standard conditions. However, if we replace the side chain of Asp69, or add moderate concentrations of salt, we find excellent two-state behavior in both equilibrium and kinetic folding. Thus, for this protein and possibly others, very subtle changes in the primary structure or in the solution conditions can dramatically alter the relative stabilities of the native intermediate, and unfolded ensembles can cause an observable change in the nature of the folding mechanism.",

Gp57A is an oligomeric alpha-helix protein with 79 amino acids. Analysis of the sedimentation velocity data by direct boundary modeling with Lamm equation solutions together with a more detailed boundary analysis incorporating association schemes led us to conclude that at least three oligomeric species of gp57A are in reversible and fast association equilibria and that a 3(mer)-6(mer)-12(mer) model described the data best. On the other hand, differential scanning microcalorimetry revealed a highly reversible two-step transition of dissociation/denaturation, both of which accompanied decrease in CD at 222 nm. The melting curve analysis revealed that it is consistent with a 6(mer)-3(mer)-1(mer) model. The refolding/association kinetics of gp57A measured by stopped-flow CD was consistent with the interpretation that the bimolecular reaction from trimer to hexamer was preceded by a fast alpha-helix formation in the dead-time. Trimer or hexamer is likely the functional oligomeric state of gp57A.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics of the slow folding and unfolding reactions of barstar, a bacterial ribonuclease inhibitor protein, have been studied at 23(+/-1) degrees C, pH 8, by the use of tryptophan fluorescence, far-UV circular dichroism (CD), near-UV CD, and transient mixing (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic measurements in the 0-4 M range of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) concentration. The denaturant dependences of the rates of folding and unfolding processes, and of the initial and final values of optical signals associated with these kinetic processes, have been determined for each of the four probes of measurement. Values determined for rates as well as amplitudes are shown to be very much probe dependent. Significant differences in the intensities and rates of appearance and disappearance of several resolved resonances in the real-time one-dimensional NMR spectra have been noted. The NMR spectra also show increasing dispersion of chemical shifts during the slow phase of refolding. The denaturant dependences of rates display characteristic folding chevrons with distinct rollovers under strongly native as well as strongly unfolding conditions. Analyses of the data and comparison of the results obtained with different probes of measurement appear to indicate the accumulation of a myriad of intermediates on parallel folding and unfolding pathways, and suggest the existence of an ensemble of transition states. The energetic stabilities of the intermediates estimated from kinetic data suggest that they are approximately half as stable as the fully folded protein. The slowness of the folding and unfolding processes (tau = 10-333 s) and values of 20.5 (+/-1.4) and 18 (+/-0.5) kcal mol(-)(1) for the activation energies of the slow refolding and unfolding reactions suggest that proline isomerization is involved in these reactions, and that the intermediates accumulate and are therefore detectable because the slow proline isomerization reaction serves as a kinetic trap during folding.",

        "abstract": "Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been a well-established model system for protein folding. The enzyme DHFR from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (TmDHFR) displays distinct adaptations toward high temperatures at the level of both structure and stability. The enzyme represents an extremely stable dimer; no isolated structured monomers could be detected in equilibrium or during unfolding. The equilibrium unfolding strictly follows the two-state model for a dimer (N(2) right harpoon over left harpoon 2U), with a free energy of stabilization of DeltaG = -142 +/- 10 kJ/mol at 15 degrees C. The two-state model is applicable over the whole temperature range (5-70 degrees C), yielding a DeltaG vs T profile with maximum stability at around 35 degrees C. There is no flattening of the stability profile. Instead, the enhanced thermostability is characterized by shifts toward higher overall stability and higher temperature of maximum stability. TmDHFR unfolds in a highly cooperative manner via a nativelike transition state without intermediates. The unfolding reaction is much slower (ca. 10(8) times) compared to DHFR from Escherichia coli (EcDHFR). In contrast to EcDHFR, no evidence for heterogeneity of the native state is detectable. Refolding proceeds via at least two intermediates and a burst-phase of rather low amplitude. Reassociation of monomeric intermediates is not rate-limiting on the folding pathway due to the high association constant of the dimer.",

        "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin is a blue-copper protein with a Greek-key fold. Removal of copper produces an apoprotein with the same structure as holoazurin. To address the effects on thermodynamic stability and folding dynamics caused by small cavities in a beta-barrel, we have studied the behavior of the apo-forms of wild-type and two mutant (His-46-Gly and His-117-Gly) azurins. The equilibrium- and kinetic-folding and unfolding reactions appear as two-state processes for all three proteins. The thermodynamic stability of the two mutants is significantly decreased as compared with the stability of wild-type azurin, in accord with cavities in or near the hydrophobic interior having an overall destabilizing effect. Large differences are also found in the unfolding rates: the mutants unfold much faster than wild-type azurin. In contrast, the folding-rate constants are almost identical for the three proteins and closely match the rate-constant predicted from the native-state topology of azurin. We conclude that the topology is more important than equilibrium stability in determining the folding speed of azurin.",

Here the contribution of the helix propensity and hydrophobicity of residues at partially buried positions of alpha-helix to the stability of a model protein-ubiquitin- is explored. Thermodynamic stabilities of 13 ubiquitin variants with substitutions at a partially buried helical residue were measured by differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the dynamic range of stabilities for different amino acid residues at this partially buried position is 3 times larger than that expected based on helical propensity alone. Correlation analysis shows that both helical propensity and hydrophobicity are important in defining the relative stabilities of the studied ubiquitin variants. These results provide experimental evidence that partially buried positions are potentially useful sites for engineering proteins with enhanced thermostability.",

(1985) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 37, 32-41]. Nucleotide sequencing of the entire protein-encoding portion of the cloned ATIII-Utah gene revealed a C to T transitional mutation which converts proline-407 to leucine. Proline-407 is located 14 amino acids C-terminal to the reactive site arginine of ATIII in a core region of the molecule that has been highly conserved during evolution of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene family. The location of this proline in the crystal structure of the homologous serpin alpha 1-antitrypsin suggests that the leucine substitution in ATIII-Utah may interfere with correct folding of the mutant gene product, leading to its rapid turnover and the low antithrombin levels observed in patient plasmas. The Pro-407 to Leu mutation does not interfere with binding of antithrombin III to heparin. Patient antithrombin III, isolated by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, was reacted with purified thrombin. ATIII encoded by the patient's normal gene formed protease-inhibitor complexes with thrombin, whereas the product of the ATIII-Utah gene did not. The Pro-407 to Leu mutation destroys a restriction site for the enzyme StuI, permitting rapid diagnosis of affected members of the Utah kindred by Southern blotting of genomic DNA.",

The dodecameric structure of Mn.GS was retained throughout heating cycles, and thermal transitions were reversible as shown by rescans [with 6-18 mg of GS (Mr 622,000) from 15 to 68 degrees C at 20-60 degrees C/h] and by greater than 93% recovery of activity. A cooperative ratio delta Hcal/delta HvH of 1.6 +/- 0.1 and deconvolution analysis show two cooperative units (two-state transitions): t1 = 50.4 and t2 = 51.7 degrees C; the ratio of the relative sizes of thermally labile domains is approximately 1:2 as judged by delta H2/delta H1 approximately equal to 2. However, the thermally induced overall enthalpy change (0.34 cal/g) for GS dodecamer is only 5-10% of that for thermal unfolding of small globular proteins at 50 degrees C. The t1 and t2 values from deconvolutions of DSC data agree with t0.5 values previously calculated from spectral measurements of temperature-induced exposures of approximately 0.7 of 2 Trp and approximately 2 of 17 Tyr per subunit, respectively [Shrake et al.

        "abstract": "The thermal stability of human insulin was studied by differential scanning microcalorimetry and near-UV circular dichroism as a function of zinc/protein ratio, to elucidate the dissociation and unfolding processes of insulin in different association states. Zinc-free insulin, which is primarily dimeric at room temperature, unfolded at approximately 70 degrees C. The two monomeric insulin mutants Asp(B28) and Asp(B9),Glu(B27) unfolded at higher temperatures, but with enthalpies of unfolding that were approximately 30% smaller. Small amounts of zinc caused a biphasic thermal denaturation pattern of insulin. The biphasic denaturation is caused by a redistribution of zinc ions during the heating process and results in two distinct transitions with T(m)'s of approximately 70 and approximately 87 degrees C corresponding to monomer/dimer and hexamer, respectively. At high zinc concentrations (>or=5 Zn(2+) ions/hexamer), only the hexamer transition is observed. The results of this study show that the thermal stability of insulin is closely linked to the association state and that the zinc hexamer remains stable at much higher temperatures than the monomer. This is in contrast to studies with chemical denaturants where it has been shown that monomer unfolding takes place at much higher denaturant concentrations than the dissociation of higher oligomers [Ahmad, A., et al.

        "abstract": "Engineering proteins to withstand a broad range of conditions continues to be a coveted objective, holding the potential to advance biomedicine, industry, and our understanding of disease. One way of achieving this goal lies in elucidating the underlying interactions that define protein stability. It has been shown that the hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonding, and packing interactions between residues in the protein interior are dominant factors that define protein stability. The role of surface residues in protein stability has received much less attention. It has been believed that surface residues are not important for protein stability particularly because their interactions with the solvent should be similar in the native and unfolded states. In the case of surface charged residues, it was sometimes argued that solvent exposure meant that the high dielectric of the solvent will further decrease the strength of the charge-charge interactions. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the surface charged residues are not important for protein stability. We computationally redesigned sequences of five different proteins to optimize the surface charge-charge interactions. All redesigned proteins exhibited a significant increase in stability relative to their parent proteins, as experimentally determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. These results suggest that surface charge-charge interactions are important for protein stability and that rational optimization of charge-charge interactions on the protein surface can be a viable strategy for enhancing protein stability.",

        "abstract": "The human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) envelope glycoprotein consists of a trimer of two noncovalently and weakly associated subunits, gp120 and gp41. Upon binding of gp120 to cellular receptors, this labile native envelope complex undergoes conformational changes, resulting in a stable trimer-of-hairpins structure in gp41. Formation of the hairpin structure is thought to mediate membrane fusion by placing the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity. An in vitro-derived variant of SIVmac251, denoted CPmac, has acquired an unusually stable virion-associated gp120-gp41 complex. This unique phenotype is conferred by five amino acid substitutions in the gp41 ectodomain. Here we characterize the structural and physicochemical properties of the N40(L6)C38 model of the CPmac gp41 core. The 1.7-A resolution crystal structure of N40(L6)C38 is very similar to the six-helix bundle structure present in the parent SIVmac251 gp41. In both structures, three N40 peptides form a central three-stranded coiled coil, and three C38 peptides pack in an antiparallel orientation into hydrophobic grooves on the coiled-coil surface. Thermal unfolding studies show that the CPmac mutations destabilize the SIVmac251 six-helix bundle by 15 kJ/mol. Our results suggest that the formation of the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins structure is thermodynamically coupled to the conformational stability of the native envelope glycoprotein and raise the intriguing possibility that introduction of mutations to destabilize the six-helix bundle may lead to the stabilization of the trimeric gp120-gp41 complex.

        "abstract": "The structure of Escherichia coli-derived rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) exhibits a beta-clam topology comprised of two five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets surrounding a large solvent-filled cavity into which the ligand binds. It also contains two alpha-helices that span residues E15-A32 and join beta-strands A and B. This helical domain is conserved in all proteins of this family for which structures have been determined. In order to assess the structural and functional role of the helical domain, we engineered a variant of I-FABP by deleting residues 15-31 and inserting a Ser-Gly linker after residue 14. Circular dichroism measurements indicated that this I-FABP variant, termed delta 17-SG, has a high beta-sheet content similar to that of the wild-type protein. Two-dimensional NMR spectra of delta 17-SG revealed patterns similar to those observed for wild-type I-FABP, except for the selective absence of resonances and through-space interactions assigned to the helical domain. The delta 17-SG variant was less stable to denaturant than wild-type I-FABP, but the folding-unfolding transition was highly cooperative and reversible. Taking into account the lower stability, the refolding kinetics of delta 17-SG were essentially identical to those of wild-type. We conclude that delta 17-SG is a helix-less, essentially all-beta-sheet variant of I-FABP and that the helical domain is not a required element of the beta-clam topology of I-FABP. In addition, the helical domain does not appear to serve as a nucleation site for the refolding process. As shown in the accompanying paper [Cistola, D. P., Kim, K., Rogl, H., & Frieden, C.

        "abstract": "The denatured states of alpha-lactalbumin, which have features of a molten globule state, have been studied to elucidate the energetics of the molten globule state and its contribution to the stability of the native conformation. Analysis of calorimetric and CD data shows that the heat capacity increment of alpha-lactalbumin denaturation highly correlates with the degree of disorder of the residual structure of the state. As a result, the denaturational transition of alpha-lactalbumin from the native to a highly ordered compact denatured state, and from the native to the disordered unfolded state are described by different thermodynamic functions. The enthalpy and entropy of the denaturation of alpha-lactalbumin to compact denatured state are always greater than the enthalpy and entropy of its unfolding. This difference represents the unfolding of the molten globule state. Calorimetric measurements of the heat effect associated with the unfolding of the molten globule state reveal that it is negative in sign over the temperature range of molten globule stability. This observation demonstrates the energetic specificity of the molten globule state, which, in contrast to a protein with unique tertiary structure, is stabilized by the dominance of negative entropy and enthalpy of hydration over the positive conformational entropy and enthalpy of internal interactions. It is concluded that at physiological temperatures the entropy of dehydration is the dominant factor providing stability for the compact intermediate state on the folding pathway, while for the stability of the native state, the conformational enthalpy is the dominant factor.",

        "abstract": "Apomyoglobin from Aplysia limacina (al-apoMb), despite having only 20 % sequence identity with the more commonly studied mammalian globins (m-apoMbs), properties which result in an increased number of hydrophobic contacts and a loss of most internal salt bridges, shares a number of features of their folding profiles. We show here that it contains an unusually stable core which resists unfolding even at 70 degrees C. The equilibrium intermediate (I(T)) at this high temperature is distinct from the acid unfolded state I(A) which has many properties in common with the acid intermediate observed for the mammalian apoproteins (I(AGH)). It contains a smaller amount of secondary structure (27 % alpha-helical instead of 35 %) and is more highly solvated as evidenced from its fluorescence spectrum (lambda(max)=344 nm instead of 338 nm). Its stability is greatly increased (DeltaDeltaG(w)=-6.75 kcal mol(-1)) in the presence of high salt (2 M KCl), lending support to the view that hydrophobic interactions are responsible for its stability. Kinetic data show classical two-state kinetics between I(A) and the folded state both in the presence and absence of salt. Both I(A) and I(T) can be populated within the dead time of the stopped-flow apparatus, since initiating the refolding reaction from I(T) or I(A) rather than the completely unfolded state does not affect the observed refolding time-course. Our conclusion is that al-apoMb, as other \"apo\" proteins (including for example alpha-lactalbumin in the absence of Ca(2+)), may be described as \"uncoupled\" with an unusually high and exploitable tendency to populate partially folded states.",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the factors stabilizing alpha-helical structure has been greatly enhanced by the study of model alpha-helical peptides. However, the relationship of these results to the folding of helices in intact proteins is not well characterized. Helix propensities measured in model peptides are not in good agreement with those from proteins. In order to address these questions, we have measured helix propensities in the alpha-helix of ribonuclease T1 and a helical peptide of identical sequence. We have previously demonstrated excellent agreement between peptide and protein for the nonpolar amino acids [Myers, J. K., Pace, C. N., and Scholtz, J. M. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 2833-2837]. Most other amino acids also show good agreement, although certain polar amino acids are exceptions. Helix propensities measured in the ribonuclease T1 peptide/protein are compared with those measured in other systems. Reasonable agreement is found between most systems; however, our propensities differ substantially from those measured in several model peptide systems. Alanine-based peptides overestimate the propensity differences by a factor of 2, and host/guest experiments underestimate them by a factor of 2-3.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium denaturation experiments have been performed in order to study the dissociation into monomers and unfolding of the dimeric copper-containing enzyme ascorbate oxidase by urea and guanidine hydrochloride. The process has been followed by fluorescence intensity and anisotropy, by optical density, and by circular dichroism as a function of denaturant concentration. The noncoincidence of the unfolding curves obtained by different techniques suggests that a multiphasic process is occurring. The study of enzymatic activity and aromatic circular dichroism as a function of denaturant concentration shows that the first transition involves a change in the protein tertiary structure which is accompanied by the loss of biological function. Gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and protein dilution experiments demonstrate that a large fraction of protein molecules is still dimeric during this first transition with a stability which is strictly dependent on the denaturant used. The free energy change from the native form to this intermediate species was estimated to be approximately 3.5 kcal/mol. The binding of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid to the partially unfolded, inactive ascorbate oxidase dimer also suggests a large conformational change accompanied by copper release, allowing the probe to penetrate deep inside the protein structure. Further denaturation to give a fully unfolded form is protein concentration dependent, suggesting that dissociation into monomers is occurring. The monomers appear to be very unstable. No evidence for structured intermediates was in fact detected in the last step of the denaturation process. A three-state model has been used to fit the fluorescence data, and the fractions of different species have been calculated as a function of denaturant concentration. The total free energy change of the unfolding transition using either urea or guanidine hydrochloride is rather small ( approximately 15-16 kcal/mol) and quite comparable to the value found for smaller proteins. The loss of secondary structure which occurs in the second part of the unfolding transition may be described by a simple two-state process which is characterized by a free energy change of 12-13 kcal/mol. These results suggest that the folding process of ascorbate oxidase follows a hierarchical model (Jaenicke, 1991). In this context, the assembly of monomers in a dimeric molecule plays a fundamental role by enhancing the protein stability and driving the final organization of the tertiary structure.",

        "abstract": "4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) is a bacterial enzyme that is comprised of 6 identical 62 amino acid subunits. The 4-OT enzyme is an attractive model system in which to study the interrelationship between protein folding, subunit assembly, and catalytic function. Here we report on the GuHCl-induced equilibrium unfolding properties of wild-type 4-OT using catalytic activity measurements and using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the unfolding of wild-type 4-OT in 50 mM phosphate buffers containing 6 M GuHCl is reversible at pHs 6.0, 7.4, and 8.5; and we find that there is both an enzyme concentration dependence and a pH dependence to the equilibrium unfolding properties of 4-OT. Our data suggests that the GuHCl-induced unfolding of 4-OT in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 8.5 can be modeled as a two-state process involving folded hexamer and unfolded monomer. On the basis of this model, we determined a free-energy value for the unfolding of 4-OT at pH 8.5 to be 68.7 +/- 3.2 kcal/mol under standard state conditions (1 M hexamer). In 50 mM phosphate buffers at pHs 6.0 and 7.4, only the catalytic activity denaturation curves are consistent with a two-state folding mechanism. At the lower pHs the far-UV-CD transitions are not well described by a two-state model. Our results at pHs 6.0 and 7.4 suggest that intermediate state(s) are populated in the equilibrium unfolding reaction at these lower pHs and that these intermediate state(s) have some helical content but no measurable catalytic activity.",

When the mutant protein is expressed in the E. coli cytosol, the cysteine sulfur atoms are found, by X-ray crystallographic analysis, to be in van der Waals contact but not covalently bonded to one another. In vitro oxidation by dithionitrobenzoate results in formation of a disulfide bond between residues 39 and 85 with a geometry close to that of the commonly observed left-handed spiral. Comparison of 2.0-A-refined crystal structures of the oxidized (cross-linked) and reduced (un-cross-linked) forms of the mutant enzyme shows that the conformation of the enzyme molecule was not appreciably affected by formation of the disulfide bond but that details of the molecule's thermal motion were altered. The disulfide-cross-linked enzyme is at least 1.8 kcal/mol more stable with respect to unfolding, as measured by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation, than either the wild-type or the reduced (un-cross-linked) mutant enzyme. Nevertheless, the cross-linked form is not more resistant to thermal denaturation. Moreover, the appearance of intermediates in the guanidine hydrochloride denaturation profile and urea-gradient polyacrylamide gels indicates that the folding/unfolding pathway of the disulfide-cross-linked enzyme has changed significantly.",

        "abstract": "PKR (protein kinase R) is induced by interferon and is a key component of the innate immunity antiviral pathway. Upon binding dsRNA, PKR undergoes autophosphorylation reactions that activate the kinase, leading it to phosphorylate eIF2alpha, thus inhibiting protein synthesis in virally infected cells. PKR contains a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) and a kinase domain. The dsRBD is composed of two tandem dsRNA-binding motifs. An autoinhibition model for PKR has been proposed, whereby dsRNA binding activates the enzyme by inducing a conformational change that relieves the latent enzyme of the inhibition that is mediated by the interaction of the dsRBD with the kinase. However, recent biophysical data support an open conformation for the latent enzyme, where activation is mediated by dimerization of PKR induced upon binding dsRNA. We have probed the importance of interdomain contacts by comparing the relative stabilities of isolated domains with the same domain in the context of the intact enzyme using equilibrium chemical denaturation experiments. The two dsRNA-binding motifs fold independently, with the C-terminal motif exhibiting greater stability. The kinase domain is stabilized by about 1.5 kcal/mol in the context of the holenzyme, and we detect low-affinity binding of the kinase and dsRBD constructs in solution, indicating that these domains interact weakly. Limited proteolysis measurements confirm the expected domain boundaries and reveal that the activation loop in the kinase is accessible to cleavage and unstructured. Autophosphorylation induces a conformation change that blocks proteolysis of the activation loop.",

        "abstract": "Two murine interleukin-6 (mIL-6) variants were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), one lacking the last five residues (183-187) at the C-terminus (pMC5) and another with the last five residues of mIL-6 substituted by the corresponding residues of human IL-6 (pMC5H). The growth stimulatory activity of pMC5 on the mouse hybridoma cell line 7TD1 was < 0.05% of mIL-6, whereas pMC5H and mIL-6 were equipotent. The loss of biological activity of pMC5 correlated with its negligible receptor binding affinity on 7TD1 cells, while the binding of pMC5H was comparable to that of mIL-6. Both pMC5 and pMC5H, like mIL-6, failed to interact with recombinant soluble human IL-6 receptor when assayed by surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor analysis. These studies suggest that the C-terminal seven amino acids of human IL-6, alone, do not define species specificity for receptor binding. A variety of biophysical techniques, as well as the binding of a conformational-specific monoclonal antibody, indicated that the global fold of the mIL-6 variants was similar to that of mIL-6, although small changes in the NMR spectra, particularly for pMC5, were observed. Some of these changes involved residues widely separated in the primary structure. For instance, interactions involving Tyr-22 were influenced by the C-terminal amino acids suggesting that the N- and C-termini of mIL-6 are in close proximity. Equilibrium unfolding experiments indicated that pMC5 was 0.8 kcal/mol less stable than mIL-6, whereas pMC5H was 1.4 kcal/mol more stable. These studies emphasize the structural importance of the C-terminal amino acids of IL-6 and suggest that truncation or mutation of this region could lead to small but significant alterations in other regions of the molecule.",

        "abstract": "The S-adenosyl- l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolases (SAHH) from Homo sapiens (Hs-SAHH) and from the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc-SAHH) are very similar in structure and catalytic properties but differ in the kinetics and thermodynamics of association and dissociation of the cofactor NAD (+). The binding of NAD (+) and NADH in SAHH appears structurally to be mediated by helix 18, formed by seven residues near the C-terminus of the adjacent subunit. Helix-propensity estimates indicate decreasing stability of helix 18 in the order Hs-SAHH > Tc-SAHH > Ld-SAHH (from Leishmania donovani) > Pf-SAHH (from Plasmodium falciparum), which would be consistent with the previous observations. Here we report the properties of Hs-18Pf-SAHH, the human enzyme with plasmodial helix 18, and Tc-18Hs-SAHH, the trypanosomal enzyme with human helix 18. Hs-18Tc-SAHH, the human enzyme with trypanosomal helix 18, was also prepared but differed insignificantly from Hs-SAHH. Association of NAD (+) with Hs-SAHH, Hs-18Pf-SAHH, Tc-18Hs-SAHH, and Tc-SAHH exhibited biphasic kinetics for all enzymes. A thermal maximum in rate, attributed to the onset of local structural alterations in or near the binding site, occurred at 35, 33, 30, and 15 degrees C, respectively. This order is consistent with some reversible changes within helix 18 but does require influence of other properties of the \"host enzyme\". Dissociation of NAD (+) from the same series of enzymes also exhibited biphasic kinetics with a transition to faster rates (a larger entropy of activation more than compensates for a larger enthalpy of activation) at temperatures of 41, 38, 36, and 29 degrees C, respectively. This order is also consistent with changes in helix 18 but again requiring influence of other properties of the \"host enzyme\". Global unfolding of all fully reconstituted holoenzymes occurred around 63 degrees C, confirming that the kinetic transition temperatures did not arise from a major disruption of the protein structure.",

Protection factors for the slowly exchanging hydrogens in unligated nuclease H124L at 37 degrees C and pH 5.5 were found to vary by over one order of magnitude. This range of protection factors has been interpreted in the framework of global and local structural fluctuations. The three most highly protected hydrogens (K24, L25, M26) map to strand 2 of the central five-stranded beta-barrel. The free energy change for the opening reaction which exposes these hydrogens to the solvent (delta G(degree)op) was calculated from the exchange rates in the native and denatured states, the latter values being estimated from model peptide exchange studies [Molday, R. S., Englander, S. W., & Kallen, R. G. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 150-158]. Close agreement was found between delta G(degree)op and delta G(degree)u, the free energy change of unfolding as measured by urea denaturation experiments. Exchange of these hydrogens thus appears to occur via global unfolding of the protein. One region exhibited somewhat lower protection factors: it mapped to the C-terminal portions of helix 2 and helix 3 and to part of the intervening segment. This region has been identified as a minor hydrophobic domain of nuclease [Shortle, D., Stites, W. E., & Meeker, A. K. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8033-8041].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A histidine-auxotrophic strain was grown to stationary phase by histidine limitation in a synthetic medium, then Taz was added on induction to produce a lysozyme with approximately 75% incorporation. The Taz-containing enzyme precipitated selectively from the cytoplasm and was purified after renaturation. Replacement by Taz had only very minor effects on the activity-pH profile of the enzyme, in contrast with the great perturbations observed for the Asn48 mutant. The relative stabilities of the His48-lambdaL and Taz48-lambdaL mutants were also studied as a function of pH; the results are discussed with regard to the poor accessibility of His48, the low basicity of Taz and the hydrogen bonding patterns suggested by the crystal structure. At neutral pH, Taz48-lambdaL is less stable than His48-lambdaL by approximately 3.5 kcal/mol, probably as a result of the loss of a hydrogen bond in the native form of Taz48-lambdaL. Lowering the pH leads to a progressive stabilization of Taz48-lambdaL relative to His48-lambdaL because of the abnormally low pKa of His48 in the native form of His48-lambdaL.",

Six mutants (I23C, S53C, V60C, L72C, L89C, and A104C) with a single cysteine residue substituted for a hydrophobic residue were characterized by their stability toward denaturants at pH 7.2 and 9.6, by their fluorescent properties, and by their reactivity toward the sulfhydryl modifying reagents 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and 4,4'-dipyridyl disulfide (4-PDS). In terms of protein stability, the substitutions were reasonably conservative with only two (V60C and L89C) being somewhat less stable than the wild-type. The mutant proteins differed considerably, however, in their reactivity toward the modifying reagents. One residue, Cys89, located in a hydrophobic core near a turn between two beta-strands, was unreactive, while two residues, Cys60 and Cys104, located in the middle of beta-strands in the cavity into which fatty acid binds, reacted only very slowly and were further protected by oleate. Cys53, located near a turn and partially buried, appeared to have an unusually low pK value. Two residues, Cys23 and Cys72, reacted more rapidly in the native protein than in the unfolded protein. Both residues are located near the portal for the fatty acid binding, and one, Cys72, was strongly protected from modification by the presence of oleate. Examination of the crystal structure indicates that Cys72 is not easily solvent-accessible. We conclude that this high reactivity for this residue may be a consequence of rapid conformational flexibility in this region of the structure.",

The helix formation of the nine amino acid residue segment Lys-Gln-Ala-Val-Asp-Asn-Ala-Tyr-Ala of helix E from subtilisin Carlsberg has been studied by the construction of a hybrid consisting of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) where part of the active loop has been replaced by the nonapeptide. An expression system for a truncated form of CI2 where the 19 structureless residues of the N-terminus have been removed and Leu20 replaced by methionyl was constructed from the entire 83-residue wild-type CI2 gene by polymerase chain reaction methodology. The gene encoding the hybrid was constructed from the truncated inhibitor gene. The stability of the truncated inhibitor and of the hybrid toward guanidinium chloride denaturation was examined. From these measurements, the energy of unfolding in pure water was extrapolated to 30.5 +/- 1.0 kJ/mol for the truncated inhibitor and 10.9 +/- 0.3 kJ/mol for the hybrid. These energies show that the stability of CI2 is unaffected by the N-terminal truncation but severely decreased by the loop mutations. The three-dimensional structure of the hybrid protein has been determined in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using 893 distance restraints and 84 torsional angle restraints. The average root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 15 structures compared to their geometrical average was 0.8 +/- 0.2 A for heavy backbone atoms and 1.3 +/- 0.2 A for all heavy atoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Using hen egg white lysozyme as a model protein, we present data that clearly demonstrate the suppression of the aggregation of denatured protein by L-Arg. By chemical modification of free cysteines, a series of unfolded lysozyme species were obtained that served as models for unfolded and intermediate states during the process of oxidative refolding. An increased equilibrium solubility of unfolded species and intermediates in the presence of L-Arg seems to be its major mechanism of action.",

        "abstract": "Glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP) from Escherichia coli is a monomeric protein localized in the periplasmic space of the bacterium. It is responsible for the first step in the active transport of L-glutamine across the cytoplasmic membrane. The protein consists of two similar globular domains linked by two peptide hinges, and X-ray crystallographic data indicate that the two domains undergo large movements upon ligand binding. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to analyze the structure and thermal stability of the protein in detail. The data indicate that glutamine binding induces small changes in the secondary structure of the protein and that it renders the structure more thermostable and less flexible. Detailed analyses of IR spectra show a lower thermal sensitivity of alpha-helices than beta-sheets in the protein both in the absence and in the presence of glutamine. Generalized two-dimensional (2D) analyses of IR spectra reveal the same sequence of unfolding events in the protein in the absence and in the presence of glutamine, indicating that the amino acid does not affect the unfolding pathway of the protein. The data give new insight into the structural characteristics of GlnBP that are useful for both basic knowledge and biotechnological applications.",

        "abstract": "Tetrameric phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Bacillus stearothermophilus can be described as a dimer of dimers with three nonequivalent interfaces. To investigate the contribution of intra- and intersubunit interactions to GAPDH thermostability, 10 residues located either at the cofactor domain (amino acids 1-148 and 313-333) or at the catalytic domain (amino acids 149-312) were mutated and the thermal unfolding of the mutants was studied by differential scanning calorimetry in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of NAD. Disruptions of intrasubunit interactions lead to a drastic decrease in thermostability of the N313T, Y283V, and W310F mutants. Moreover, for the N313T mutant, a weakening of cooperative interactions between the catalytic and the cofactor domains and an inefficient binding of NAD are observed. This is likely the consequences of modification or loss of the hydrogen bonding network associating N313 and residues 236-238 and N313 and the nicotinamide carboxyamide of NAD, respectively. For the residues Y283 and W310, which are involved in stacking hydrophobic interactions, mutating both positions does not affect the efficiency of NAD binding. This shows that the factors involved in the thermostability of the tetrameric apo GAPDH are then different from those induced by NAD binding. Disruption of intersubunit hydrogen bonds between the catalytic domain and the NAD-binding domain of a neighboring subunit also leads to a significant destabilization of the apo tetrameric form as observed for the D282G mutant. Moreover, no efficient binding of NAD is observed. Both results are likely the consequence of a loss of hydrogen bonds across the P-axis and the Q-axis between D282 and R197 and between D282 and R52, respectively. Similar results, i.e., a destabilizing effect and inefficient NAD binding, are observed with the T34Q/T39S/L43Q mutant in which steric hindrance is introduced at the S-loop of the R-axis-related subunit via mutations at the adenosine subsite. The dimeric form of the D282G mutant exhibits a single partial heat absorption peak, whereas the Y46G/R52G mutant which exists only as a dimer shows two peaks. Taking into account the recent small-angle X-ray scattering studies which suggested that the dimeric form of the D282G mutant and of the dimeric Y46G/R52G mutant are of the O-R and O-P types, respectively (Vachette, unpublished results), we propose that the presence of one or two peaks in thermal unfolding of dimers is a signature of the dimer type.",

This engineering has significantly altered the activity of the enzyme to aggregated and monomeric substrates. A N89D/E92K mutant is more stable but considerably less active than wild type. An N89D mutant is more stable and of similar activity to wild type. The substantial change in activity may be due to direct interaction of residue 92 with aggregated substrate or may be via second calcium binding. Second calcium binding may be more probable as activity against monomers is also affected. Additional calcium binding may therefore be an important way of manipulating the activity of phospholipase A2.",

For some measurements, reduced thioredoxin was further reacted with iodoacetamide to alkylate the cysteinyl residues. The denaturation transitions of oxidized, reduced, and reduced alkylated thioredoxin were observed by using far-ultraviolet circular dichroic and exclusion chromatographic measurements. Cleavage of the disulfide bond lowers the stability of the native thioredoxin to denaturation by about 2.4 kcal/mol, and subsequent alkylation lowers the stability by a further 1.6 kcal/mol. The kinetics of the conformational change of reduced thioredoxin in guanidine hydrochloride were observed by using exclusion chromatography at moderate pressure and 2 degrees C. Analyses of single and multimixing protocols are consistent with a predominant nonnative configuration in the denatured state and the transient accumulation of a compact nativelike intermediate during refolding. The intermediate can incorporate the nonnative configuration and can accommodate its isomerization. No compelling chromatographic evidence was found for a conformation having an elution time different from that characteristic for either the native or the denatured protein.",

By decreasing the heating rate or increasing the transition temperature, the denaturation of RNase approaches an equilibrium two-state transition. This permits determination of the thermodynamic parameters characterizing unfolding of the native structure. These thermodynamic parameters were correlated with the structural features of protein. Analysis of different contributions to the stability of RNase T1 shows that van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding are the major contributors to the conformational stability of the protein.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of beta-sheet formation remains a fundamental issue in our understanding of the protein folding process, but is hampered by the often encountered kinetic competition between folding and aggregation. The role of local versus nonlocal interactions has been probed traditionally by mutagenesis of both turn and strand residues. Recently, rigid organic molecules that impose a correct chain reversal have been introduced in several small peptides to isolate the importance of the long-range interactions. Here, we present the incorporation of a well-studied beta-turn mimic, designated as the dibenzofuran-based (DBF) amino acid, in the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (B1G), and compare our results with those obtained upon insertion of the same mimic into the N-terminal beta-hairpin of B1G (O Melnyk et al., 1998, Lett Pept Sci 5:147-150). The DBF-B1G domain conserves the structure and the functional and thermodynamical properties of the native protein, whereas the modified peptide does not adopt a native-like conformation. The nature of the DBF flanking residues in the modified B1G domain prevents the beta-turn mimic from acting as a strong beta-sheet nucleator, which reinforces the idea that the native beta-hairpin formation is not driven by the beta-turn formation, but by tertiary interactions.",

Deletion of C-terminal 14 amino acids of the SH3 domain of BTK results in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), an inherited disease. We report here on the stability and folding of SH3 domain of BTK. Peptides corresponding to residues 216-273 (58 residues) and 216-259 (44 residues) of BTK SH3 domain were synthesized by solid phase methods; the first peptide constitutes the entire SH3 domain of BTK while the latter peptide lacks 14 amino acid residues of the C-terminal. The 58 amino acid peptide forms mainly a beta-barrel type folding unit. Although small and lacking disulfide bonds, this peptide is extremely stable to thermal denaturation. Based on circular dichroism measurements, its melting temperature was found to be high, 82 degrees C at pH 6.0. However, the Gibbs free energy (delta GH2O) of the intrinsic stability and thermodynamic spontaneity of unfolding were found to be low, 2.6 kcal/mol by Gdn.HCl denaturation experiments, as compared to 12 kcal/mol obtained for larger single domain proteins, indicating poor stability of SH3 domain. Addition of 500 mM of Na2SO4 increased the free energy change delta GH2O to 4.0 kcal/mol, suggesting an ionic strength effect. The truncated peptide fails to fold correctly and adopts random coil conformation in contrast to 58 amino acid beta-barrel peptide, which exhibits high thermal stability but normal or low stability at ambient temperature. These results, to our knowledge the first to delineate the importance of C-terminal in structural integrity of SH3 domains, indicate also that improper folding and/or poor stability of mutant SH3 domain in BTK likely causes XLA.",

The premise underlying the selection scheme is that binding of protein L to IgG requires that the protein be properly folded. Using a combination of molecular biological and biophysical methods, we show that this assumption is valid. First, the phage selection procedure strongly selects against a point mutation in protein L that disrupts folding but is not in the IgG binding interface. Second, variants recovered from a library in which the first third of protein L was randomized are properly folded. The degree of sequence variation in the selected population is striking: the variants have as many as nine substitutions in the 14 residues that were mutagenized. The approach provides a selection for \"foldedness\" that is potentially applicable to any small binding protein.",

        "abstract": "Rational site-directed mutagenesis and biophysical analyses have been used to explore the thermodynamic stability and catalytic capabilities of organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) and its genetically modified variants. There are clear trade-offs in the stability of modifications that enhance catalytic activities. For example, the H254R/H257L variant has higher turnover numbers for the chemical warfare agents VX (144 versus 14 s(-1) for the native enzyme (wild type) and VR (Russian VX, 465 versus 12 s(-1) for wild type). These increases are accompanied by a loss in stability in which the total Gibb's free energy for unfolding is 19.6 kcal/mol, which is 5.7 kcal/mol less than that of the wild-type enzyme. X-ray crystallographic studies support biophysical data that suggest amino acid residues near the active site contribute to the chemical and thermal stability through hydrophobic and cation-pi interactions. The cation-pi interactions appear to contribute an additional 7 kcal/mol to the overall global stability of the enzyme. Using rational design, it has been possible to make amino acid changes in this region that restored the stability, yet maintained effective V-agent activities, with turnover numbers of 68 and 36 s(-1) for VX and VR, respectively. This study describes the first rationally designed, stability/activity balance for an OPH enzyme with a legitimate V-agent activity, and its crystal structure.",

We have prepared a derivative of ribonuclease T1 in which one disulfide bond is broken and the cysteine residues carboxymethylated, (2-10)-RCM-T1, and three derivatives in which both disulfides are broken and the cysteine residues reduced, R-T1, carboxamidomethylated, RCAM-T1, or carboxymethylated, RCM-T1. The RNA hydrolyzing activity of these proteins has been measured, and urea and thermal denaturation studies have been used to determine conformational stability. The activity, melting temperature, and conformational stability of the proteins are: ribonuclease T1 (100%, 59.3 degrees C, 10.2 kcal/mol), (2-10)-RCM-T1 (86%, 53.3 degrees C, 6.8 kcal/mol), R-T1 (53%, 27.2 degrees C, 3.0 kcal/mol), RCAM-T1 (43%, 21.2 degrees C, 1.5 kcal/mol), and RCM-T1 (35%, 16.6 degrees C, 0.9 kcal/mol). Thus, the conformational stability is decreased by 3.4 kcal/mol when one disulfide bond is broken and by 7.2-9.3 kcal/mol when both disulfide bonds are broken. It is quite remarkable that RNase T1 can fold and function with both disulfide bonds broken and the cysteine residues carboxymethylated. The large decrease in the stability is due mainly to an increase in the conformational entropy of the unfolded protein which results when the constraints of the disulfide bonds on the flexibility are removed. We propose a new equation for predicting the effect of a cross-link on the conformational entropy of a protein: delta Sconf = -2.1 - (3/2)R 1n n, where n is the number of residues between the side chains which are cross-linked. This equation gives much better agreement with experimental results than other forms of this equation which have been used previously.",

It belongs to the large and versatile family of (betaalpha)(8)-barrel enzymes but has an unusual N-terminal extension of about 40 residues. Limited proteolysis with trypsin of IGPS from both Sulfolobus solfataricus (sIGPS) and Thermotoga maritima (tIGPS) removes about 25 N-terminal residues and one of the two extra helices contained therein. To assess the role of the extension, the N-terminally truncated variants sIGPSDelta(1-26) and tIGPSDelta(1-25) were produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized in comparison to the wild-type enzymes. Both sIGPSDelta(1-26) and tIGPSDelta(1-25) have unchanged oligomerization states and turnover numbers. In contrast, their Michaelis constants for the substrate 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate are increased, and their resistance toward unfolding induced by heat and guanidinium chloride is decreased. sIGPSDelta(1-26) was crystallized, and its X-ray structure was solved at 2.8 A resolution. The comparison with the known structure of sIGPS reveals small differences that account for its reduced substrate affinity and protein stability. The structure of the core of sIGPSDelta(1-26) is, however, unchanged compared to sIGPS, explaining its retained catalytic activity and consistent with the idea that it evolved from the same ancestor as the phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase and the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase.

        "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies have been performed to investigate the structural properties of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) obtained from the same donor. In addition, a comparison was made between autologous LDL and the remnant particle Lp(a-) obtained by removal of apo(a) through chemical reduction. With Lp(a), three distinct thermal transitions have been observed: the first one around 20 degrees C, arising from the core-located apolar lipids, similar to LDL but with a significantly lower melting temperature as compared to LDL of the same donor. The second one, at 55.7 +/- 0.25 degrees C, can be attributed to apo(a), since it was found to be absent in Lp(a-) and LDL, whereas isolated apo(a) in aqueous solution exhibited a similar transition. The third transition, at 80.4 +/- 0.9 degrees C, corresponds to apo-B100 protein unfolding. The low melting temperature of the core lipids in Lp(a) is preserved in Lp(a-); this suggests that the apolar lipid interactions are unaffected by apo(a) binding, and that the difference in the core melting behavior between Lp(a) and LDL is due to a different stabilization through interaction between the apolar core and the surface monolayer lipids. SAXS curves exhibited qualitatively the same characteristic features for LDL, Lp(a), and Lp(a-). Thus, the SAXS results showed that no major deviations from spherical particle shape occur with Lp(a), indicating that apo(a) wraps around the particle surface without major globular protrusions into the aqueous surrounding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "How valid are denaturant-induced unfolding free energy measurements? Level of conformance to common assumptions over an extended range of ribonuclease A stability.", 
        "abstract": "A thermodynamic cycle is used to explore a host of assumptions, conditions, and criteria which must be met for evaluation of authentic unfolding free energy changes. The thermodynamic cycle involves measurement of the unfolding free energy change (delta GzeroN-U) for RNase A at a reference pH, along with determination of the titration free energy changes for the native and unfolded species over an extended pH range. From these free energy changes, delta GzeroN-U at any pH in the range can be predicted and compared with delta GzeroN-U determined by use of the linear extrapolation method (LEM). Good agreement is found between predicted and determined free energy changes covering a broad range of protein stability changes (5 kcal/mol), pH (pH from 3 to 8.5), and lengths of linear extrapolation (C1/2 values from 2.4 to 7.7 M urea). The agreement between predicted and LEM-determined delta GzeroN-U values demonstrates (1) that delta GzeroN-U determined by the LEM is a function of state; i.e., it has the properties of additivity and independence of pathway required of an authentic free energy quantity; (2) the ability to obtain delta GzeroN-U values which are in agreement with the free energy change predicted by the cycle is independent of the length of linear extrapolation; and (3) the two-state assumption holds over an extensive pH range. The fact that the pH titration curve of unfolded RNase A in 6 M GdnHCl could be used in accurately predicting urea-induced delta GzeroN-U values shows that the unfolded ensemble in 6 M GdnHCl is thermodynamically identical to urea-unfolded RNase A as far as the pH dependence of protein stability is concerned. Urea-induced and GdnHCl-induced RNase A delta GzeroN-U values at pH 3 were found not to agree with one another, but this appears to be due to the inability to control the salt effect of GdnHCl on the native state of RNase A. These results provide strong evidence that the LEM applied to urea-induced unfolding of RNase A results in reliable free energy changes that meet a number of essential criteria for authentic thermodynamic quantities. The titration method is important in its own right in providing a means for evaluating the pH dependence of two-state protein unfolding free energy changes which does not require analysis of denaturant-induced unfolding transitions.",

        "abstract": "Sheep is a unique example among mammalian species to present a strong correlation between genotype and prion disease susceptibility phenotype. Indeed a well-defined set of PrP polymorphisms at positions 136, 154 and 171 (sheep numbering) govern scrapie susceptibility, ranging from very high susceptibility for V136-R154-Q171 variant (VRQ) to resistance for A136-R154-R171 variant (ARR). To get better insight into the molecular mechanisms of scrapie susceptibility/resistance, the unfolding pathways of the different full-length recombinant sheep prion protein variants were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry in a wide range of pH. In the pH range 4.5-6.0, thermal unfolding occurs through a reversible one-step process while at pH <4.5 and >6.0 unfolding intermediates are formed, which are stable in the temperature range 65-80 degrees C. While these general behaviours are shared by all variants, VRQ and ARQ (susceptibility variants) show higher thermal stability than AHQ and ARR (resistance variants) and the formation of their unfolding intermediates requires higher activation energy than in the case of AHQ and ARR. Furthermore, secondary structures of the unfolding intermediates differentiate variants: ARR unfolding intermediate exhibits random coil structure, contrasting with the beta-sheet structure of VRQ and ARQ unfolding intermediates. The rate of the unfolding intermediate formation allows us to classify genetic variants along increasing scrapie susceptibility at pH 4.0, VRQ and ARQ rates being the highest. Rather poor correlation is observed at pH 7.2. Upon cooling, these intermediates refold into stable species, which are rich in beta-type secondary structures and, as revealed by thioflavin T fluorescence and electron microscopy, share amyloid characteristics. These results highlight the prion protein plasticity genetically modulated in sheep, and might provide a molecular basis for sheep predisposition to scrapie taking into account both thermodynamic stability and transconformation rate of prion protein.",

        "abstract": "Allium sativum agglutinin (ASAI) is a heterodimeric mannose-specific bulb lectin possessing two polypeptide chains of molecular mass 11.5 and 12.5 kDa. The thermal unfolding of ASAI, characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, shows it to be highly reversible and can be defined as a two-state process in which the folded dimer is converted directly to the unfolded monomers (A2 if 2U). Its conformational stability has been determined as a function of temperature, GdnCl concentration, and pH using a combination of thermal and isothermal GdnCl-induced unfolding monitored by DSC, far-UV CD, and fluorescence, respectively. Analyses of these data yielded the heat capacity change upon unfolding (DeltaC(p) and also the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic parameters, namely, DeltaG, DeltaH, and DeltaS. The fit of the stability curve to the modified Gibbs-Helmholtz equation provides an estimate of the thermodynamic parameters DeltaH(g), DeltaS(g), and DeltaC(p) as 174.1 kcal x mol(-1), 0.512 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1), and 3.41 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1), respectively, at T(g) = 339.4 K. Also, the free energy of unfolding, DeltaG(s), at its temperature of maximum stability (T(s) = 293 K) is 13.13 kcal x mol(-1). Unlike most oligomeric proteins studied so far, the lectin shows excellent agreement between the experimentally determined DeltaC(p) (3.2 +/- 0.28 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1)) and those evaluated from a calculation of its accessible surface area. This in turn suggests that the protein attains a completely unfolded state irrespective of the method of denaturation. The absence of any folding intermediates suggests the quaternary interactions to be the major contributor to the conformational stability of the protein, which correlates well with its X-ray structure. The small DeltaC(p) for the unfolding of ASAI reflects a relatively small, buried hydrophobic core in the folded dimeric protein.",

        "abstract": "The mechanical unfolding of an immunoglobulin domain from the human muscle protein titin (TI I27) has been shown to proceed via a metastable intermediate in which the A-strand is detached. The structure and properties of this intermediate are characterised in this study. A conservative destabilising mutation in the A-strand has no effect on the unfolding force, nor the dependence of the unfolding force on the pulling speed, indicating that the unfolding forces measured in an AFM experiment are those required for the unfolding of the intermediate and not the native state. A mutant of TI I27 with the A-strand deleted (TI I27-A) is studied by NMR and standard biophysical techniques, combined with protein engineering. Molecular dynamics simulations show TI I27-A to be a good model for the intermediate. It has a structure very similar to the native state, and is surprisingly stable. Comparison with a Phi-value analysis of the unfolding pathway clearly shows that the protein unfolds by a different pathway under an applied force than on addition of denaturant.",

        "abstract": "We have refined the X-ray structure of a site-directed G152A mutant of the iron-dependent superoxide dismutase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis at 2.9 angstroms resolution. The mutation which replaces a glycine residue in a surface loop with alanine was designed to alter the conformation of this loop region which has previously been shown to play a crucial structural role in quaternary interactions within the SOD tetramer. Gly-152 was targeted as it has dihedral angles (phi = 83.1 degrees, psi = -0.3 degrees) close to the left-handed alpha-helical conformation which is rarely adopted by other amino acids except asparagine. Gly-152 was replaced by alanine as it has similar size and polarity, yet has a very low tendency to adopt similar conformations. X-ray data collection on crystals of this mutant at 2.9 angstroms resolution and subsequent least-squares refinement to an R-value of 0.169 clearly establish that the loop conformation is unaffected. Fluorescence studies of guanidine hydrochloride denaturation establish that the mutant is 4 kcal/mol less stable than the wild-type enzyme. Our results indicate that strict conformational constraints imposed upon a region of polypeptide, due for example to interactions with a neighbouring subunit, may force an alanine residue to adopt this sterically hindered conformation with a consequent reduction in stability of the folded conformation.",

In homodimeric beta B2-crystallin, the extended conformation of the connecting peptide has been suggested to force the beta B2-molecule to favor intermolecular domain interactions compared with intramolecular contacts in monomeric gamma B-crystallin. From this one may postulate that the conserved interdomain contacts are essential for the overall stability of crystallins. This was clearly confirmed for gamma B-crystallin, since its isolated C-terminal domain is significantly less stable than in the context of native gamma B. Exchanging the linker peptide of gamma B- for that of beta B2-crystallin yields a monomeric protein with stability characteristics identical to gamma B-crystallin. We conclude that the domain-interface itself rather than the connecting peptide determines the mode of domain association in crystallins, as the linker in the gamma B beta-mutant is evidently twisted to a turn similar to the one in natural gamma B-crystallin.",

        "abstract": "Circular permutation of a protein covalently links its original termini and creates new ends at another location. To maintain the stability of the permuted structure, the termini are typically bridged by a peptide long enough to span the original distance between them. Here, we take the opposite approach and employ a very short linker to introduce conformational strain into a protein by forcing its termini together. We join the N- and C-termini of the small ribonuclease barnase (normally 27.2 A distant) with a single Cys residue and introduce new termini at a surface loop, to create pBn. Compared to a similar variant permuted with an 18-residue linker, permutation with a single amino acid dramatically destabilizes barnase. Surprisingly, pBn is folded at 10 degrees C and possesses near wild-type ribonuclease activity. The 2.25 A X-ray crystal structure of pBn reveals how the barnase fold is able to adapt to permutation, partially defuse conformational strain, and preserve enzymatic function. We demonstrate that strain in pBn can be relieved by cleaving the linker with a chemical reagent. Catalytic activity of both uncleaved (strained) pBn and cleaved (relaxed) pBn is proportional to their thermodynamic stabilities, i.e., the fraction of folded molecules. The stability and activity of cleaved pBn are dependent on protein concentration. At concentrations above approximately 2 microM, cleaving pBn is predicted to increase the fraction of folded molecules and thus enhance ribonuclease activity at 37 degrees C. This study suggests that introducing conformational strain by permutation, and releasing strain by cleavage, is a potential mechanism for engineering an artificial zymogen.",

Proteins which lack adequate signal of circular dichroism may require unconventional technique. Secretory Leucocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) is a 107 amino acids protein with a high density of disulfide pairing (eight). The native SLPI has no hydrophobic core and contains very little hydrogen bonded secondary structure [Gruetter, M., Fendrich, G., Huber, R., and Bode, W.

In this study, conformational stability of SLPI has been investigated by the method of disulfide scrambling, which permits quantification of the native and denatured (scrambled) proteins by HPLC. Due to high heterogeneity of denatured SLPI, the native and scrambled SLPI are extensively overlapped on HPLC. This impediment was further overcome by the development of a novel method which distinguishes the native and scrambled isomers of SLPI by exploiting the relative stability of their disulfide bonds. The study reveals mid-point denaturation of SLPI at 1.36 M of GdmSCN, 4.0 M of GdmCl and >8 M urea. Based on the GdmCl denaturation curve, the unfolding free energy (DeltaG(H20)) of SLPI was estimated to be 4.56 kcal/mol. The results of our studies suggest an alternative strategy for analyzing conformational stability of disulfide proteins that are not suitable to the conventional spectroscopic techniques.",

The far-ultraviolet (UV) CD spectra of five mutant alpha subunits with Ala in place of Pro were identical to the spectrum of the wild-type protein, the exception being the mutant at position 207 (P207A). CD values in the far-UV region were less negative for P207A, indicating that the Pro residue at position 207 plays a role in maintaining the intact structure of the alpha subunit. The negative CD values of the Gly mutants examined (P28G, P96G, and P132G) were also decreased. Calorimetric measurements showed that the two mutants at position 28 (P28G and P28A) gave two peaks in the excess heat capacity curve, whereas the wild type and other Pro mutants had only a single peak. The stability of each mutant protein relative to that of the wild type was about the same for P57A, less for P62A and P132A, and markedly decreased for P96A and P207A, which are substituted at less mobile positions. The changes of denaturation entropy (delta delta dS) at the denaturation temperature of the wild-type protein (54.1 degrees C at pH 9.0) were positive for P57A, P62A, and P132A, but negative for P96A, P207A, and P132G.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Variation in temperature from 1 degrees to 91 degrees C transformed the peptides from predominantly helical to predominantly disordered state. Amplitude and position of the infrared amide I' absorption bands from (12)C- and (13)C-labeled segments provided information about the helical content. Temperature dependence of infrared spectra was used to estimate segmental stability. As a control measure of overall peptide stability and helicity (independent of labeling), the temperature dependence of circular dichroism spectra in the far-UV range at identical conditions (temperature and solvent) as infrared spectra was measured. The results indicate that the central quarter of the 32 amino acids helix has the maximal helicity and stability. The midpoint of the melting curve of the central quarter of the helix is 5.4 +/- 0.8 degrees C higher than that of the termini.

        "abstract": "It is widely accepted that solvent-exposed sites in proteins play only a negligible role in determining protein energetics. In this paper we show that amino acid substitutions at the fully exposed Lys15 in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) influenced the CD- and DSC-monitored stability: The T(den) difference between the least (P1 Trp) and the most stable (P1 His) mutant is 11.2 degrees C at pH 2.0. The DeltaH(den) versus T(den) plot for all the variants at three pH values (2.0, 2.5, 3.0) is linear (DeltaC(p,den) = 0.41 kcal* mole(-1) * K(-1); 1 cal = 4.18 J) leading to a DeltaG(den) difference of 2.1 kcal*mole(-1). Thermal denaturation of the variants monitored by CD signal at pH 2.0 in the presence of 6 M GdmCl again showed differences in their stability, albeit somewhat smaller (DeltaT(den) =7.1 degrees C). Selective reduction of the Cys14-Cys 38 disulfide bond, which is located in the vicinity of the P1 position did not eliminate the stability differences. A correlation analysis of the P1 stability with different properties of amino acids suggests that two mechanisms may be responsible for the observed stability differences: the reverse hydrophobic effect and amino acid propensities to occur in nonoptimal dihedral angles adopted by the P1 position. The former effect operates at the denatured state level and causes a drop in protein stability for hydrophobic side chains, due to their decreased exposure upon denaturation. The latter factor influences the native state energetics and results from intrinsic properties of amino acids in a way similar to those observed for secondary structure propensities. In conclusion, our results suggest that the protein-stability-derived secondary structure propensity scales should be taken with more caution.",

        "abstract": "To determine the effects of different amino acids on the structure and stability of an alpha-helix in the context of a globular protein, all 19 naturally-occurring amino acids were substituted for Ser44 in phage T4 lysozyme. A more restricted set of nine replacements was also made for Val131. Ser44 and Val131 are two of a very limited number of possible sites in T4 lysozyme that are well within alpha-helices, are solvent-exposed and relatively free of interactions with neighboring residues, and are not involved in crystal contacts. High resolution structures for the majority of the mutants, some of which crystallized non-isomorphously with wild-type, were determined. With the exception of proline, the amino acid substitutions caused little if any perturbation of the alpha-helix backbone. Also the beta-branched residues Thr, Val and Ile show no indication of either side-chain or backbone distortion. Therefore, other than proline, there is no evidence that differences in helix propensities are associated with different amounts of strain introduced into the helix. For reference, and also to allow estimates of side-chain entropy, a survey was made of side-chain conformations in 100 well-refined protein structures. As noted previously all side-chains within alpha-helices strongly avoid the g- conformation (chi 1 approximately 60 degrees). This restricts the beta-branched residues Thr, Val and Ile to a single conformer (g+, chi 1 approximately -60 degrees). Asp, Asn, Met and Ser within helices also overwhelmingly prefer the g+ conformation. For Arg, Cys, Gln, Glu, Leu and Lys the t (chi 1 approximately 180 degrees) and g+ conformers are populated roughly equally. Only the aromatic residues, His, Tyr, Trp and Phe prefer the t conformation. These preferences are the same whether the side-chain is buried or solvent-exposed. In general, the side-chain conformations adopted by the residues substituted at positions 44 and 131 correspond to the most commonly observed conformation for the same amino acid in helices in known protein structures. The changes in protein stability for the replacements at site 131 in general agree well with those at site 44 (correlation r = 0.97), suggesting that these may be representative of substitutions at fully solvent-exposed sites in the middle of alpha-helices. The free energy values also agree quite well with those observed for equivalent replacements in a number of soluble alpha-helical model peptides and with data from \"host-guest\" studies and statistical surveys (r = 0.69 to 0.93).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 (OM b5) is the most thermostable cytochrome b5 isoform presently known. Herein, we show that OM b5 thermal stability is substantially enhanced by swapping an apparently invariant motif in its heme-independent folding core with the corresponding motif characteristic of its less stable evolutionary relative, microsomal cytochrome b5 (Mc b5). The motif swap involved replacing two residues, Arg15 with His and Glu20 with Ser, thereby introducing a Glu11-His15-Ser20 H-bonding triad on the protein surface along with a His15/Trp22 pi-stacking interaction. The ferric and ferrous forms of the OM b5 R15H/E20S double mutant have thermal denaturation midpoints (Tm values) of approximately 93 degrees C and approximately 104 degrees C, respectively. A 15 degrees C increase in apoprotein Tm plays a key role in the holoprotein thermal stability enhancement, and is achieved by one of the most common natural mechanisms for stabilization of thermophilic versus mesophilic proteins: raising the unfolding free energy along the entire stability curve.",

        "abstract": "The peptide backbones in folded native proteins contain distinctive secondary structures, alpha-helices, beta-sheets, and turns, with significant frequency. One question that arises in folding is how the stability of this secondary structure relates to that of the protein as a whole. To address this question, we substituted the alpha-helix-stabilizing alanine side chain at 16 selected sites in the sequence of sperm whale myoglobin, 12 at helical sites on the surface of the protein, and 4 at obviously internal sites. Substitution of alanine for bulky side chains at internal sites destabilizes the protein, as expected if packing interactions are disrupted. Alanine substitutions do not uniformly stabilize the protein, either in capping positions near the ends of helices or at mid-helical sites near the surface of myoglobin. When corrected for the extent of exposure of each side chain replaced by alanine at a mid-helix position, alanine replacement still has no clear effect in stabilizing the native structure. Thus linkage between the stabilization of secondary structure and tertiary structure in myoglobin cannot be demonstrated, probably because of the relatively small free energy differences between side chains in stabilizing isolated helix. By contrast, about 80% of the variance in free energy observed can be accounted for by the loss in buried surface area of the native residue substituted by alanine. The differential free energy of helix stabilization does not account for any additional variation.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the effect of nonenzymatic glycation (fructation) in vitro on the structure and stability of two proteins that are glycated in vivo as a consequence of high endogenous levels of sugar. We find that whereas fructation leads to the structural destabilization of the monomeric gamma-crystallin from the core of the eye lens, it leads to an increase in stability in the multimeric alpha-crystallin of the lens cortex. Thus, while glycated gamma-crystallin shows (a) a longer wavelength of fluorescent emission, indicating a greater exposure of its aromatic side chains to the medium; (b) a reduced secondary structural content; and (c) a more facile denaturation by thermodynamic and chemical means, alpha-crystallin displays the opposite behavior. Furthermore, alpha-crystallin shows an increased tendency toward multimeric aggregation upon fructation. We interpret these differences in the broad context of the effects of neutralization of positive charges on protein structure and stability. Fructation tends to destabilize gamma-crystallin, by effecting a significant reversal in the balance of charges in the protein, at physiological pH. alpha-Crystallin is a multimeric protein whose pI is lower than its pH of optimum stability. Fructation in this case effectively neutralizes the cationic charges and promotes conformational order. This study indicates that although glycation brings about similar changes in the covalent chemical structures of proteins, its influence on the three-dimensional structures of different proteins can be different.",

        "abstract": "Sac7d is a small, chromatin protein from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius which induces a sharp kink in DNA with intercalation of valine and methionine side chains. The crystal structure of the protein-DNA complex indicates that a surface tryptophan (W24) plays a key role in DNA binding by hydrogen bonding to the DNA at the kink site. We show here that substitution of the solvent-exposed tryptophan with alanine (W24A) led to a significant loss in not only DNA binding affinity but also protein stability. The W24A substitution proved to be one of the most destabilizing surface substitutions in Sac7d. A global linkage analysis of the pH and salt dependence of stability indicated that the protein stability surface (DeltaG vs temperature, pH, and salt concentration) was lowered overall by 2 kcal/mol (from 0 to 100 degrees C, pH 0 to 7, and 0 to 0.3 M KCl). The lower free energy of unfolding could not be attributed to significant structural perturbations of surface electrostatic interactions. Residual dipolar coupling of partially aligned protein and the NMR solution structure of W24A confirmed that the surface substitution resulted in no significant change in structure. Stabilization of this hyperthermophile protein and its DNA complex by a surface cluster of hydrophobic residues involving W24 and the two intercalating side chains is discussed.",

        "abstract": "The domain structure and the stability against thermal and chemical denaturation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) have been investigated by NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). At least five structurally autonomous regions of this three-domain protein have been found to exist. Two of these are the EGF-like and the kringle domains; the others are all within the third domain, which is a serine protease. The latter undergoes three unfolding transitions in its enzymatically active form. Reaction with a specific affinity label (L-Glu-L-Gly-L-Arg-chloromethyl ketone) to produce an inactivated protein results in a stabilization of the structure involved in two of these transitions, and an increase in cooperativity to give a domain which unfolds in two, not three, distinct steps. These are attributed to the denaturation of the two major subdomains of the protease structure. One of the subdomains has exceptional stability, being unfolded only under extreme conditions such as 75 degrees C at pH 2.5 or 4 M GuDCl at pH 4.5 and 29 degrees C. This region has been identified by isolation and characterization of a fragment (residues Ile-159 to Thr-277) obtained by limited proteolysis with thermolysin under conditions where the protease domain was partly unfolded. The NMR data are consistent with this stable region being at the N-terminus of the protein and indicate that its structure and stability are similar to those of the corresponding region of the native protein. These results support the idea that the u-PA protease domain has structural resemblance to the digestive serine proteases, but that stabilizing interactions within the structure can differ significantly between a group of homologous proteins.",

The wild-type and mutant enzymes were expressed in fusion with maltose binding protein in Escherichia coli and the fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. Specificity constant of most mutants was lower, but the value of Q8R-T28D double mutant enzyme was higher than that of the wild-type HFV PR. Furthermore, urea denaturation at two pH values and pH optimum values showed an increased stability and pH optimum for most mutants. These results suggest that the mutated residues may not be responsible for the higher pH optimum of HFV PR, but they may contribute to the lower dimer stability as compared with that of HIV-1 PR.",

        "abstract": "The SH3 domain from the Fyn tyrosine kinase possesses a buried hydrogen bond between the side chains of a glutamate (Glu24) and a serine (Ser41) residue. Multiple amino acid substitutions were made at these positions to determine the role of this interaction in the stability and conformational specificity of the domain and to assess the relationship between the thermodynamic stability of mutants and sequence conservation seen in the SH3 domain family. Analysis of single and double alanine mutations indicated that the Glu24-Ser41 interaction contributes 0.50 kcal/mol to the stability of the domain. However, disruption of the Glu24-Ser41 interaction did not impair peptide binding function, suggesting that the interaction is not critical for conformational specificity. The stability of the domain was not increased by the replacement of these residues with different combinations of hydrophobic residues or with potential salt bridge forming residues. Despite their similar structural roles in the Fyn SH3 domain, the Ser41 position was considerably more tolerant to substitution than was the Glu24 position. An alignment of >350 different SH3 domains has been completed in our laboratory. A statistically significant correlation was found between the conservation data for the Glu24 and Ser41 positions and the thermodynamic stabilities of the mutants constructed at these positions. Surprisingly, our analysis of sequence alignment data provided a more accurate prediction of the stability of mutants than did examination of the three-dimensional structure of the domain.",

        "abstract": "The two enzymatic components of anthrax toxin, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF), are transported to the cytosol of mammalian cells by the third component, protective antigen (PA). A heptameric form of PA binds LF and/or EF and, under the acidic conditions encountered in endosomes, generates a membrane-spanning pore that is thought to serve as a passageway for these enzymes to enter the cytosol. The pore contains a 14-stranded transmembrane beta-barrel that is too narrow to accommodate a fully folded protein, necessitating that LF and EF unfold, at least partly, in order to pass. Here, we describe the pH-dependence of the unfolding of LF(N) and EF(N), the 30kDa N-terminal PA-binding domains, and minimal translocatable units, of LF and EF. Equilibrium chemical denaturation studies using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy show that each protein unfolds via a four-state mechanism: N<-->I<-->J<-->U. The acid-induced N-->I transition occurs within the pH range of the endosome (pH 5-6). The I state predominates at lower pH values, and the J and U states are populated significantly only in the presence of denaturant. The I state is compact and has characteristics of a molten globule, as shown by its retention of significant secondary structure and its ability to bind an apolar fluorophore. The N-->I transition leads to an overall 60% increase in buried surface area exposure. The J state is expanded significantly and has diminished secondary structure content. We analyze the different protonation states of LF(N) and EF(N) in terms of a linked equilibrium proton binding model and discuss the implications of our findings for the mechanism of acidic pH-induced translocation of anthrax toxin. Finally, analysis of the structure of the transmembrane beta-barrel of PA shows that it can accommodate alpha-helix, and we suggest that the steric constraints and composition of the lumen may promote alpha-helix formation.",

The conformations of the three CL fragments were indistinguishable on the basis of circular dichroism and tryptophyl fluorescence spectra. The stability to heat and guanidine hydrochloride of CL(105-214) was almost the same as that of CL(109-214), but the stability of CL(113-214) was slightly lower than that of CL(105-214) or CL(109-214). The midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition at pH 7.5 was at 60.0 degrees C for CL(105-214), 60.4 degrees C for CL(109-214), and 57.5 degrees C for CL(113-214). The midpoint of the unfolding transition by guanidine hydrochloride at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C was 1.2 M for CL(105-214) and CL(109-214) and at 1.0 M for CL(113-214). The kinetics of unfolding and refolding by guanidine hydrochloride of these CL fragments were analyzed on the basis of the three-species mechanism, U1 in equilibrium with U2 in equilibrium with N, where U1 and U2 are the slow-folding and fast-folding species, respectively, of unfolded protein and N is native protein. It was found that only the microscopic unfolding rate constant for CL(113-214) is 2-3 times greater than that for CL(105-214) or CL(109-214) and that the other microscopic rate constants for the three CL fragments are all the same. These findings indicated that the amino-terminal residues, Gly-109-Lys-112, or a part of them, stabilize the CL(113-214) fragment by decreasing only the unfolding rate, that the transition state of the folding of the CL fragment is independent of the presence or absence of this peptide, and that, at the last step of folding, the peptide is incorporated into the globular domain, thus stabilizing it.",

        "abstract": "Much of the recent effort in protein folding has focused on the possibility that residual structures in the unfolded state may provide an initiating site for protein folding. This hypothesis is difficult to test because of the weak stability and dynamic behavior of these structures. This problem has been simplified for intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) by incorporating fluorinated aromatic amino acids during synthesis in Escherichia coli. Only the labeled residues give signals by (19)F NMR, and the 1D spectra can be assigned in both the native and unfolded states by site-directed mutagenesis. One of the two tryptophans (W82), one of the four tyrosines (Y70), and at least four of the eight phenylalanines (including F68 and F93) of IFABP are involved in a structure that is significantly populated at concentrations of urea that unfold the native structure by fluorescence and CD criteria. These residues are nonlocal in sequence and also contact each other in the native structure. Thus, a template of nativelike hydrophobic contacts in the unfolded state may serve as an initiating site for folding this beta-sheet protein.",

        "abstract": "The shutter region of serpins consists of a number of highly conserved residues that are critical for both stability and function. Several variants of antithrombin with substitutions in this region are unstable and predispose the carrier to thrombosis. Although most mutations in the shutter region investigated to date are deleterious with respect to serpin stability and function, the substitution of Phe51 by Leu in alpha(1)-antitrypsin results in enhanced stability. Here, we have investigated the effects of introducing an analogous mutation into antithrombin (Phe 77 to Leu). The mutation did not affect the kinetics of interaction with proteases. Strikingly, however, the thermostability of the protein was markedly decreased, with the serpin displaying a 13 degrees C decrease in melting temperature as compared to wild-type recombinant antithrombin. Further studies revealed that in contrast to wild-type antithrombin, the mutant adopted the latent (inactive) conformation upon mild heating. Previous studies on shutter region mutations that destabilize antithrombin revealed that such variants possess enhanced affinity for both heparin pentasaccharide and full-length heparin. The N135A/F77L mutant had unchanged affinity for heparin pentasaccharide, but the affinity for full-length heparin was increased. We suggest that the Phe77Leu mutation causes conformational changes around the top of the D-helix in antithrombin, in particular, to the arginine 132 and 133 residues that may mediate additional antithrombin/heparin interactions. This paper also demonstrates that there are major differences between the shutter regions of antithrombin and alpha(1)-antitrypsin since a stabilizing mutation in antitrypsin has the converse effect in antithrombin.",

        "abstract": "Detailed thermodynamic and spectroscopic studies were carried out on the ColE1-ROP protein in order to establish a quantitative basis for the contribution of noncovalent interactions to the stability of four-helix-bundle proteins. The energetics of both heat- and GdnHCl-induced denaturation were measured by differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) and/or by following the change in circular dichroism in the far-UV range. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses were performed to characterize the state of aggregation of the protein. No intermediate species could be detected during thermal unfolding of the dimer in the absence of GdnHCl. Under these conditions ROP unfolding exhibits a strict two-state behavior. The thermodynamic parameters for the reaction N2<->2D are delta HD = 580 +/- 20 kJ.(mol of dimer)-1, delta Cp = 10.3 +/- 1.3 kJ.(mol of dimer)-1.K-1, and Tm = 71.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The corresponding Gibbs energy change of unfolding is delta GD degree = 71.7 kJ.(mol of dimer)-1 at 25 degrees C and pH 6. In the presence of 2.5 M GdnHCl, however, ROP dissociates into monomers at elevated temperatures, as the loss of the concentration dependence of Tm and the decreased molecular weight demonstrate. The corresponding transition parameters are delta HD (2.5 M GdnHCl) = 130 +/- 10 kJ.(mol of monomer)-1 and Tm = 51.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C. Isothermal unfolding studies at 19 degrees C using GdnHCl as denaturant yielded a Gibbs energy change of unfolding of 22.4 kJ.(mol of monomer)-1. This extrapolated value is 38% lower than the corresponding delta GD degree value of 35.85 kJ.(mol of monomer)-1 calculated from thermal unfolding for the monomer in the absence of GdnHCl, where the protein is known to be a dimer. These results suggest that subunit interactions are an important source of stabilization of the native four-helix-bundle structure of ROP.",

        "abstract": "The reversible unfolding of two dissimilar proteins, phosphoglycerate kinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (PGK) and Staphylococcus aureus nuclease (SAN), was induced with two denaturants, urea and guanidinium chloride (GuHCl). For each protein, structural transitions were monitored by intrinsic fluorescence intensity changes arising from a unique tryptophan residue. In the case of SAN the single, native tryptophan residue was used, whereas for PGK two versions, one with a tryptophan at position 315 and one at 379, were constructed genetically. The resultant folding curves were analyzed by considering the change in the solvation free energy of internal amino acid residues as the denaturant concentration was varied. We derive the following simple relationship: -RT ln K = delta Gw + n delta Gs,m[D]/Kden. + [D]) where K is the equilibrium constant describing the distribution of folded and unfolded forms at a given denaturant concentration [D], delta Gw is the free energy change for the transition in the absence of denaturant, and n is the number of internal side chains becoming exposed. delta Gs,m and Kden. are constants derived empirically from the solvation energies of model compounds and represent the behavior of an average internal side chain between 0 and 6 M GuHCl and 0 and 8 M urea. For proteins of known structure these values can easily be derived, and for others, average values in guanidinium chloride (delta Gs,m = 0.775 kcal/mol and Kden. = 5.4 M) or urea (delta Gs,m = 1.198 kcal/mol and Kden. = 25.25 M) can be used in the analysis. Results show that the parameters n and delta Gw are independent of the denaturant used for all 12 transitions studied. This supports the hypothesis that the unfolding activity of urea and GuHCl can be accounted for by their effect on the solvation energy of amino acid side chains which are buried in the folded but exposed in the unfolded protein. This simple analytical treatment allows the \"cooperativity\" of protein folding to be interpreted in terms of the number of side chains becoming exposed to the solvent in a given step and allows accurate estimation of the free energy irrespective of the denaturant concentration needed to induce the transition.",

        "title": "Domain behavior during the folding of a thermostable phosphoglycerate kinase.", 
        "abstract": "Bacillus stearothermophilus phosphoglycerate kinase (bsPGK) is a monomeric enzyme of 394 residues comprising two globular domains (N and C), covalently linked by an interdomain alpha-helix (residues 170-185). The molecule folds to the native state in three stages. In the first, each domain rapidly and independently collapses to form an intermediate in which the N-domain is stabilized by 5.1 kcal mol-1 and the C-domain by 3.3 kcal mol-1 over their respective unfolded conformations. The N-domain then converts to a folded state at a rate of 1.2 s-1 (delta GI-F = 3.8 kcal mol-1), followed by the C-domain at 0.032 s-1 (delta GI-F = 12.1 kcal mol-1). It is this last step that limits the rate of acquisition of enzyme activity. In the dynamics of unfolding in water, the N-domain converts to the intermediate state at a rate of 8 x 10(-4) s-1, some 10(7) times faster than the C-domain. Consequently, the most populated intermediate in the folding reaction has a native-like N-domain, while that in the unfolding direction has a native-like C-domain. In a conventional sense, therefore, the folding/unfolding kinetics of bsPGK can be described as random order. Consistent with these observations, cutting the molecule in the interdomain helix produces two, independently stable units comprising residues 1-175 and 180-394. A detailed comparison of their folding behavior with that of the whole molecule reveals that true interdomain contacts are relatively weak, contributing approximately 1.4 kcal mol-1 to the stability of the active enzyme. The only interactions which contribute to the stability of rapidly formed intermediates or to transition states along the productive folding pathways are those within domain cores. Contacts formed either between domains or with the interdomain helix are made only in the folded ground state, but do not constitute a separate step in the folding mechanism. Intriguingly, the most pronounced effect of interdomain contacts on the kinetics of folding is inhibitory; the presence of the C-domain appearing to reduce the effective rate of acquisition of native structure within the N-domain.",

The five residues, distributed in three spatially separated regions, were selected and mutated with reference to the corresponding residues in HT c(552) through careful structure comparison. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the stability of the quintuple mutant of PA c(551) could be partly attained through an enthalpic factor. The solution structure of the mutant showed that, as in HT c(552), there were tighter side chain packings in the mutated regions. Furthermore, the mutant had an increased total accessible surface area, resulting in great negative hydration free energy. Our results provide a novel example of protein stabilization in that limited amino acid substitutions can confer the overall stability of a natural highly thermophilic protein upon a mesophilic molecule.",

        "abstract": "The unique nature of the proline side-chain imposes severe constraints on the polypeptide backbone, and thus it seems likely that it plays a special structural or functional role in the architecture of proteins. We have investigated the role of proline residues in suc1, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cks) family of proteins, whose known function is to bind to and regulate the activity of the major mitotic cdk. The effect on stability of mutation to alanine of all but two of the eight proline residues is correlated with their conservation within the family. The remaining two proline residues are located in the hinge loop between two beta-strands that mediates a domain-swapping process involving exchange of a beta-strand between two monomers to form a dimer pair. Mutation of these proline residues to alanine stabilises the protein. cdk binding is unaffected by these mutations, but dimerisation is altered. We propose, therefore, that the double-proline motif is conserved for the purpose of domain swapping, which suggests that this phenomenon plays a role in the function of cks proteins. Thus, the conservation of the proline residues is a good indicator of their roles in suc1, either in the stabilisation of the native state or in performing functions that are as yet unknown. In addition, the strain resulting from two of the proline residues was relieved successfully by mutation of the preceeding residue to glycine, suggesting a general method for designing more stable proteins.",

We have now extended the range and reliability of the procedure by using the COSMIC (Combination of Sequential Mutant Interaction Cycles) technique, in which a series of double-mutant cycles is constructed. In each cycle, the side-chains of two amino acid residues that interact in the folded state are mutated separately and together. Kinetic and equilibrium measurements on folding for each cycle show unambiguously whether or not two residues interact during protein folding. A series of such cycles has been constructed to leapfrog along the major alpha-helix of barnase, comprising residues 6 to 18. The helix is found to be intact from its C terminus to residue 12 but begins to unwind towards the N terminus in both the transition state for unfolding and in a folding intermediate.",

Each chimera combines the folding core from one parent protein and the remaining parts of the other. Both chimeras form active, well-folded RNases H. Stability curves, based on CD-monitored chemical denaturations, show that the chimera with the thermophilic core is more stable, has a higher midpoint of thermal denaturation, and a lower change in heat capacity (DeltaCp) upon unfolding than the chimera with the mesophilic core. A possible explanation for the low DeltaCp of both the parent thermophilic RNase H and the chimera with the thermophilic core is the residual structure in the denatured state. On the basis of the studied parameters, the chimera with the thermophilic core resembles a true thermophilic protein.

In the present study, one of six mutant proteins was suitable for evaluating the strength of the hydrogen bond. Delta Gwild/HB for the intramolecular hydrogen bond at Tyr124 was evaluated to be 7.5 kJ/mol.

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding of monomeric and delipidated Ca(2+)-ATPase, solubilized in C12E8, can be appropriately described as a non-two-state irreversible denaturation, with only one endothermic peak. In the Ca2+ concentration range (0-0.5 mM) which stimulates the ATPase activity of solubilized monomeric ATPase, Ca2+ shifts the critical temperature midpoint of the denaturation process (Tm) from 42 to 50 degrees C without segregation of the endothermic peak into two separate components. Because 20 mM Mg2+ only shifts the Tm from 42 to 44 degrees C, we conclude that the effect of Ca2+ upon the Tm is likely to be due to binding to the high affinity Ca2+ sites in the ATPase. The effect of Ca2+ upon the enthalpy of denaturation is biphasic, suggesting the presence of low affinity Ca2+ sites (K0.5 in the millimolar range) in monomeric and solubilized ATPase.",

We explore the thermodynamic significance of such binding using differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and hydrogen-tritium exchange measurements to study the effect of these agents on myoglobin folding stability. Though specific binding of these anesthetics might be expected to stabilize myoglobin against unfolding, dichloromethane actually destabilized myoglobin at all examined concentrations of this anesthetic (15, 40, and 200 mM). On the other hand, xenon (1 atm) stabilized myoglobin. Thus, dichloromethane and xenon have opposite effects on myoglobin stability despite localization in comparably folded X-ray crystallographic structures.

        "abstract": "Evolutionary conservation of substructure architecture between yeast iso-1-cytochrome c and the well-characterized horse cytochrome c is studied with limited proteolysis, the alkaline conformational transition and global unfolding with guanidine-HCl. Mass spectral analysis of limited proteolysis cleavage products for iso-1-cytochrome c show that its least stable substructure is the same as horse cytochrome c. The limited proteolysis data yield a free energy of 3.8 +/- 0.4 kcal mol(-1) to unfold the least stable substructure compared with 5.05 +/- 0.30 kcal mol(-1) for global unfolding of iso-1-cytochrome c. Thus, substructure stabilities of iso-1-cytochrome c span only approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-1) compared with approximately 8 kcal mol(-1) for horse cytochrome c. Consistent with the less cooperative folding thus expected for the horse protein, the guanidine-HCl m-values are approximately 3 kcal mol(-1)M(-1) versus approximately 4.5 kcal mol(-1)M(-1) for horse versus yeast cytochrome c. The tight free energy spacing of the yeast cytochrome c substructures suggests that its folding has more branch points than for horse cytochrome c. Studies on a variant of iso-1-cytochrome c with an H26N mutation indicate that the least and most stable substructures unfold sequentially and the two least stable substructures unfold independently as for horse cytochrome c. Thus, important aspects of the substructure architecture of horse cytochrome c, albeit compressed energetically, are preserved evolutionally in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c.",

The distribution of encoded amino acids at all five positions is approximately as expected theoretically and indicates that no major bias was introduced towards particular residues.

Mutant rnhA genes encoding proteins with ribonuclease H activities were screened by their ability to suppress the ribonuclease-H-dependent, temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of E. coli strain MIC3001. Based on the DNA sequences, nine mutant proteins were predicted to have ribonuclease H activity in vivo. All of these mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity and examined for enzymic activity and protein stability. Among them, only the mutant proteins [D134H]RNase H and [D134N]RNase H were shown to have considerable ribonuclease H activities. Determination of the kinetic parameters revealed that replacement of Asp134 by amino acid residues other than asparagine and histidine dramatically decreased the enzymic activity without seriously affecting the substrate binding. Determination of the CD spectra indicated that none of the mutations seriously affected secondary and tertiary structure. The protein stability was determined from the thermal denaturation curves. All mutant proteins were more stable than the wild-type protein. Such stabilization effects would be a result of a reduction in the negative charge repulsion between Asp134 and the active-site residues, and/or an enhancement of the stability of the alpha V helix. These results strongly suggest that Asp134 does not contribute to the maintenance of the molecular architecture but the carboxyl oxygen at its delta 1 position impacts catalysis.",

        "abstract": "A specific tertiary hydrogen bond that is present between the side-chain hydroxyl group of Tyr30 and the side-chain N delta 1 atom of His17 in the small, monomeric, single-domain protein, barstar, has been perturbed by site-directed mutagenesis of the sole histidine residue (His17) to a glutamine residue. The effect of the perturbation has been studied in the resultant mutant protein, H17Q, by equilibrium unfolding methods. Both guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced denaturation and thermal denaturation studies have been performed, with unfolding monitored by UV absorption, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, near-UV and far-UV circular dichroism (CD), and size exclusion chromatography. While wild-type (wt) barstar shows a two-state unfolding transition when denatured by either GdnHCl or heat, the mutant protein H17Q undergoes unfolding through a transition that involves at least one equilibrium intermediate I, which is populated at intermediate concentrations of denaturant or at intermediate temperatures. In the case of GdnHCl-induced denaturation, the midpoint of the fluorescence-monitored denaturation curve is 1.4 +/- 0.1 M, that of the near-UV CD-monitored denaturation curve is 1.6 +/- 0.1 M, and that of the far-UV CD-monitored denaturation curve is 1.8 +/- 0.1 M. The accumulation of I is also evident in gel filtration experiments which indicate that I forms slowly from the fully-folded form, F, and that once formed, I rapidly equilibrates with the unfolded form, U. The gel filtration data for H17Q suggest that in 1.5 M GdnHCl, there is no F present and that I is the predominant form. I does not appear to possess hydrated hydrophobic surfaces, which is reflected in its inability to bind 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS). At least one equilibrium-unfolding intermediate is also observed upon thermal denaturation. The midpoints of the thermal denaturation curves of H17Q are 63.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C when monitored by absorbance at 287 nm or by intrinsic fluorescence at 332 nm; 65.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C when monitored by mean residue ellipticity at 275 nm; and 68.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C when monitored by mean residue ellipticity at 220 nm. In contrast, all four optical probes yield the same midpoint, 71.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C, for the wt protein. The results indicate that perturbation of the tertiary hydrogen bond leads to the accumulation of at least one intermediate (I) in both thermal denaturation studies and GdnHCl-induced denaturation studies. The intermediate(s) I are characterized by a greater disruption of tertiary structure than of secondary structure.",

Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace Pro 93 or Pro 114 with a glycine residue, and the crystalline structure of the P93G variant was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis to a resolution of 1.7 A. This structure is essentially identical to that of the wild-type protein, except for the 91-94 beta-turn containing the substitution. In the wild-type protein, the beta-turn is of type VIa. In the P93G variant, this turn is of type II with the peptide bond preceding Gly 93 being trans. The thermal stabilities of the P93G and P114G variants were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry and thermal denaturation experiments monitored by ultraviolet spectroscopy. The value of delta deltaGm which reports on the stability lost in the variants, is 1.5-fold greater for the P114G variant than for the P93G variant. The greater stability of the P93G variant is likely due to the relatively facile accommodation of residues 91-94 in a type II turn, which has a preference for a glycine residue in its i + 2 position.",

The activity and spectroscopic properties of the mutant enzyme did not differ significantly from those of the wild type, indicating that the mutation has only a very limited effect on the structure of the protein. The stability of the folded protein is reduced, however, by 5-10 kJ mol-1 relative to that of the molten globule intermediate (H), but the values of the folding rate constants are unchanged, suggesting that Trp-290 becomes organized in its nativelike environment only after the rate-limiting step; i.e., the C-terminal region of the enzyme folds very late. In contrast to the significant increase in fluorescence intensity seen in the dead time (3-4 ms) of refolding of the wild-type protein, no corresponding burst phase was observed with the mutant enzyme, enabling the burst phase to be attributed specifically to the C-terminal Trp-290. This residue is suggested to be buried in a nonpolar environment from which it has to escape during subsequent folding steps. With both proteins, fast early collapse leads to a folding intermediate in which the C-terminal region of the polypeptide chain is trapped in a non-native structure, consistent with a nonhierarchical folding process.",

However, recent time-resolved infrared (IR) temperature-jump experiments indicate that the folding trajectory of CspA may be more complicated. The sole tryptophan of wild-type CspA (Trp11), which is used to monitor the folding process by fluorescence spectroscopy, is located in an unusual aromatic cluster on the surface of CspA within the nucleic acid binding site. To gain a more global picture of the folding kinetics of CspA and to determine if there are any previously undetected intermediates, we have introduced a second tryptophan at three different surface locations in the protein. The three mutations did not significantly alter the tertiary structure of CspA, although two of the substitutions were found to be slightly stabilizing. Two-state folding, as detected by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy, is preserved in all three mutants. These results indicate that the fast folding of CspA is driven by a concerted mechanism.",

        "abstract": "It is known that the peptide corresponding to the N-terminal beta-hairpin of ubiquitin, U(1-17), can populate the monomeric beta-hairpin conformation in aqueous solution. In this study, we show that the Gly-10 that forms the bulge of the beta-turn in this hairpin is very important to the stability of the hairpin. The deletion of this residue to desG10(1-16) unfolds the structure of the peptide in water. Even under denaturing conditions, this bulge appears to be important in maintaining the residual structure of ubiquitin, which involves tertiary interactions within the sequence 1 to 34 in the denatured state. We surmise that this residual structure functions as one of the nucleation centers in the folding process and is important in stabilizing the transition state. In accordance with this idea, deleting Gly-10 slows down the refolding and unfolding rate by about one half.",

        "abstract": "The hydrogen isotope exchange kinetics of buried NH protons in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) was measured in 8 M urea at 30 degrees C and pH 3.5. The data were analyzed by the two-process model in which slower exchanging protons utilize an unfolding mechanism and more rapidly exchanging protons exchange from the folded state. Urea accelerates the set of protons exchanging by the unfolding mechanism, all of which have approximately the same exchange rate constants in urea. For protons in this set, the ratio of exchange rate constants in the presence and absence of urea is used to estimate delta delta G(0-->8M urea) = 6.6 kcal/mol. For the set of protons exchanging from the folded state, 8 M urea either has no effect or slows exchange. Slowing of exchange by urea implies binding of urea to sites at or near the exchanging proton. Some buried protons exchanging from the folded state have diminished rates in 8 M urea, meaning that urea is accessible to these buried sites. Several unassigned side-chain NH's of arginine or lysine are highly protected from exchange by urea, suggesting that they are the location of urea binding sites on the surface of the molecule.",

Unnatural amino acid packing mutants of Escherichia coli thioredoxin produced by combined mutagenesis/chemical modification techniques. Protein Sci 2:395-403). The side chains added to the cysteine included methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, and cyclo-pentyl derivatives. The side chains appear to exploit the presence of the large cavities to incorporate these variant forms, enabling the protein to fold and have some activity. Solution structural and kinetic data suggested that these substitutions had little effect on the overall fold of the protein. Thermodynamic data revealed that the entropic effect of restricting the side chains in the folded protein has an effect on the stability. The variant forms of thioredoxin have different propensities to form dimers despite the limited structural perturbations. Molecular modeling studies allow the conformation of the side chains to be assessed.",

        "abstract": "A recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin variant which increased thermal stability was obtained from random mutagenesis followed by screening. The clone was identified as having a single mutation of Phe51-->Cys. Heat deactivation of purified recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin produced in Escherichia coli revealed that the mutation slowed down the deactivation rate 10-fold at 57 degrees C, increasing thermal stability of recombinant protein to almost that of natural glycosylated plasma form. The mutant protein also exhibited increased stability against denaturant. The urea-induced unfolding monitored by the changes in fluorescence intensity at 360 nm showed that the mutation shifted midpoint of the transition from 1.9 M to 2.8 M. The mutation site is particularly interesting in that some genetic variants mapped at adjacent positions were shown previously to cause aggregation of the polypeptides, while the Phe51-->Cys mutation decreased aggregation rate significantly during heat deactivation. The association rate constant with porcine pancreatic elastase revealed that the mutation did not affect inhibitory activity significantly. The site identified may be critical for regulating stability of alpha 1-antitrypsin. Characterization of various single amino acid substitutions at position 51 suggests that volume and flexibility of hydrophobic side chain at the site are critical factors for enhancing the stability of alpha 1-antitrypsin.",

The structure of this intermediate is similar to that of E.coli RNase H and corresponds remarkably well to a partially folded form that is populated at low levels in the native state of the protein. Proline isomerization appears to partly limit the folding of the thermophilic but not the mesophilic protein.

        "abstract": "Bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) is a widely studied protein belonging to the lipocalin family, whose structural characterisation has been reported by X-ray crystallography and NMR studies at physiological and acidic pH, respectively. Bovine beta-LG consists of nine antiparallel beta-sheets and a terminal alpha-helix segment. The beta-sheets form a calyx structure with a hydrophobic buried cluster conferring stability to the protein while a hydrophobic surface patch provides stabilising interactions between the barrel and the flanking terminal helix. Here, the stability and the folding properties of bovine beta-LG in the presence of a chemical denaturant is probed. The analysis of the NMR spectra recorded in aqueous solution with increasing amounts of urea revealed that the intensities of the backbone cross-peaks decrease upon increasing urea concentration, while their secondary shifts do not change significantly on going from 0 to 5 M urea, thus suggesting the presence of slow exchange between native and unfolded protein. Hydrogen exchange measurements at different urea concentrations were performed in order to evaluate the exchange rates of individual backbone amide protons. The opening reactions that determine protein exchange can be computed for the most slowly exchanging hydrogen atoms, and the measured exchange rates and the corresponding free energies can be expressed in terms of the equilibrium energetic for the global transition and the local fluctuations. Most of the residues converge to define a common isotherm identifying a unique cooperative folding unit, encompassing all the strands, except strand betaI, and the terminal region of the helix. The amides that do not join the same global unfolding isotherm are characterised by low DeltaGH20op and especially by low m values, indicating that they are already substantially exposed in the native state. A two-state unfolding model N <==> U is therefore proposed for this rather big protein, in agreement with CD data. Renaturation studies show that the unfolding mechanism is reversible up to 6 M urea and suggest a similar unfolding and refolding pathway. Present results are discussed in light of the hypothesis of an alpha-->beta transition proposed for bovine beta-LG refolding.",

        "abstract": "In an attempt to simplify the protein folding problem, and also to further investigate the role of alanine as a helix-stabilizing residue, a series of alanines was introduced within the alpha-helix that includes residues 126-134 of T4 lysozyme. In wild-type lysozyme this alpha-helix contains alanine residues at positions 129, 130, and 134. Mutant lysozymes with alanines substituted at positions 128, 131, 132, and 133, either as single substitutions or in selected combinations, were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. With the exception of the replacement of Leu 133, which is buried within the hydrophobic core of the protein, all the variants were more stable than wild-type lysozyme. The variant with alanines substituted at positions 128, 131, and 132 (E128A/V131A/N132A), which incorporates the sequence Ala 128-Ala 129-Ala 130-Ala 131-Ala 132-Leu 133-Ala 134, has a melting temperature 3.3 degrees C above that of wild-type lysozyme. Determination of the crystal structure of this mutant lysozyme shows that the replacement of Glu 128, Val 131, and Asn 132 with alanine causes alpha-helix 126-134 to rotate 3.4 degrees about an axis parallel to its own axis. This rotation seems to be triggered primarily by the loss of a hydrogen bond between Asn 132 and Ser 117 and is associated with the repacking of several side chains at the interface between alpha-helix 126-134 and the adjacent alpha-helix 115-122.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The thermal and chemical equilibrium unfolding of a 32-residue alpha-helical peptide comprising its dimerization domain (B1-Dim) was monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The conformational stability of this peptide is shown to be concentration dependent, and the unfolding reaction is described as a two-state transition between folded dimers and unfolded monomers. The thermodynamic parameters associated with the unfolding reaction were determined under the two-state assumption by the van't Hoff procedure. The enthalpy of unfolding increases linearly with temperature, and the corresponding value of delta Cp, the difference in heat capacity between the unfolded and the folded forms of the peptide, is estimated to be ca. 0.7 kcal mol-1 K-1. The dimeric folded structure of the peptide is stabilized, at 25 degrees C, by a delta G of about 11.5 kcal mol-1, which is equivalent to a dimerization constant greater than 10(8) mol-1.

The transition is broad and cannot be treated as a single transition that mimics a two-state process, suggesting the existence of domains. Deconvolution is done to fit it into two quasi-independent two-state transitions. For F-actin, the transition is more cooperative, with a cooperative ratio (the ratio of van't Hoff enthalpy and calorimetric enthalpy) of 1.4, indicating intermonomer interaction. The delta H of the thermal unfolding of F-actin is 162 +/- 10 kcal/mol with a Tm at 67.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C. A state of G-actin similar to that of the heat-denatured form, designated D-actin, is obtained by removing tightly bound Ca2+ with EGTA. The DSC-detectable cooperative transition is completely lost when the free calcium concentration of the medium is 1 x 10(-11) M or lower, using a Ca2+/EGTA buffer system. However, circular dichroism (CD) shows that the helix content of actin, 32% in the G-form, is only partially reduced to 19% in this apo form. The CD spectrum and the helix content of the calcium-depleted actin are almost identical with those of the heat-denatured D form. This loss of 40% of the native helical content is irreversible in both cases. The remaining 60% of the native helical content cannot be further eliminated by heating to 95 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

With an analysis in which some factors that affected the stability due to mutation were considered, the contribution of hydrogen bonds to the stability (Delta DeltaGHB) was extracted on the basis of the structures of the mutant proteins. The results showed that hydrogen bonds between protein atoms and between a protein atom and a water bound with the protein molecule favorably contribute to the protein stability. The net contribution of one intramolecular hydrogen bond to protein stability (DeltaGHB) was 8.9 +/- 2.6 kJ/mol on average.

High resolution DSC shows that LDL undergoes three thermal transitions. The first is reversible and corresponds to the order-disorder transition of the core-located cholesteryl esters (CE) (Tm = 31.1 degrees C, delta H = 0.75 cal/g CE). The second, previously unreported, is reversible with heating up to 65 degrees C (Tm = 57.1 degrees C, delta H = 0.20 cal/g apoB) and coincides with a reversible change in the tertiary structure of apoB as shown by near UV-CD. No alteration in the secondary structure of apoB is observed over this temperature range. The third transition is irreversible (Tm = 73.5 degrees C, delta H = 0.99 cal/g apoB) and coincides with disruption of the LDL particle and denaturation of apoB. The ratio of delta H/delta HvH for the reversible protein-related transition suggests that this is a two-state event that correlates with a change in the overall tertiary structure of the entire apoB molecule. The second protein-related transition is complex and coincides with irreversible denaturation. ApoB solubilized in NaDC undergoes three thermal transitions. The first two are reversible (Tm = 49.7 degrees C, delta H = 1.13 cal/g apoB; Tm = 56.4 degrees C, delta H = 2.55 cal/g apoB, respectively) and coincide with alterations in both secondary and tertiary structure of apoB. The changes in secondary structure reflect an increase in random coil conformation with a concomitant decrease in beta-structure, while the change in tertiary structure suggests that the conformation of the disulfide bonds is altered. The third transition is irreversible (Tm = 66.6 degrees C, delta H = 0.54 cal/g apoB) and coincides with complete denaturation of apoB and disruption of the NaDC micelle. The ratio of delta H/delta HvH for the two reversible transitions indicates that each of these transitions is complex which may suggest that several regions or domains of apoB are involved in each thermal event.",

All mutations with non-marginal effects on stability clustered in a limited, surface-exposed region of the enzyme, indicating that this region is involved in a partial unfolding process that triggers irreversible thermal inactivation (aggregation). A double mutant containing two stabilizing mutations in this region (G188A, A234P) displayed a 10-fold increase in half-life at 57 degrees C and a 4.2 degrees C increase in apparent T(m).

Removal of Ca2+ from the protein enhances its sensitivity to pH and ionic conditions due to noncompensated negative charge-charge interactions at the cation binding site, which significantly reduces its overall stability. At neutral pH and low ionic strength, the native structure of apo-alpha-lactalbumin is stable below 14 C and undergoes a conformational change to a native-like molten globule intermediate at temperatures above 25 degrees C. The denaturation of either holo- or apo-alpha-lactalbumin is a highly cooperative process that is characterized by an enthalpy of similar magnitude when calculated at the same temperature. Measured by direct calorimetric titration, the enthalpy of Ca2+-binding to apo-LA at pH 7.5 is -7.1 kJ mol(-1) at 5.0 degrees C. which is essentially invariant to protonation effects. This small enthalpy effect infers that stabilization of alpha-lactalbumin by Ca2+ is primarily an entropy driven process, presumably arising from electrostatic interactions and the hydration effect. In contrast to the binding of calcium, the interaction of sodium with apo-LA does not produce a noticeable heat effect and is characterized by its ionic nature rather than specific binding to the metal-binding site. Characterization of the conformational stability and ligand binding energetics of alpha-lactalbumin as a function of solvent conditions furnishes significant insight regarding the molecular flexibility and regulatory mechanism mediated by this protein.",

We have investigated the role of two conserved hydrophobic residues of Cry4B in structural stabilization. Substitutions of the leucine-175 and isoleucine-189 on helix alpha5 with valine and leucine did not affect the expression level, solubility and proteolytic processing. Steady state analysis of an unfolding experiment as monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated a typical two-state transition. The determined unfolding free energy for the L175V mutant revealed a structural destabilization of 10.49 kcal/mol relative to the wild type. However unfolding kinetic analysis gave identical activation energy for wild type and both mutants. Our findings suggested that a perturbation on the close packing of the hydrophobic side chains in protein interior could lead to a significant destabilization of the native conformation.",

        "abstract": "The most common form of systemic amyloidosis originates from antibody light chains. The large number of amino acid variations that distinguish amyloidogenic from nonamyloidogenic light chain proteins has impeded our understanding of the structural basis of light-chain fibril formation. Moreover, even among the subset of human light chains that are amyloidogenic, many primary structure differences are found. We compared the thermodynamic stabilities of two recombinant kappa4 light-chain variable domains (V(L)s) derived from amyloidogenic light chains with a V(L) from a benign light chain. The amyloidogenic V(L)s were significantly less stable than the benign V(L). Furthermore, only the amyloidogenic V(L)s formed fibrils under native conditions in an in vitro fibril formation assay. We used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the consequences of individual amino acid substitutions found in the amyloidogenic V(L)s on stability and fibril formation capability. Both stabilizing and destabilizing mutations were found; however, only destabilizing mutations induced fibril formation in vitro. We found that fibril formation by the benign V(L) could be induced by low concentrations of a denaturant. This indicates that there are no structural or sequence-specific features of the benign V(L) that are incompatible with fibril formation, other than its greater stability. These studies demonstrate that the V(L) beta-domain structure is vulnerable to destabilizing mutations at a number of sites, including complementarity determining regions (CDRs), and that loss of variable domain stability is a major driving force in fibril formation.",

        "abstract": "Previously, we calculated a consensus amino acid sequence from 13 homologous fungal phytases. A synthetic gene was constructed and recombinantly expressed. Surprisingly, consensus phytase-1 was 15-26 degrees C more thermostable than all parent phytases used in its design [Lehmann et al. (2000)Protein Eng., 13, 49-57]. In the present study, inclusion of six further phytase sequences in the amino acid sequence alignment resulted in the replacement of 38 amino acid residues in either one or both of the new consensus phytases-10 and -11. Since consensus phytase-10, again, was 7.4 degrees C more thermostable than consensus phytase-1, the thermostability effects of most of the 38 amino acid substitutions were tested by site-directed mutagenesis. Both stabilizing and destabilizing mutations were identified, but all affected the stability of the enzyme by <3 degrees C. The combination of all stabilizing amino acid exchanges in a multiple mutant of consensus phytase-1 increased the unfolding temperature from 78.0 to 88.5 degrees C. Likewise, back-mutation of four destabilizing amino acids and introduction of an additional stabilizing amino acid in consensus phytase-10 further increased the unfolding temperature from 85.4 to 90.4 degrees C. The thermostabilization achieved is the result of a combination of slight improvements from multiple amino acid exchanges rather than being the effect of a single or of just a few dominating mutations that have been introduced by chance. The present findings support the general validity of the consensus concept for thermostability engineering of proteins.",

        "abstract": "p18(INK4c) is a member of the INK4 family of proteins that regulate the G(1) to S cell cycle transition by binding to and inhibiting the pRb kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. The p16(INK4a) member of the INK4 protein family is altered in a variety of cancers and structure-function studies of the INK4 proteins reveal that the vast majority of missense tumor-derived p16(INK4a) mutations reduce protein thermodynamic stability. Based on this observation, we used p18(INK4c) as a model to test the proposal that INK4 proteins with increased stability might have enhanced cell cycle inhibitory activity. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to prepare p18(INK4c) mutant proteins with a predicted increase in stability. Using this approach, we report the generation of three mutant p18(INK4C) proteins, F71N, F82Q, and F92N, with increased stability toward thermal denaturation of which the F71N mutant also showed an increased stability to chemical denaturation. The x-ray crystal structures of the F71N, F82Q, and F92N p18INK4C mutant proteins were determined to reveal the structural basis for their increased stability properties. Significantly, the F71N mutant also showed enhanced CDK6 interaction and cell cycle inhibitory activity in vivo, as measured using co-immunoprecipitation and transient transfection assays, respectively. These studies show that a structure-based approach to increase the thermodynamic stability of INK4 proteins can be exploited to prepare more biologically active molecules with potential applications for the development of molecules to treat p16(INK4a)-mediated cancers.",

        "abstract": "Comparative studies of the importance of the two histidines of rat cytochrome c that are not ligands of the heme iron, for the stability of the protein, were carried out by site-directed mutagenesis. Histidine 26 was substituted by valine and the resulting effects on the stability of the Met-80-sulfur to heme iron bond to changes in pH and temperature, and of the global stability of the protein to unfolding in urea solutions, were measured. It is suggested that the loss of the hydrogen bond between the His-26 imidazole and the backbone amide of Asn-31 caused the observed decreases in local stability; and that, in addition, the elimination of the hydrogen bond between this imidazole and the carbonyl of Pro-44 resulted in an increase of the mobility of the lower loop (residues 41-47) on the right side of the protein and of its distance from the middle loop (residues 26-31), probably leading to greater hydration of the interior right side of the molecule. These changes resulted in a decrease in the global stability of the protein. Further mutation of Asn-52 to Ile led to a total recovery of the wild-type stability of the sulfur-iron bond, and a partial restoration of the global stability of the protein. Substitution of Phe for His-33 did not alter the sulfur-iron bond but caused a pronounced increase in the global stability of the protein. It is suggested that this effect results from hydrophobic interaction of the Phe-33 side chain with the lower loop on the right side of the protein. Such an interaction also explains the observation that the same mutation reversed the loss of global stability caused by substitution of Val to His-26, but did not restore the strength of the sulfur-iron bond that this mutation had brought about.",

        "abstract": "The size of the cavity around Ser68 of Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI was modulated by amino acid substitutions to examine the effects on the stability of the enzyme. Five mutant proteins, Ser68----Gly, Ser68----Ala, Ser68----Thr, Ser68----Val and Ser68----Leu, were constructed. Each of the mutant proteins exhibited at least 40% of the enzyme activity of the wild-type protein. The stabilities of the mutant proteins were determined from urea-denaturation and thermal-denaturation curves. Among the five mutations, only the Ser----Val mutation resulted in an increase in the stability of the enzyme. The melting temperature, tm, at pH 3.0 of the mutant protein Ser68----Val was increased by 1.9 degrees C. Its free-energy change of unfolding in the absence of urea, delta G(H2O), and the midpoint of the denaturation curve, [D]1/2, were also increased by 5.4 kJ/mol and 0.18 M, respectively. The increase in the stability of the enzyme is probably due to the filling of the cavity space around Ser68 by valine. However, the mutation of Ser68 to glycine or leucine residues resulted in a considerable decrease in stability. In these cases, some conformational changes occur, as suggested by the CD and 1H-NMR spectra of these mutant proteins.",

        "abstract": "Family II inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPases) have been recently found in a variety of bacteria. Their primary and tertiary structures differ from those of the well-known family I PPases, although both have a binuclear metal center directly involved in catalysis. Here, we examined the effects of mutating one Glu, four His, and five Asp residues forming or close to the metal center on Mn(2+) binding affinity, catalysis, oligomeric structure, and thermostability of the family II PPase from Bacillus subtilis (bsPPase). Mutations H9Q, D13E, D15E, and D75E in two metal-binding subsites caused profound (10(4)- to 10(6)-fold) reductions in the binding affinity for Mn(2+). Most of the mutations decreased k(cat) for MgPP(i) by 2-3 orders of magnitude when measured with Mn(2+) or Mg(2+) bound to the high-affinity subsite and Mg(2+) bound to both the low-affinity subsite and pyrophosphate. In the E78D variant, the k(cat) for the Mn-bound enzyme was decreased 120-fold, converting bsPPase from an Mn-specific to an Mg-specific enzyme. K(m) values were less affected by the mutations, and, interestingly, were decreased in most cases. Mutations of His(97) and His(98) residues, which lie near the subunit interface, greatly destabilized the bsPPase dimer, whereas most other mutations stabilized it. Mn(2+), in sharp contrast to Mg(2+), conferred high thermostability to wild-type bsPPase, although this effect was reduced by all of the mutations except D203E. These results indicate that family II PPases have a more integrated active site structure than family I PPases and are consequently more sensitive to conservative mutations.",

        "abstract": "Attempts to increase protein stability by insertion of novel disulfide bonds have not always been successful. According to the two current models, cross-links enhance stability mainly through denatured state effects. We have investigated the effects of removal and addition of disulfide cross-links, protein flexibility in the vicinity of a cross-link, and disulfide loop size on the stability of Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor-V (CMTI-V; 7 kD) by differential scanning calorimetry. CMTI-V offers the advantage of a large, flexible, and solvent-exposed loop not involved in extensive intra-molecular interactions. We have uncovered a negative correlation between retention time in hydrophobic column chromatography, a measure of protein hydrophobicity, and melting temperature (T(m)), an indicator of native state stabilization, for CMTI-V and its variants. In conjunction with the complete set of thermodynamic parameters of denaturation, this has led to the following deductions: (1) In the less stable, disulfide-removed C3S/C48S (Delta Delta G(d)(50 degrees C) = -4 kcal/mole; Delta T(m) = -22 degrees C), the native state is destabilized more than the denatured state; this also applies to the less-stable CMTI-V* (Delta Delta G(d)(50 degrees C) = -3 kcal/mole; Delta T(m) = -11 degrees C), in which the disulfide-containing loop is opened by specific hydrolysis of the Lys(44)-Asp(45) peptide bond; (2) In the less stable, disulfide-inserted E38C/W54C (Delta Delta G(d)(50 degrees C) = -1 kcal/mole; Delta T(m) = +2 degrees C), the denatured state is more stabilized than the native state; and (3) In the more stable, disulfide-engineered V42C/R52C (Delta Delta G(d)(50 degrees C) = +1 kcal/mole; Delta T(m) = +17 degrees C), the native state is more stabilized than the denatured state. These results show that a cross-link stabilizes both native and denatured states, and differential stabilization of the two states causes either loss or gain in protein stability. Removal of hydrogen bonds in the same flexible region of CMTI-V resulted in less destabilization despite larger changes in the enthalpy and entropy of denaturation. The effect of a cross-link on the denatured state of CMTI-V was estimated directly by means of a four-state thermodynamic cycle consisting of native and denatured states of CMTI-V and CMTI-V*. Overall, the results show that an enthalpy-entropy compensation accompanies disulfide bond effects and protein stabilization is profoundly modulated by altered hydrophobicity of both native and denatured states, altered flexibility near the cross-link, and residual structure in the denatured state.",

        "abstract": "The effects of chain cleavage and circular permutation on the structure, stability, and activity of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherichia coli were investigated by various spectroscopic and biochemical methods. Cleavage of the backbone after position 86 resulted in two fragments, (1--86) and (87--159) each of which are poorly structured and enzymatically inactive. When combined in a 1 : 1 molar ratio, however, the fragments formed a high-affinity (K(a) = 2.6 x 10(7) M(-1)) complex that displays a weakly cooperative urea-induced unfolding transition at micromolar concentrations. The retention of about 15% of the enzymatic activity of full-length DHFR is surprising, considering that the secondary structure in the complex is substantially reduced from its wild-type counterpart. In contrast, a circularly permuted form with its N-terminus at position 86 has similar overall stability to full-length DHFR, about 50% of its activity, substantial secondary structure, altered side-chain packing in the adenosine binding domain, and unfolds via an equilibrium intermediate not observed in the wild-type protein. After addition of ligand or the tight-binding inhibitor methotrexate, both the fragment complex and the circular permutant adopt more native-like secondary and tertiary structures. These results show that changes in the backbone connectivity can produce alternatively folded forms and highlight the importance of protein-ligand interactions in stabilizing the active site architecture of DHFR.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding properties of the trp repressor of Escherichia coli have been studied using a number of different time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence approaches. Denaturation by urea was monitored by the average fluorescence emission energy of the intrinsic tryptophan residues of the repressor. These data were consistent with a two-state transition from dimer to unfolded monomer with a free energy of unfolding of 19.2 kcal/mol. The frequency response profiles of the fluorescence emission brought to light subtle urea-induced modifications of the intrinsic tryptophan decay parameters both preceding and following the main unfolding transition. The increase of lifetime induced by urea required higher concentrations of urea than the increase in the total intensity described by Gittelman and Matthews [(1990) Biochemistry 29, 7011]. This indicates that the intensity increase has both dynamic and static origins. To assess the effect of tryptophan binding upon repressor stability, and to determine whether repressor oligomerization would be detectable in an unfolding experiment, we examined denaturation profiles of repressor labeled with the long-lived fluorescence probe 5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonyl (DNS), by monitoring the average rotational correlation time of the probe. These experiments revealed a protein concentration dependent transition at low urea concentrations. This transition was promoted by tryptophan binding. We ascribe this transition to urea-induced dissociation of repressor tetramers. The main unfolding transition of the dimer to unfolded monomer was also observable using this technique, and the free energies associated with this transition were 18.3 kcal/mol in the absence of tryptophan and 24.1 kcal/mol in its presence, demonstrating that co-repressor binding stabilizes the repressor dimer against denaturation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The dependence of delta G on urea concentration increases from 1850 cal mol-1 M-1 at high pH to about 3000 cal mol-1 M-1 near pH 3. This suggests that the unfolded conformations of barnase become more accessible to urea as the net charge on the molecule increases. Previous studies suggested that in 8 M urea barnase unfolds more completely than ribonuclease T1, even with the disulfide bonds broken [Pace, C.N., Laurents, D. V., & Thomson, J.A.

SPM4+ binding with the native protein at 25 degrees C was characterized by an association constant of approximately 2 x 10(4) M-1. This ligand also binds to the unfolded protein but with a approximately 35-fold lower affinity. Phosphate binds at the active site whereas Mg2+ and SPM4+ cations compete for binding at a polyanionic locus that probably involves residues Glu-28, Asp-29, and Glu-31 at the C-terminal end of the alpha-helix. Steady-state kinetic studies using minimal RNA substrates demonstrated that SPM4+ binding with the enzyme does not affect its catalytic activity. SPM4+ also preferentially binds with the folded form of the disulfide-reduced enzyme which has the same or slightly enhanced catalytic properties compared with native ribonuclease T1. The unfolding rate for the native protein in 8 M urea was approximately 8-fold lower in the presence of 0.05 M SPM4+.

        "abstract": "Here we investigate the effects of the naturally occurring threonine-linked L-fucose moiety on the structure, dynamics and stability of the proteinase inhibitor PMP-C (Pars intercerebralis major peptide C). The three-dimensional structure of PMP-C fucosylated on Thr 9 has been determined by NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing. The fucose ring is very well ordered, held in place by hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with Thr 16 and Arg 18. Comparing the NMR data and the structure of the fucosylated inhibitor with those of the nonfucosylated form shows that conformational changes only occur in the vicinity of the fucose moiety. Nevertheless, a comparative analysis of the exchange rates of amide protons indicates that fucosylation is responsible for an overall decrease of the dynamic fluctuations of the molecule. This correlates well with an increase in stability of approximately 1 kcal mol-1 as monitored by thermal denaturation.",

        "abstract": "Continuum methods were used to calculate the electrostatic contributions of charged and polar side chains to the overall stability of a small 41-residue helical protein, the peripheral subunit-binding domain. The results of these calculations suggest several residues that are destabilizing, relative to hydrophobic isosteres. One position was chosen to test the results of these calculations. Arg8 is located on the surface of the protein in a region of positive electrostatic potential. The calculations suggest that Arg8 makes a significant, unfavorable electrostatic contribution to the overall stability. The experiments described in this paper represent the first direct experimental test of the theoretical methods, taking advantage of solid-phase peptide synthesis to incorporate approximately isosteric amino acid substitutions. Arg8 was replaced with norleucine (Nle), an amino acid that is hydrophobic and approximately isosteric, or with alpha-amino adipic acid (Aad), which is also approximately isosteric but oppositely charged. In this manner, it is possible to isolate electrostatic interactions from the effects of hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions. Both Arg8Nle and Arg8Aad are more thermostable than the wild-type sequence, testifying to the validity of the calculations. These replacements led to stability increases at 52.6 degrees C, the T(m) of the wild-type, of 0.86 and 1.08 kcal mol(-)(1), respectively. The stability of Arg8Nle is particularly interesting as a rare case in which replacement of a surface charge with a hydrophobic residue leads to an increase in the stability of the protein.",

        "abstract": "Enzymes from thermophilic organisms often are barely active at low temperatures. To obtain a better understanding of this sluggishness, we used DNA shuffling to mutagenize the trpC gene, which encodes indoleglycerol phosphate synthase, from the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus. Mutants producing more active protein variants were selected by genetic complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant bearing a trpC deletion. Single amino acid changes and combinations of these changes improved growth appreciably. Five singly and doubly altered protein variants with changes at the N- and C-termini, or at the phosphate binding site, were purified and characterized with regard to their kinetics of enzymatic catalysis, product binding, cleavage by trypsin, and inactivation by heat. Turnover numbers of the purified variant proteins correlated with the corresponding growth rates, showing that the turnover number was the selected trait. Although the affinities for both the substrate and the product decreased appreciably in most protein variants, these defects were offset by the accumulation of high levels of the enzyme's substrate. Rapid mixing of the product indoleglycerol phosphate with the parental enzyme revealed that the enzyme's turnover number at low temperatures is limited by the dissociation of the enzyme-product complex. In contrast, representative protein variants bind and release the product far more rapidly, shifting the bottleneck to the preceding chemical step. The turnover number of the parental enzyme increases with temperature, suggesting that its structural rigidity is responsible for its poor catalytic activity at low temperatures. In support of this interpretation, the rate of trypsinolysis or of thermal denaturation is accelerated significantly in the activated protein variants.",

        "abstract": "The importance of two buried salt bridges in barnase in the stability of its folded state, the major transition rate for unfolding, and a folding intermediate has been analyzed by protein engineering, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies. The aspartate residues in the bridges Arg69-Asp93 and Arg83-Asp75 were replaced by the isosteric analogue asparagine, while various replacements were probed for the positively charged arginine partners. The mutations are very destabilizing, lowering stability by up to 5.4 kcal/mol. A value of 3.0-3.5 kcal/mol was derived for the coupling energy between Arg and Asp from a double mutant cycle analysis. Despite the radical nature of these mutations, they do not appear to alter the pathway of folding. The interaction between Arg69 and Asp93, located in a relatively conserved region among ribonucleases, is predominantly formed in the major transition state along the folding pathway, as found previously from an analysis of more benign mutations; the value of phi(F) for all mutations at positions 69 and 93 are 0.8-0.9 in the major transition state for folding where phi(F) = 0 = fully unfolded and phi(F) = 1 = fully folded interaction energies). In contrast, the interaction between Arg83 and Asp75 in the active site of barnase is formed only in the native state of the protein. The analysis of folding pathways and the structure of folding intermediates by making kinetic and thermodynamic measurements on mutants appears even more robust than expected.",

The physical properties of GB offer extraordinary flexibility for evaluating the energetics of the folding reaction. The protein is monomeric and very soluble in both folded and unfolded forms. The folding reaction has been previously examined by differential scanning calorimetry (Alexander et al., 1992) and found to exhibit two-state unfolding behavior over a wide pH range with an unfolding transition near 90 degrees C (GB1) at neutral pH. Here, the kinetics of folding and unfolding two naturally occurring versions of GB have been measured using stopped-flow mixing methods and analyzed according to transition-state theory. GB contains no prolines, and the kinetics of folding and unfolding can be fit to a single, first-order rate constant over the temperature range of 5-35 degrees C. The major thermodynamic changes going from the unfolded state to the transition state are (1) a large decrease in heat capacity (delta Cp), indicating that the transition state is compact and solvent inaccessible relative to the unfolded state; (2) a large loss of entropy; and (3) a small increase in enthalpy. The most surprising feature of the folding of GB compared to that of previously studied proteins is that its folding approximates a rapid diffusion controlled process with little increase in enthalpy going from the unfolded to the transition state.",

        "abstract": "Ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) carboxymethylated at the gamma-carboxyl group of Glu-58 with iodoacetic acid is known to be completely inactive while it retains an almost full substrate-binding ability. In order to further clarify the effects of the carboxymethylation, the thermal stabilities of intact and Glu-58-carboxymethylated (CM-) RNase T1 were compared by measuring 1H NMR spectra at various temperatures. The transition curves of unfolding were obtained by plotting, as a function of temperature, the peak areas for the alpha and delta protons of Asn-81 and Ile-90, respectively, which are well apart from each other in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. For each of intact and CM-RNase T1, the transition curve of the Asn-81 alpha proton was identical with that of the Ile-90 delta methyl protons, suggesting that the thermal unfolding occurred simultaneously in every part of the molecule of CM-RNase T1 as well as of intact RNase T1. The midpoint of unfolding was 52 degrees C for intact RNase T1, and was increased by 9 degrees C upon carboxymethylation at Glu-58. This marked stabilization by carboxymethylation is thought to be due to formation of a salt bridge between the introduced carboxymethyl group and the neighboring guanidium group of Arg-77.",

Several fragments (Sk1, Tr27, Tr17, Th26, and Th16) were isolated and characterized further. The N-terminal sequences of Tr27, Tr17, Th26, Th16 and the C-terminal sequences of Tr27 and Th26 were determined by partial sequencing. The evidence available allows the positioning of these fragments within the Sk sequence. Fragment Sk1 is obtained by carefully standardized tryptic digestion of Sk and gel chromatography under non-denaturing conditions. Sk1 is formed by a large polypeptide Ser60-Lys293 and non-covalently bonded smaller polypeptides composed of amino acids from the N-terminal region Ile1-Lys59 of Sk. Fragment Tr27 consists of the large polypeptide Ser60-Lys293 of Sk1, and can be obtained from Sk1 by removal of the smaller N-terminal polypeptides under denaturing conditions. Fragment Th26 is composed of amino acids Phe63-His291. The N-termini of fragments Tr17 and Th16 start with Glu148 and Ile151. From their electrophoretically-determined sizes it can be concluded that they most probably have the same C-terminal amino acids, Lys293 and His291, as fragments Tr27 and Th26, respectively. Secondary structure elements of similar composition were found in all the fragments studied using circular dichroism (c.d.) and infrared (i.r.) measurements. Differential scanning calorimetric (d.s.c.) measurements were performed in order to correlate the sequence regions of Sk to energetic folding units of the protein. Fragments Sk1, Tr27, Th26, Tr17, and Th16 show one melting peak in the temperature range from 42.8 to 46.1 degrees C (thermal unfolding stage). For fragment Sk1, this melting peak can be separated by deconvolution into two transitions at T1 = 46.1 degree C and T2 = 47.3 degrees C with delta H1 = 450 kJ/mol and delta H2 = 219 kJ/mol, respectively.

        "abstract": "Disulfide bridges have been introduced into barnase to act as probes of folding. One disulfide (between residues 85 and 102) links two loops known to pack together early in the folding pathway. A second disulfide bond (between residues 43 and 80) links two elements of secondary structure known to pack together only after the rate-determining step of folding. The disulfide-bridged proteins are more stable than wild-type by 4.1 and 1.2 kcal mol-1, respectively. The kinetics of unfolding and refolding of the mutant proteins has been measured, and a comparison of the disulfide proteins and their corresponding dithiol forms has been made by use of thermodynamic cycles. These data have been used to construct folding profiles of the disulfide proteins. The disulfide bond engineered into the part of the protein that folds early confers stability upon the intermediate and transition states of folding. The protein with a disulfide bond connecting parts of the protein that fold late is not stabilized until the protein reaches its final folded form. Conversely, in the unfolding pathway, the rate of unfolding of this mutant is lowered considerably. This points to a method of decreasing the rate of denaturation of proteins that are used in medical and biotechnological applications: elements of structure that unfold in or before the rate-determining step of overall unfolding may be stabilized and so slow down the overall unfolding process. The barnase mutant linked between Cys 43 and Cys 80, for example, unfolds 20 times slower than wild-type and 170 times slower than the reduced protein.",

        "abstract": "SecB is a cytosolic tetrameric chaperone in Escherichia coli, which maintains polypeptides, destined for export in a translocation competent state. The thermodynamics of unfolding of SecB was studied as a function of protein concentration, by using high sensitivity-differential scanning calorimetry and spectroscopic methods. The thermal unfolding of tetrameric SecB is reversible and can be well described as a two-state transition in which the folded tetramer is converted directly to unfolded monomers. Increasing the pH decreases the stability of the tetramer significantly, the T(m) changing from 341.3 K at pH 6.5 to 332.6 K at pH 9.5. The value of DeltaC(p) obtained from measurements of DeltaH(m) as a function of T(m) was 10.7 +/- 0.7 kcal mol(-1) K(-1). The value of DeltaC(p) is among the highest measured for a multimeric protein. At 298 K, pH 7.4, the DeltaG degrees (u) for the SecB tetramer is 27.9 +/- 2 kcal mol(-1). Denaturant-mediated unfolding of SecB was found to be irreversible. The reactivity of the four solvent-exposed free thiols in tetrameric SecB is salt dependent. The kinetics of reactivity suggests that these four cysteines are in close proximity to each other and that these residues on each monomer are in chemically identical environments. The thermodynamic data suggest that SecB is a stable, well-folded, and tightly packed tetramer and that substrate binding occurs at a surface site rather than at an interior cavity.",

In addition to the alphabeta enzyme, the beta subunit can self-associate to form a stable but inactive homodimer [Sinclair, J. F., Ziegler, M. M., and Baldwin, T. O. (1994) Nat. Struct. Biol. 1, 320-326]. The studies reported here were undertaken to explore the role of the subunit interface in the conformational stability of the enzyme. To this end, we constructed four mutant heterodimers in which residues at the subunit interface were changed in an effort to alter the volume of an apparent solvent accessible channel at the interface or to alter H-bonding groups. Equilibrium unfolding data for the heterodimer have been interpreted in terms of a three-state mechanism [Clark, C. A., Sinclair, J. F., and Baldwin, T. O. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10773-10779]. However, we found that unfolding for the wild-type and mutant luciferases is better described by a four-state model. This change in the proposed mechanism of unfolding is based on observation of residual structure in the subunits following dissociation of the heterodimeric intermediate. All of the mutants display modest reductions in activity but, surprisingly, no change in the DeltaG2H2O value for subunit dissociation and no measurable change in the equilibrium dissociation constant relative to that of the wild-type heterodimer. However, the DeltaG1H2O value for the formation of the dimeric intermediate that precedes subunit dissociation is reduced for three of the mutants, indicating that mutations at the interface can alter the stability of a region of the alpha subunit that is distant from the interface. We conclude that the interface region communicates with the distal domains of this subunit, probably through the active center region of the enzyme.",

Previous studies have indicated that BioI can hydroxylate fatty acids and may also perform an acyl bond cleavage reaction [Green, A. J., Rivers, S. L., Cheesman, M., Reid, G. A., Quaroni, L. G., Macdonald, I. D. G., Chapman, S. K., and Munro, A. W. (2001) J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 6, 523-533. Stok, J. E., and De Voss, J. J. (2000) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 384, 351-360]. Here we show novel binding features of P450 BioI--specifically that it binds steroids (including testosterone and progesterone) and polycyclic azole drugs with similar affinity to that for fatty acids (K(d) values in the range 0.1-160 microM). Sigmoidal binding curves for titration of BioI with azole drugs suggests a cooperative process in this case. BioI as isolated from Escherichia coli is in a mixed heme iron spin state. Alteration of the pH of the buffer system affects the heme iron spin-state equilibrium (higher pH increasing the low-spin content). Steroids containing a carbonyl group at the C(3) position induce a shift in heme iron spin-state equilibrium toward the low-spin form, whereas fatty acids produce a shift toward the high-spin form. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies confirm the heme iron spin-state perturbation inferred from optical titrations with steroids and fatty acids. Potentiometric studies demonstrate that the heme iron reduction potential becomes progressively more positive as the proportion of high-spin heme iron increases (potential for low-spin BioI = -330 +/- 1 mV; for BioI as purified from E. coli (mixed-spin) = 228 +/- 2 mV; for palmitoleic acid-bound BioI = -199 +/- 2 mV). Extraction of bound substrate-like molecule from purified BioI indicates palmitic acid to be bound. Differential scanning calorimetry studies indicate that the BioI protein structure is stabilized by binding of steroids and bulky azole drugs, a result confirmed by resonance Raman studies and by analysis of disruption of BioI secondary and tertiary structure by the chaotrope guanidinium chloride. Molecular modeling of the BioI structure indicates that a disulfide bond is present between Cys250 and Cys275. Calorimetry shows that structural stability of the protein was altered by addition of the reductant dithiothreitol, suggesting that the disulfide is important to integrity of BioI structure.",

Human and chicken annexins present a slightly different shape in the far-UV CD and IR spectra, but the main secondary-structure features are quite similar (70-80% alpha-helix). However, thermal stability of human annexin is significantly lower than its chicken counterpart (approximately 8 degrees C) and equivalent to the chicken N-terminally truncated form. The N-terminal extension contributes greatly to stabilize the overall annexin A5 structure. Infrared spectroscopy reveals the presence of two populations of alpha-helical structures, the canonical alpha-helices (approximately 1650 cm(-1)) and another, at a lower wavenumber (approximately 1634 cm(-1)), probably arising from helix-helix interactions or solvated alpha-helices. Saturation with calcium induces: alterations in the environment of the unique tryptophan residue of the recombinant proteins, as detected by near-UV CD spectroscopy; more compact tertiary structures that could account for the higher thermal stabilities (8 to 12 degrees C), this effect being higher for human annexin; and an increase in canonical alpha-helix percentage by a rearrangement of nonperiodical structure or 3(10) helices together with a variation in helix-helix interactions, as shown by amide I curve-fitting and 2D-IR.",

        "title": "Long-range dynamic effects of point mutations propagate through side chains in the serine protease inhibitor eglin c.", 
        "abstract": "Long-range interactions are fundamental to protein behaviors such as cooperativity and allostery. In an attempt to understand the role protein flexibility plays in such interactions, the distribution of local fluctuations in a globular protein was monitored in response to localized, nonelectrostatic perturbations. Two valine-to-alanine mutations were introduced into the small serine protease inhibitor eglin c, and the (15)N and (2)H NMR spin relaxation properties of these variants were analyzed in terms of the Lipari-Szabo dynamics formalism and compared to those of the wild type. Significant changes in picosecond to nanosecond dynamics were observed in side chains located as much as 13 A from the point of mutation. Additionally, those residues experiencing altered dynamics appear to form contiguous surfaces within the protein. In the case of V54A, the large-to-small mutation results in a rigidification of connected residues, even though this mutation decreases the global stability. These findings suggest that dynamic perturbations arising from single mutations may propagate away from the perturbed site through networks of interacting side chains. That this is observed in eglin c, a classically nonallosteric protein, suggests that such behavior will be observed in many, if not all, globular proteins. Differences in behavior between the two mutants suggest that dynamic responses will be context-dependent.",

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding of eglin c, a small proteinase inhibitor of molecular weight 8.1 kDa, is studied by means of high sensitivity scanning calorimetry over a wide pH range in dilute buffer solutions, and in the presence of varying concentrations of guanidinium chloride at pH 7.00 and 10.55. The temperature of half-completion of the unfolding transition, t1/2, in dilute buffer varies from 41 degrees C at pH 1.1 to 86 degrees C at pH 7.0 to 10.55, with corresponding enthalpy changes of approximately 40 kcal mol-1 and 71 kcal mol-1. This latter enthalpy change, amounting to 8.7 cal g-1, is unusually large for a protein, especially for one of unusually small molecular weight. Addition of 3.3 M guanidinium chloride at pH 10.55 lowered t1/2 from 86 degrees C to 40 degrees C and decreased the enthalpy change from approximately 71 kcal mol-1 to 25 kcal mol-1.",

        "abstract": "A human lysozyme expression system by Pichia pastoris was constructed with the expression vector of pPIC9, which contains the alpha-factor signal peptide known for high secretion efficiency. P. pastoris expressed the human lysozyme at about 300 mg/l broth, but four extra residues (Glu(-4)-Ala(-3)-Glu(-2)-Ala(-1)-) were added at the N-terminus of the expressed protein (EAEA-lysozyme). To determine the effect of the four extra residues on the stability, structures and folding of the protein, calorimetry, X-ray crystal analysis and GuHCl denaturation experiments were performed. The calorimetric studies showed that the EAEA-lysozyme was destabilized by 9.6 kJ/mol at pH 2.7 compared with the wild-type protein, mainly caused by the substantial decrease in the enthalpy change (DeltaH). On the basis of structural information on the EAEA-lysozyme, thermodynamic analyses show that (1) the addition of the four residues slightly affected the conformation in other parts far from the N-terminus, (2) the large decrease in the enthalpy change due to the conformational changes would be almost compensated by the decrease in the entropy change and (3) the decrease in the Gibbs energy change between the EAEA and wild-type human lysozymes could be explained by the summation of each Gibbs energy change contributing to the stabilizing factors concerning the extra residues.",

        "abstract": "The energetics of barstar denaturation have been studied by CD and scanning microcalorimetry in an extended range of pH and salt concentration. It was shown that, upon increasing temperature, barstar undergoes a transition to the denatured state that is well approximated by a two-state transition in solutions of high ionic strength. This transition is accompanied by significant heat absorption and an increase in heat capacity. The denaturational heat capacity increment at approximately 75 degrees C was found to be 5.6 +/- 0.3 kJ K-1 mol-1. In all cases, the value of the measured enthalpy of denaturation was notably lower than those observed for other small globular proteins. In order to explain this observation, the relative contributions of hydration and the disruption of internal interactions to the total enthalpy and entropy of unfolding were calculated. The enthalpy and entropy of hydration were found to be in good agreement with those calculated for other proteins, but the enthalpy and entropy of breaking internal interactions were found to be among the lowest for all globular proteins that have been studied. Additionally, the partial specific heat capacity of barstar in the native state was found to be 0.37 +/- 0.03 cal K-1 g-1, which is higher than what is observed for most globular proteins and suggests significant flexibility in the native state. It is known from structural data that barstar undergoes a conformational change upon binding to its natural substrate barnase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The cytosolic malic enzyme from the pigeon liver is sensitive to chemical denaturant urea. When monitored by protein intrinsic fluorescence or circular dichroism spectral changes, an unfolding of the enzyme in urea at 25 degrees C and pH 7.4 revealed a biphasic phenomenon with an intermediate state detected at 4-5 m urea. The enzyme activity was activated by urea up to 1 m but was completely lost before the intermediate state was detected. This suggests that the active site region of the enzyme was more sensitive to chemical denaturant than other structural scaffolds. In the presence of 4 mm Mn(2+), the urea denaturation pattern of malic enzyme changed to monophasic. Mn(2+) helped the enzyme to resist phase I urea denaturation. The [urea](0.5) for the enzyme inactivation shifted from 2.2 to 3.8 m. Molecular weight determined by the analytical ultracentrifuge indicated that the tetrameric enzyme was dissociated to dimers in the early stage of phase I denaturation. In the intermediate state at 4-5 m urea, the enzyme showed polymerization. However, the polymer forms were dissociated to unfolded monomers at a urea concentration greater than 6 m. Mn(2+) retarded the polymerization of the malic enzyme. Three mutants of the enzyme with a defective metal ligand (E234Q, D235N, E234Q/D235N) were cloned and purified to homogeneity. These mutant malic enzymes showed a biphasic urea denaturation pattern in the absence or presence of Mn(2+). These results indicate that the Mn(2+) has dual roles in the malic enzyme. The metal ion not only plays a catalytic role in stabilization of the reaction intermediate, enol-pyruvate, but also stabilizes the overall tetrameric protein architecture.",

        "abstract": "Some 50% of human cancers are associated with mutations in the core domain of the tumor suppressor p53. Many mutations are thought just to destabilize the protein. To assess this and the possibility of rescue, we have set up a system to analyze the stability of the core domain and its mutants. The use of differential scanning calorimetry or spectroscopy to measure its melting temperature leads to irreversible denaturation and aggregation and so is useful as only a qualitative guide to stability. There are excellent two-state denaturation curves on the addition of urea that may be analyzed quantitatively. One Zn2+ ion remains tightly bound in the holo-form of p53 throughout the denaturation curve. The stability of wild type is 6.0 kcal (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ)/mol at 25 degrees C and 9.8 kcal/mol at 10 degrees C. The oncogenic mutants R175H, C242S, R248Q, R249S, and R273H are destabilized by 3.0, 2.9, 1.9, 1.9, and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Under certain denaturing conditions, the wild-type domain forms an aggregate that is relatively highly fluorescent at 340 nm on excitation at 280 nm.

        "abstract": "The effects of lacking a specific disulfide bridge on the transition state in folding were examined in order to explore the folding-unfolding mechanism of lysozyme. Four species of three-disulfide variant of hen lysozyme (3SS-lysozyme) were prepared by replacing two Cys residues with Ala or Ser: C6S/C127A, C30A/C115A, C64A/C80A and C76A/C94A. The recombinant hen lysozyme was studied as the standard reference containing four authentic disulfide bridges and the extra N-terminal Met: the recombinant hen lysozyme containing the extra N-terminal. Folding rates were measured by monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity associated with tri-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine binding to the active site of refolded lysozyme. It was confirmed that the folding rate of the recombinant hen lysozyme containing the extra N-terminal was the same as that of wild-type lysozyme, and that the folding rate was little affected by the presence of tri-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (triNAG). The folding rate of C64A/C80A was found to be the fastest and almost the same as that of the recombinant hen lysozyme containing the extra N-terminal, and that of C30A/C115A the second, and that of C6S/C127A the third. The folding rate of C76A/C94A was particularly slow. On the other hand, the unfolding rates which were measured in the presence of triNAG showed the dependence on the concentration of triNAG. The intrinsic unfolding rate in the absence of triNAG was determined by extrapolation. Also in the unfolding rate, C76A/C94A was markedly slower than the others. It was found from the analysis of binding constants of triNAG to C64A/C80A during the unfolding process that the active site of C64A/C80A partly unfolds already prior to the unfolding transition. On the basis of these kinetic data, we suggest that C64A/C80A folding transition can occur with leaving the loop region around SS3 (C64-C80) flexible, while cross-linking by SS4 (C76-C94) is important for the promotion of folding, because it is an indispensable constraint on the way towards the folding transition state.",

        "abstract": "Calreticulin (CRT) is a soluble chaperone involved in the conformational maturation of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Using biochemical and biophysical techniques including circular dichroism, proteolysis, and analytical ultracentrifugation, we have determined the effects of calcium and zinc ions on the structural properties of human CRT. Circular dichroism analysis has shown that the binding of calcium and zinc ions to CRT induces no significant changes in the secondary structure of the protein but affects in very distinct ways the local tertiary packing of these elements. More specifically, these studies have revealed that CRT adopts a more rigid and thermally stable structure upon binding calcium ions and a more loosely packed and thermally destabilized structure upon binding zinc ions. Consistent with these results, proteolysis experiments demonstrated that the intrinsic conformational flexibility of CRT can be modulated toward either a decrease or an increase in susceptibility to cleavage by chymotrypsin upon binding calcium or zinc ions, respectively. Results from sedimentation analysis indicated that the global three-dimensional structure of CRT is essentially unchanged upon binding calcium ions. In marked contrast, CRT self-associates reversibly to form dimers upon binding zinc ions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that calcium and zinc ions induce strikingly different changes in the biochemical and structural properties of CRT.",

        "abstract": "We have examined the influence of surface hydrogen bonds on the stability of proteins by studying the effects of mutations of human immunoglobulin light chain variable domain (V(L)). In addition to the variants Y27dD, N28F, and T94H of protein kappa IV Len that were previously described, we characterized mutants M4L, L27cN, L27cQ, and K39T, double mutant M4L/Y27dD, and triple mutant M4L/Y27dD/T94H. The triple mutant had an enhanced thermodynamic stability of 4.2 kcal/mol. We determined the structure of the triple mutant by x-ray diffraction and correlated the changes in stability due to the mutations with changes in the three-dimensional structure. Y27dD mutant had increased stability of Len by 2.7 kcal/mol, a large value for a single mutation. Asp27d present in CDR1 formed hydrogen bonds with the side-chain and main-chain atoms within the loop. In the case of the K39T mutant, which reduces stability by 2 kcal/mol, Lys39 in addition to forming a hydrogen bond with a carbonyl oxygen of a neighboring loop may also favorably influence the surface electrostatics of the molecule. We showed that hydrogen bonds between residues in surface loops can add to the overall stability of the V(L) domains. The contribution to stability is further increased if the surface residue makes more than one hydrogen bond or if it forms a hydrogen bond between neighboring turns or loops separated from each other in the amino acid sequence. Based on our experiments we suggest that stabilization of proteins might be systematically accomplished by introducing additional hydrogen bonds on the surface. These substitutions are more straightforward to predict than core-packing interactions and can be selected to avoid affecting the protein's function.",

        "abstract": "The G-protein coupled receptor, rhodopsin, consists of seven transmembrane helices which are buried in the lipid bilayer and are connected by loop domains extending out of the hydrophobic core. The thermal stability of rhodopsin and its bleached form, opsin, was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal transitions were asymmetric, and the temperatures of the thermal transitions were scan rate dependent. This dependence exhibited characteristics of a two-state irreversible denaturation in which intermediate states rapidly proceed to the final irreversible state. These studies suggest that the denaturation of both rhodopsin and opsin is kinetically controlled. The denaturation of the intact protein was compared to three proteolytically cleaved forms of the protein. Trypsin removed nine residues of the carboxyl terminus, papain removed 28 residues of the carboxyl terminus and a portion of the third cytoplasmic loop, and chymotrypsin cleaved cytoplasmic loops 2 and 3. In each of these cases the fragments remained associated as a complex in the membrane. DSC studies were carried out on each of the fragmented proteins. In all of the samples the scan rate dependence of the Tm indicated that the transition was kinetically controlled. Trypsin-proteolyzed protein differed little from the intact protein. However, the activation energy for denaturation was decreased when cytoplasmic loop 3 was cleaved by papain or chymotrypsin. This was observed for both bleached and unbleached samples. In the presence of the chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, the noncovalent interactions among the proteolytic fragments produced by papain and chymotrypsin cleavage were sufficiently strong such that each of the complexes denatured as a unit. Upon bleaching, the papain fragments exhibited a single thermal transition. However, after bleaching, the chymotrypsin fragments exhibited two calorimetric transitions. These data suggest that the loops of rhodopsin exert a stabilizing effect on the protein.",

The equilibrium denaturation free energy values, obtained by linearly extrapolating the data to vanishing denaturant (DeltaG(D)(H2O)), are compared and discussed. The fit of the spectroscopic data monitoring the denaturation of BLG has been approached, at first, with a two-state model that describes the protein transition from the folded state (at each pH and in the absence of denaturant) to the denatured state, but in particular, along the GuHCl denaturation pathway some evidence is found of the presence of an intermediate state. Time-resolved fluorescence experiments performed on the BLG-ANS (1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate) complex help to understand the results. Fluorescence polarization anisotropy (FPA) measurements accompanying the denaturation process show the presence of a fast rotational diffusion of the ANS probe, and the data are interpreted in terms of local fluctuations of a still structured tract of the denatured protein where the probe is bound.",

        "abstract": "The conformational stability of RNase Rs was determined with chemical and thermal denaturants over the pH range of 1-10. Equilibrium unfolding with urea showed that values of D(1/2) (5.7 M) and DeltaG(H(2)O) (12.8 kcal/mol) were highest at pH 5.0, its pI and the maximum conformational stability of RNase Rs was observed near pH 5.0. Denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), at pH 5.0, gave similar values of DeltaG(H(2)O) although GdnHCl was 2-fold more potent denaturant with D(1/2) value of 3.1 M. The curves of fraction unfolded (f(U)) obtained with fluorescence and CD measurements overlapped at pH 5.0. Denaturation of RNase Rs with urea in the pH range studied was reversible but the enzyme denatured irreversibly >pH 11.0. Thermal denaturation of RNase Rs was reversible in the pH range of 2.0-3.0 and 6.0-9.0. Thermal denaturation in the pH range 4.0-5.5 resulted in aggregation and precipitation of the protein above 55 degrees C. The aggregate was amorphous or disordered precipitate as observed in TE micrographs. Blue shift in emission lambda(max) and enhancement of fluorescence intensity of ANS at 70 degrees C indicated the presence of solvent exposed hydrophobic surfaces as a result of heat treatment. Aggregation could be prevented partially with alpha-cyclodextrin (0.15 M) and completely with urea at concentrations >3 M. Aggregation was probably due to intermolecular hydrophobic interaction favored by minimum charge-charge repulsion at the pI of the enzyme. Both urea and temperature-induced denaturation studies showed that RNase Rs unfolds through a two-state F right arrow over left arrow U mechanism. The pH dependence of stability described by DeltaG(H(2)O) (urea) and DeltaG (25 degrees C) suggested that electrostatic interactions among the charged groups make a significant contribution to the conformational stability of RNase Rs. Since RNase Rs is a disulfide-containing protein, the major element for structural stability are the covalent disulfide bonds.",

        "abstract": "The SH3 domain folding transition state structure contains two well-ordered turn regions, known as the diverging turn and the distal loop. In the Src SH3 domain transition state, these regions are stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Glu30 in the diverging turn and Ser47 in the distal loop. We have examined the effects on folding kinetics of amino acid substitutions at the homologous positions (Glu24 and Ser41) in the Fyn SH3 domain. In contrast to most other folding kinetics studies which have focused primarily on non-disruptive substitutions with Ala or Gly, here we have examined the effects of substitutions with diverse amino acid residues. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the transition state structure is generally tolerant to amino acid substitutions. We also uncover a unique role for Ser at position 41 in facilitating folding of the distal loop, which can only be replicated by Asp at the same position. Both these residues appear to accelerate folding through the formation of short-range side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds. The folding of the diverging turn region is shown to be driven primarily by local interactions. The diverging turn and distal loop regions are found to interact in the transition state structure, but only in the context of particular mutant backgrounds. This work demonstrates that studying the effects of a variety of amino acid substitutions on protein folding kinetics can provide unique insights into folding mechanisms which cannot be obtained by standard Phi value analysis.",

        "abstract": "Effects of amino acid substitutions at four fully buried sites of the ubiquitin molecule on the thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, Gibbs energy) of unfolding were evaluated experimentally using differential scanning calorimetry. The same set of substitutions has been incorporated at each of four sites. These substitutions have been designed to perturb packing (van der Waals) interactions, hydration, and/or hydrogen bonding. From the analysis of the thermodynamic parameters for these ubiquitin variants we conclude that: (i) packing of non-polar groups in the protein interior is favorable and is largely defined by a favorable enthalpy of van der Waals interactions. The removal of one methylene group from the protein interior will destabilize a protein by approximately 5 kJ/mol, and will decrease the enthalpy of a protein by 12 kJ/mol. (ii) Burial of polar groups in the non-polar interior of a protein is highly destabilizing, and the degree of destabilization depends on the relative polarity of this group. For example, burial of Thr side-chain in the non-polar interior will be less destabilizing than burial of Asn side-chain. This decrease in stability is defined by a large enthalpy of dehydration of polar groups upon burial. (iii) The destabilizing effect of dehydration of polar groups upon burial can be compensated if these buried polar groups form hydrogen bonding. The enthalpy of this hydrogen bonding will compensate for the unfavorable dehydration energy and as a result the effect will be energetically neutral or even slightly stabilizing.",

The binding of mAb with lysozyme was decreased both by denaturation with heat and guanidine-HCl, corresponding to the denaturation curves of lysozyme. These results demonstrate that mAb is a powerful probe to monitor the conformational changes in the lysozyme molecule. By using this probe, the conformational change of various mutant lysozymes was detected. A good correlation was observed between the binding with mAb and the delta G (Gibbs free energy change), reflecting the conformational stability of wild-type and seven mutant lysozymes.

The mutation of His83 resulted in a marked increase in Km along with an increase in kcat. The mutation of His114 caused a large reduction in both the free energy of unfolding in water, delta GH2O, and the mid-point of the unfolding curve, [D]1/2. These results indicate that His83, which is one of the four well-exposed histidine residues in the crystal structure, is located close to a substrate-binding site, and His114, which is buried inside the protein molecule, contributes to the conformational stability, probably through the formation of a hydrogen bond with a main-chain carbonyl group. None of the histidine residues is required for activity.",

Here, we have used a recombinant form of this fragment to investigate molten globule energetics and to derive structural information by equilibrium Phi-analysis. We have characterized 15 mutant fragments designed to probe the persistence of native interactions in the molten globule and compared their conformational stability to that of the equivalent full-length apoflavodoxin mutants. According to our data, most of the mutations analysed modify the stability of the molten globule fragment following the trend observed when the same mutations are implemented in the full-length protein. However, the changes in stability observed in the molten globule are much smaller and the Phi-values calculated are (with a single exception) below 0.4. This is consistent with an overall and significant debilitation of the native structure. Nevertheless, the fact that the molten globule fragment can be stabilised using as a guide the native structure of the full-length protein (by increasing helix propensity, optimising charge interactions and filling small cavities) suggests that the overall structure of the molten globule is still quite close to native, in spite of the lowered stability observed.",

        "abstract": "The urea-induced unfolding of the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase alpha-subunit is examined via fluorescence measurements with tryptophan-containing alpha-subunit mutants, constructed by in vitro mutagenesis. Early unfolding studies with urea and guanidine suggested that the wild type protein unfolded in a two-step process with a stable intermediate composed of a native alpha-1 folding unit (residues 1-188) and a completely unfolded alpha-2 folding unit (residues 189-268). Recently, more detailed spectroscopic and calorimetric data from the Matthews and Yutani groups indicate that such a structure for the intermediates seems unlikely. Previously, we described the introduction of Trp residues as unfolding reporter groups separately into each of the folding domains and showed that these proteins are wild type enzymatically and in their stability to urea. The unfolding behavior of these alpha-subunits, monitored by fluorescence intensity changes at the discrete emission lambda max for each, in both equilibrium and kinetic experiments, suggest that: (a) both folding units commence unfolding simultaneously (near 2 M urea); (b) the larger alpha-1 unit unfolds in a multistep process, initially yielding a partially unfolded intermediate form which subsequently appears to unfold progressively to completion; and (c) the smaller alpha-2 unit unfolds in a single step event. These results are also clearly incompatible with the early proposals on the structure of the intermediate. It is suggested here that the intermediate is heterogeneous, consisting of a stable, partially unfolded form of alpha-1 attached to either a completely folded or completely unfolded form of alpha-2. These results are consistent with and provide an added dimension to the recent description of the proposed structure of the intermediate.",

        "abstract": "The thermal stability of acid-soluble collagen type I from calf skin in salt solutions is studied by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. Three concentration ranges have been clearly distinguished in the dependence of collagen thermal stability on ion concentration. At concentrations below 20 mM, all studied salts reduce the temperature of collagen denaturation with a factor of about 0.2 degree C per 1 mM. This effect is attributed to screening of electrostatic interactions leading to collagen stabilisation. At higher concentrations, roughly in the range 20-500 mM, the different salts either slightly stabilise or further destabilise the collagen molecule in salt-specific way that correlates with their position in the lyotropic series. The effect of anions is dominating and follows the order H2PO4- > or = SO4(2-) > Cl- > SCN-, with sign inversion at about SO4(2-). This effect, generally known as the Hofmeister effect, is associated with indirect protein-salt interactions exerted via competition for water molecules between ions and the protein surface. At still higher salt concentrations (onset concentrations between 200 and 800 mM for the different salts), the temperature of collagen denaturation and solution opacity markedly increase for all studied salts due to protein salting out and aggregation. The ability of salts to salt out collagen also correlates with their position in the lyotropic series and increases for chaotropic ions. The SO4(2-) anions interact specifically with collagen - they induce splitting of the protein denaturation peak into two components in the range 100-150 mM Na2SO4 and 300-750 mM Li2SO4. The variations of the collagen denaturation enthalpy at low and intermediate salt concentrations are consistent with a weak linear increase of the enthalpy with denaturation temperature. Its derivative, d(delta H)/dT, is approximately equal to the independently measured difference in the heat capacities of the denatured and native states, delta Cp = Cp(D) - Cp(N) approximately 0.1 cal.g-1 K-1.",

Combination of these data with published dissociation constants [Scopes, R.K. (1978) Eur. J.

The temperature of half-completion, t 1/2, of the denaturation and the denaturational enthalpy are increased by the binding of the ligands, the increase in t 1/2 being a manifestation of Le Chatelier's principle and that in enthalpy reflecting the enthalpy of dissociation of the ligand.

        "abstract": "The effects of pH and temperature on the stability of interdomain interactions of colicin B have been studied by differential-scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The calorimetric properties were compared with those of the isolated pore-forming fragment. The unfolding profile of the full-length toxin is consistent with two endothermic transitions. Whereas peak A (T(m) = 55 degrees C) most likely corresponds to the receptor/translocation domain, peak B (T(m) = 59 degrees C) is associated with the pore-forming domain. By lowering the pH from 7 to 3.5, the transition temperature of peaks A and B are reduced by 25 and 18 degrees C, respectively, due to proton exchange upon denaturation. The isolated pore-forming fragment unfolds at much higher temperatures (T(m) = 65 degrees C) and is stable throughout a wide pH range, indicating that intramolecular interactions between the different colicin B domains result in a less stable protein conformation. In aqueous solution circular dichroism spectra have been used to estimate the content of helical secondary structure of colicin B ( approximately 40%) or its pore-forming fragment ( approximately 80%). Upon heating, the ellipticities at 222 nm strongly decrease at the transition temperature. In the presence of lipid vesicles the differential-scanning calorimetry profiles of the pore-forming fragment exhibit a low heat of transition multicomponent structure. The heat of transition of membrane-associated colicin B (T(m) = 54 degrees C at pH 3.5) is reduced and its secondary structure is conserved even at intermediate temperatures indicating incomplete unfolding due to strong protein-lipid interactions.",

Quantitative analysis of the CD and fluorescence denaturation profiles revealed that unfolding occurred by a two-state process and the mutant was less stable than the WT. Even in the denatured state, the mutation caused chemical shift perturbations and significant differences were observed in the 15N transverse relaxation rates (R2), not only at the mutation site but all around.

        "abstract": "In a systematic attempt to identify residues important in the folding and stability of T4 lysozyme, five amino acids within alpha-helix 126-134 were substituted by alanine, either singly or in selected combinations. Together with three alanines already present in the wild-type structure this provided a set of mutant proteins with up to eight alanines in sequence. All the variants behaved normally, suggesting that the majority of residues in the alpha-helix are nonessential for the folding of T4 lysozyme. Of the five individual alanine substitutions it is inferred that four result in slightly increased protein stability and one, the replacement of a buried leucine with alanine, substantially decreased stability. The results support the idea that alanine is a residue of high helix propensity. The change in protein stability observed for each of the multiple mutants is approximately equal to the sum of the energies associated with each of the constituent substitutions. All of the variants could be crystallized isomorphously with wild-type lysozyme, and, with one trivial exception, their structures were determined at high resolution. Substitution of the largely solvent-exposed residues Asp 127, Glu 128, and Val 131 with alanine caused essentially no change in structure except at the immediate site of replacement. Substitutions of the partially buried Asn 132 and the buried Leu 133 with alanine were associated with modest (< or = 0.4 A) structural adjustments. The structural changes seen in the multiple mutants were essentially a combination of those seen in the constituent single replacements. The different replacements therefore act essentially independently not only so far as changes in energy are concerned but also in their effect on structure. The destabilizing replacement Leu 133-->Ala made alpha-helix 126-134 somewhat less regular. Incorporation of additional alanine replacements tended to make the helix more uniform. For the penta-alanine variant a distinct change occurred in a crystal-packing contact, and the \"hinge-bending angle\" between the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains changed by 3.6 degrees. This tends to confirm that such hinge-bending in T4 lysozyme is a low-energy conformational change.",

        "abstract": "Apomyoglobin adopts a partly folded intermediate conformation (I), sometimes referred to as a molten globule intermediate, near pH 4. To determine which histidine residues trigger this partial unfolding reaction, we made mutants in which nine of the twelve histidine residues in the protein are substituted individually. We then measured acid and urea-induced unfolding curves for these substituted proteins. Two acid unfolding transitions are observed: native (N) to intermediate (I), and I to unfolded (U). These data were fitted using a simple three-state model which has been shown to give an adequate description of acid and urea-induced unfolding of wild-type apomyoglobin. The aim is to quantify changes in the apparent standard Gibbs energy differences between N, I and U, as well as the unfolding mechanism, that result from these substitutions, and to test how well the model fits data for substituted proteins. In most cases, the model fits the data reasonably well, and significant changes in fitted unfolding parameters of various mutants are also clearly visible in the primary data. The following conclusions are drawn. (1) Histidines 24 and 119 synergistically stabilize native apomyoglobin (N) at pH 8, but together destabilize N as pH is decreased below seven. (2) Histidine 36 stabilizes N when it is protonated. (3) Histidine substitutions in the heme-binding pocket (residues 64, 93 and 97) have little effect on the stability of N, suggesting that the heme-binding pocket is open. (4) Histidine substitutions affect the N to I transition but have little effect on the I to U transition. (5) The simple model we use to describe the unfolding of apomyoglobin cannot account for all the data, particularly the effects of the H36Q mutation. The effect of protonated histidine 36 on stabilizing N is not included in the model. We suggest that breaking the hydrogen bond between histidines 24 and 119 by protonation when the pH is decreased from 6 to 4 is an important part of triggering the partial unfolding of N to I, and likewise that formation of the hydrogen bond between histidines 24 and 119 may be a rate-determining step in the kinetic process of forming N from I during refolding.",

        "abstract": "Native-state hydrogen exchange (HX) studies, used in conjunction with NMR spectroscopy, have been carried out on Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx) for characterizing two folding subdomains of the protein. The backbone amide protons of only the slowest-exchanging 24 amino acid residues, of a total of 108 amino acid residues, could be followed at pH 7. The free energy of the opening event that results in an amide hydrogen exchanging with solvent (DeltaG(op)) was determined at each of the 24 amide hydrogen sites. The values of DeltaG(op) for the amide hydrogens belonging to residues in the helices alpha(1), alpha(2), and alpha(4) are consistent with them exchanging with the solvent only when the fully unfolded state is sampled transiently under native conditions. The denaturant-dependences of the values of DeltaG(op) provide very little evidence that the protein samples partially unfolded forms, lower in energy than the unfolded state. The amide hydrogens belonging to the residues in the beta strands, which form the core of the protein, appear to have higher values of DeltaG(op) than amide hydrogens belonging to residues in the helices, suggesting that they might be more stable to exchange. This apparently higher stability to HX of the beta strands might be either because they exchange out their amide hydrogens in a high energy intermediate preceding the globally unfolded state, or, more likely, because they form residual structure in the globally unfolded state. In either case, the central beta strands-beta(3,) beta(2), and beta(4)-would appear to form a cooperatively folding subunit of the protein. The native-state HX methodology has made it possible to characterize the free energy landscape that Trx can sample under equilibrium native conditions.",

        "abstract": "DnaK, a Hsp70 acting in concert with its co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE, is essential for Escherichia coli to survive environmental stress, including exposure to elevated temperatures. Here we explored the influence of temperature on the structure of the individual components and the functional properties of the chaperone system. GrpE undergoes extensive but fully reversible conformational changes in the physiologically relevant temperature range (transition midpoint at approximately 48 degrees C), as observed with both circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry, whereas no thermal transitions occur in DnaK and DnaJ between 15 degrees C and 48 degrees C. The conformational changes in GrpE appear to be important in controlling the interconversion of T-state DnaK (ATP-liganded, low affinity for polypeptide substrates) and R-state DnaK (ADP-liganded, high affinity for polypeptide substrates). The rate of the T --> R conversion of DnaK due to DnaJ-triggered ATP hydrolysis follows an Arrhenius temperature dependence. In contrast, the rate of the R --> T conversion due to GrpE-catalyzed ADP/ATP exchange increases progressively less with increasing temperature and even decreases at temperatures above approximately 40 degrees C, indicating a temperature-dependent reversible inactivation of GrpE. At heat-shock temperatures, the reversible structural changes of GrpE thus shift DnaK toward its high-affinity R state.",

        "abstract": "The gene yhdA from Bacillus subtilis encoding a putative flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent oxidoreductase was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme has a noncovalently bound FMN cofactor, which is preferentially reduced by NADPH, indicating that YhdA is a NADPH:FMN oxidoreductase. The rate of NADPH oxidation is enhanced by the addition of external FMN, and analysis of initial rate measurements reveals the occurrence of a ternary complex in a bi-bi reaction mechanism. YhdA has also been shown to reductively cleave the -N=N- bond in azo dyes at the expense of NADPH, and hence, it possesses azoreductase activity, however, at a rate 100 times slower than that found for FMN. Using Cibacron Marine as a model compound, we could demonstrate that the dye is a competitive inhibitor of NADPH and FMN. The utilization of NADPH and the absence of a flavin semiquinone radical distinguish YhdA from flavodoxins, which adopt the same structural fold, i.e., a five-stranded beta sheet sandwiched by five alpha helices. The native molecular-mass of YhdA was determined to be 76 kDa, suggesting that the protein occurs as a tetramer, whereas the YhdA homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YLR011wp) forms a dimer in solution. Interestingly, the different oligomerization of these homologous proteins correlates to their thermostability, with YhdA exhibiting a melting point of 86.5 degrees C, which is 26.3 degrees C higher than that for the yeast protein. This unusually high melting point is proposed to be the result of increased hydrophobic packing between dimers and the additional presence of four salt bridges stabilizing the dimer-dimer interface.",

        "abstract": "To decrease irreversible thermoinactivation of Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase, five Gly residues causing helix flexibility were replaced with Ala residues. Mutation of Gly57 did not affect thermostability. Mutation of Gly137 doubled it at pHs 3.5 and 4.5 but barely changed it at pH 5.5. The Gly139-->Ala mutation did not change thermostability at pH 3.5, improved it at pH 4.5 and worsened it at pH 5.5. The Gly 137/Gly139-->Ala/Ala mutation gave 1.5-2-fold increased thermostabilities at pHs 3.5-5.5. Mutations of Gly251 and Gly383 decreased it at all pHs. Gly137-->Ala and Gly137/Gly139-->Ala/Ala glucoamylases are the most stable yet produced by mutation. Guanidine treatment at pH 4.5 decreased the reversible stabilities of Gly137-->Ala, Gly139-->Ala and Gly137/Gly139-->Ala/Ala glucoamylases at infinite dilution while not changing those of Gly251-->Ala and Gly383-->Ala glucoamylases, which is, in general, opposite to what occurred with thermoinactivation. Mutation of Gly57 greatly improved the extracellular glucoamylase production by yeast, that of Gly137 barely affected it and those of Gly139 and of both Gly137 and Gly139 strongly impeded it. These observations suggest that alpha-helix rigidity can affect reversible and irreversible glucoamylase stability differently, that the effects of multiple mutations within one alpha-helix to improve stability are not always additive and that even single mutations can strongly affect extracellular enzyme production.",

        "abstract": "We have examined the stabilities of the catalytic and binding domains of glucoamylase 1 from Aspergillus niger and how these stabilities are affected by the O-glycosylated linker glycopeptide which separates the domains. On heating, the catalytic domain unfolds irreversibly, whereas the binding domain unfolds reversibly as shown by differential scanning calorimetry and by 1H NMR. The stability of three functional peptides, derived from glucoamylase 1, containing the binding domain alone and with 10 or 38 residues of the linker glycopeptide [Williamson, G., Belshaw, N.J. and Williamson, M. (1992) Biochem. J. 282, 423-428] was examined. Refolding in each case was reversible after thermal or chemical denaturation. beta-Cyclodextrin stabilised the binding domain by the same amount when it was part of glucoamylase 1 or an isolated domain. The thermal stability of the catalytic domain was not affected by the binding domain; however, the catalytic domain increased the melting temperature of the binding domain. Furthermore, the linker glycopeptide stabilised the binding domain against reversible thermal and chemical denaturation by about 10 kJ/mol, but only a portion of the O-glycosylated residues were required for stabilisation. On a simple molecular mass basis, the linker glycopeptide does not contribute as much as expected to the denaturational enthalpy of glucoamylase 1 and, in addition, shows only a small conformational change on chemical or thermal denaturation; this supports an extended structure for the linker. The results demonstrate that the unfolding pathway of glucoamylase 1 depends on the concentration of beta-cyclodextrin and that the presence of the catalytic domain and/or the linker glycopeptide stabilises the binding domain.",

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of the acid proteinase from Aspergillus saitoi was studied by CD and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This process seemed to be completely irreversible, as protein samples that were heated to temperatures at which the transition had been completed and then cooled at 25 degrees C did not show any reversal of the change in the CD signal. Similar results were obtained with DSC. Nevertheless, we were able to detect the presence of reversibly unfolded species in experiments in which the enzyme solution was heated to a temperature within the transition region, followed by rapid cooling at 25 degrees C. Accordingly, the denaturation of behaviour of the acid proteinase seems to be consistent with the existence of one (or more) reversible unfolding transition followed by an irreversible step. The van't Hoff enthalpy, delta HvH, which corresponds to the reversible transition was calculated from extrapolation to infinite heating rate as 310 kJ.mol-1. This parameter was also determined from direct estimation of the equilibrium constant at several temperatures (delta HvH = 176 kJ.mol-1). Comparison of the average delta HvH with the calorimetric enthalpy (delta Hcal. = 770 kJ.mol-1) gave a value of 3.2 for the delta Hcal./delta HvH ratio, indicating that the molecular structure of the enzyme is probably formed by three or four cooperative regions, a number similar to that of the acid proteinase, pepsin. It should be noted that a completely different conclusion would be obtained from a straightforward analysis of the calorimetric curves, disregarding the effect of irreversibility on the denaturation process.",

In the latter medium, the native membrane shows the main transition at 97 degrees C, with an enthalpy of 390 kJ/mol. The reduced form of the purple membrane shows two small transitions in water, as well as in 0.1 M phosphate, which do not seem to be related to the main thermal transition of the native membrane. Fourier-transform infrared spectra in D2O show that the two modified samples, as well as the native one, undergo similar secondary structural changes upon thermal denaturation. These changes appear to extend through a wide temperature range for both modified forms, particularly for the bleached one. The results suggest that the main thermal transition in the purple membrane is due to a cooperative conformational change involving the disruption of the network of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions which originate from the protonated Schiff base. In the two modified membranes, these conformational changes appear to proceed smoothly through a rather low or non-cooperative process. The thermal behaviour of the bleached membrane in water resembles that of the molten globule state described for several globular proteins.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fibril assembly is a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Fibril formation is a complex nucleation-dependent polymerization process characterized in vitro by an initial lag phase. To a significant degree, this phase is a consequence of the energy barrier that must be overcome in order for Abeta monomers to fold and oligomerize into fibril nuclei. Here we show that low concentrations of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) convert predominately unstructured Abeta monomers into partially ordered, quasistable conformers. Surprisingly, this results in a temporal decrease in the lag phase for fibril formation and a significant increase in the rate of fibril elongation. The TFE effect is concentration dependent and is maximal at approximately 20% (v/v). In the presence of low concentrations of TFE, fibril formation is observed in Abeta samples at nanomolar concentration, well below the critical concentration for Abeta fibril formation in the absence of TFE. As the amount of TFE is increased above 20%, helix content progressively rises to approximately 80%, a change paralleled first by a decrease in elongation rate and then by a complete cessation of fibril growth. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a partially folded helix-containing conformer is an intermediate in Abeta fibril assembly. The requirement that Abeta partially folds in order to assemble into fibrils contrasts with the mechanism of amyloidogenesis of natively folded proteins such as transthyretin and lysozyme, in which partial unfolding is a prerequisite. Our results suggest that in vivo, factors that affect helix formation and stability will have significant effects on the kinetics of Abeta fibril formation.",

Kinetic analysis of the variants with stability similar to that of the wild type protein shows accelerated unfolding and refolding rates compatible with a preferential stabilization of the transition state. This is most likely caused by conformational strain in the native state, as deletion of a methyl group (Ile-->Val) leads to deceleration in unfolding and increased stability (up to 2 kcal x mol(-1)). Several of these Ile-->Val mutants have negative phi(-U) values, indicating that some noncanonical phi(-U) values might result from conformational strain. Thus, producing a stable protein does not necessarily mean that the design process has been entirely successful.

        "abstract": "It was previously shown that the two replacements Gly 77-->Ala (G77A) and Ala 82-->Pro (A82P) increase the thermostability of phage T4 lysozyme at pH 6.5. Such replacements are presumed to restrict the degrees of freedom of the unfolded protein and so decrease the entropy of unfolding [B. W. Matthews, H. Nicholson, and W. J. Becktel (1987) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA Vol. 84, pp. 6663-6667]. To further test this approach, three additional replacements--G113A, K60P and A93P--have been constructed. On the basis of model building, each of these three replacements was judged to be less than optimal because it would tend to introduce unfavorable van der Waals contacts with neighboring parts of the protein. The presence of such contacts was verified for G113A and K60P by conformational adjustments seen in the crystal structures of these mutant proteins. In the case of G113A there are backbone conformational changes of 0.5-1.0 A in the short alpha-helix, 108-113, that includes the site of substitution. In the case of K60P the pyrrolidine ring shows evidence of strain. The thermal stability of each of the three variants at both pH 2.0 and pH 6.5 was found to be very close to that of wild-type lysozyme. The results suggest that the procedure used to predict sites for both Xaa-->Pro and Gly-->Ala is, in principle, correct. At the same time, the increase in stability expected from substitutions of this type is modest, and can easily be offset by strain associated with introduction of the alanine or proline. This means that the criteria used to select substitutions that will increase thermostability have to be stringent at least. In the case of T4 lysozyme this severely limits the number of sites. The analysis reveals a significant discrepancy between the conformational energy surface predicted for the residue preceding a proline and the conformations observed in crystal structures.",

        "abstract": "The substitution of methionines with leucines within the interior of a protein is expected to increase stability both because of a more favorable solvent transfer term as well as the reduced entropic cost of holding a leucine side chain in a defined position. Together, these two terms are expected to contribute about 1.4 kcal/mol to protein stability for each Met --> Leu substitution when fully buried. At the same time, this expected beneficial effect may be offset by steric factors due to differences in the shape of leucine and methionine. To investigate the interplay between these factors, all methionines in T4 lysozyme except at the amino-terminus were individually replaced with leucine. Of these mutants, M106L and M120L have stabilities 0.5 kcal/mol higher than wild-type T4 lysozyme, while M6L is significantly destabilized (-2.8 kcal/mol). M102L, described previously, is also destabilized (-0.9 kcal/mol). Based on this limited sample it appears that methionine-to-leucine substitutions can increase protein stability but only in a situation where the methionine side chain is fully or partially buried, yet allows the introduction of the leucine without concomitant steric interference. The variants, together with methionine-to-lysine substitutions at the same sites, follow the general pattern that substitutions at rigid, internal sites tend to be most destabilizing, whereas replacements at more solvent-exposed sites are better tolerated.",

In equilibrium condition at pH 2.2, hen lysozyme shows a single cooperative transition in the GdnCl-induced unfolding experiment. However, in the GdnCl-induced unfolding process at lower pH 0.9, a distinct intermediate state with molten globule characteristics was observed. The time-dependent unfolding and refolding of the protein were induced by concentration jumps of the denaturant and measured by using stopped-flow circular dichroism at pH 2.2. Immediately after the dilution of denaturant, the kinetics of refolding shows evidence of a major unresolved far-UV CD change during the dead time (<10 ms) of the stopped-flow experiment (burst phase). The observed refolding and unfolding curves were both fitted well to a single-exponential function, and the rate constants obtained in the far- and near-UV regions coincided with each other. The dependence on denaturant concentration of amplitudes of burst phase and both rate constants was modeled quantitatively by a sequential three-state mechanism, U<-->I<-->N, in which the burst-phase intermediate (I) in rapid equilibrium with the unfolded state (U) precedes the rate-determining formation of the native state (N).

Addition of kosmotropic salts, chloride, tartrate, sulfate, phosphate, and citrate (0.2 M) decreased the heat-induced exposure of the thiol group (at 70 degrees), probably by decreasing the dissociation of the dimer at pH 6.85. The relative change in free energy of activation for the dissociation of the dimer, delta(delta G++dimer), in the presence of the salts was positive, suggesting that these additives increase the stability of the dimer against heat. These salts also increased the conformational stability of beta-lactoglobulin as revealed by an increase in -delta(delta G0conf) values in their presence. Both delta(delta G++dimer) and -delta(delta G0conf) values followed the order, chloride less than tartrate less than sulfate less than phosphate less than citrate.

Here we show that an amino acid substitution (T29I) increases the native-state stability of goat alpha-lactalbumin against the guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding by 3.5 kcal/mol. Kinetic refolding and unfolding of wild-type and mutant goat alpha-lactalbumin measured by stopped-flow circular dichroism showed that the local structure around the Thr29 side chain was not constructed in the transition state of the folding reaction. To characterize the local structural change around the Thr29 side chain to an atomic level of resolution, we performed high-temperature (at 400 K and 600 K) molecular dynamics simulations and studied the structural change at an initial stage of unfolding observed in the simulation trajectories. The Thr29 portion of the molecule experienced structural disruption accompanied with the loss of inter-residue contacts and with the water molecule penetration in the 400-K simulation as well as in four of the six 600-K simulations. Disruption of the N-terminal portion was also observed and was consistent with the results of kinetic refolding/unfolding experiments shown in our previous report.",

        "abstract": "The reversible denaturation of protein disulfide isomerase proceeds through intermediates that are stabilized by interaction with guanidine hydrochloride. At pH 7.5, the equilibrium denaturation by urea is completely reversible and the transition can be reasonably well-described by a two-state model involving only native and denatured forms. In comparison, the equilibrium denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride occurs in two distinct steps. In the presence of a low constant amount of guanidine hydrochloride (0.5-1.4 M), urea denaturation also becomes biphasic, suggesting the accumulation of an intermediate species that is stabilized by specific interaction with guanidine hydrochloride but not by high concentrations of other salts or other denaturants.",

        "abstract": "The betagamma-crystallin superfamily consists of a class of homologous two-domain proteins with Greek-key fold. Protein S, a Ca(2+)-binding spore-coat protein from the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus exhibits a high degree of sequential and structural homology with gammaB-crystallin from the vertebrate eye lens. In contrast to gammaB-crystallin, which undergoes irreversible aggregation upon thermal unfolding, protein S folds reversibly and may therefore serve as a model in the investigation of the thermodynamic stability of the eye-lens crystallins. The thermal denaturation of recombinant protein S (PS) and its isolated domains was studied by differential scanning calorimetry in the absence and in the presence of Ca(2+) at varying pH. Ca(2+)-binding leads to a stabilization of PS and its domains and increases the cooperativity of their equilibrium unfolding transitions. The isolated N-terminal and C-terminal domains (NPS and CPS) obey the two-state model, independent of the pH and Ca(2+)-binding; in the case of PS, under all conditions, an equilibrium intermediate is populated. The first transition of PS may be assigned to the denaturation of the C-terminal domain and the loss of domain interactions, whereas the second one coincides with the denaturation of the isolated N-terminal domain. At pH 7.0, in the presence of Ca(2+), where PS exhibits maximal stability, the domain interactions at 20 degrees C contribute 20 kJ/mol to the overall stability of the intact protein.",

        "abstract": "In order to correlate between spectroscopic and structural changes in a protein, the environment of Trp 135 in T4 lysozyme was deliberately perturbed by the replacement of Gln 105 with alanine (Q105A), glycine (Q105G), and glutamic acid (Q105E). In wild-type lysozyme, Trp 135 is buried, but the indole nitrogen is hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain of Gln 105. In the Q105G and Q105A mutant structures, the indole nitrogen becomes accessible to solvent. Crystallographic analysis shows that the structures of all of the mutants are similar to wild-type. There are, however, distinct rearrangements of the local solvent structure in response to the new side-chains. There are also small but significant changes in the relative orientations of the two domains of the protein that appear to result from a series of small, concerted movements of side-chains adjacent to residue 105. Evaluation of the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the mutant proteins in terms of their observed three-dimensional structures shows that large spectral changes do not necessarily imply large changes in structure or in static solvent accessibility. Increases in polar relaxation about the excited state of tryptophan may be the result of only small increases in local dynamics or solvent exposure. 1H-NMR was also used to monitor the effects of the substitutions on Trp 138. In Q105E, but not in Q105G, Q105A and WT, the H epsilon chemical shift of Trp 138 is very pH-dependent, apparently reflecting the titration of Glu 105 which has a spectroscopically determined pKa of 6.0. The elevation of the pKa of Glu 105 in Q105E is also reflected in the pH dependence of the stability of this mutant.",

        "abstract": "We have made multiple replacements (alanine, arginine, cysteine, histidine, isoleucine, serine, tyrosine) of valine-75 in dihydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli to examine the relative importance to protein folding of the position that is substituted and the specific character of the amino acid replacement. Valine-75 is part of the eight-stranded beta sheet that forms the structural core of the protein. The isopropyl side chain participates in van der Waals interactions with a number of nonpolar residues, helping to establish a large hydrophobic cluster. Equilibrium studies showed that arginine, histidine, isoleucine, serine, and tyrosine destabilize the protein by 1.9-2.8 kcal mol-1. Alanine and cysteine substitutions have little or no effect. Contrary to other recent studies of the effect of multiple replacements at a hydrophobic site, there is no observed correlation between the changes of the free energy of folding and the changes of the free energy of transfer for the individual amino acids from water to an organic solvent when they are inserted into this site. The effects observed in kinetic studies are both consistent with and extend the equilibrium results; these data indicate that position 75 participates in a rate-limiting step of folding. Some of the equilibrium and kinetic properties of the tyrosine-75 mutant deviated significantly from those of wild-type protein and the other mutants at position 75. (1) The tyrosine variant displayed a complex banding pattern when analyzed by native gel electrophoresis; the wild-type protein and all other mutants at position 75 migrated as single, discrete bands. (2) Comparison of the difference ultraviolet and circular dichroism transition curves showed that a third species is populated at equilibrium; the wild-type protein and all other mutants at position 75 follow a two-state model involving only native and unfolded forms. (3) A third kinetic phase appeared in the unfolding reaction; the wild-type protein and all other mutants at position 75 only showed two kinetic phases in unfolding. Properties 1 and 3 suggest that the tyrosine mutation significantly alters the distribution of native conformers in the protein. These effects on the equilibrium and kinetic data readily display an overriding pattern: residues that would require hydrogen bonding or lead to an expansion of the tightly packed hydrophobic environment in which valine-75 resides destabilize the protein and alter relaxation times of kinetic phases in a consistent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The thermal stability of the core histone dimer H2A-H2B has been studied by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The unfolding transition temperature of the 28 kDa H2A-H2B dimer increases as a function of both the ionic strength of the solvent and the total protein concentration. At neutral pH and physiological ionic strength, the thermal denaturation is centered at about 50 degrees C with a corresponding enthalpy change of about 40 kcal/mol of 14 kDa monomer unit and an excess heat capacity of about 1.4 kcal/(K.mol) of 14 kDa monomer unit. The H2A-H2B dimer is stable mainly between pH 5.5 and 10.5. Below pH 4.0, the system is unfolded at all temperatures. The thermodynamic analysis is performed at low ionic strength where almost complete reversibility is attained, since higher salt conditions seem to promote aggregation and irreversibility of the transitions. Analysis of the data shows that at low ionic strength and pH values between 6.5 and 8.5, the H2A-H2B dimer behaves as a highly cooperative system, melting as a single unit without any detectable intermediates of dissociated, yet folded, H2A and H2B monomers. This is consistent with the observed protein concentration dependence of the midpoint of the thermal denaturation. The two-state unfolding process can be described by the general scheme AB-->2U, indicating that the individual H2A and H2B polypeptides are folded, stable entities only when complexed as the H2A-H2B dimer and that the major contribution to the stabilization of the dimer derives from the coupling between the H2A and H2B interfaces.",

The presence of two Trp residues (Trp56 and Trp77) allows the monitoring of fluorescence quenching on refolding in two different regions of the protein. A single His residue (the iron-coordinating His16) permits the study of refolding in the absence of miscoordination events. After identification of the kinetic traps (Pro isomerization and aggregation of denatured protein), overall refolding kinetics is described by two processes: (i) a burstphase collapse (faster than milliseconds) which we show to be a global event leading to a state whose compactness depends on the overall net charge; at the isoeletric pH (4.7), it is maximally compact, while above and below it is more expanded; and (ii) an exponential phase (in the millisecond time range) leading to the native protein via a transition state(s) possibly involving the formation of a specific salt bridge between Lys10 and Glu70, at the contact between the N and C-terminal helices. Comparison with the widely studied horse cytochrome c allows the discussion of similarities and differences in the folding of two proteins which have the same \"fold\" despite a very low degree of sequence homology (<30 %).",

The recombinant protein was purified by heat-treatment and gel-filtration. The protein was crystallized in the cubic space group I23 with the cell dimensions a = b = c = 180.8 A, and diffraction data were collected to 1.6 A resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using lumazine synthase from Bacillus subtilis as search model. The structure of the A. aeolicus enzyme was refined to a resolution of 1.6 A. The spherical protein consists of 60 identical subunits with strict icosahedral 532 symmetry. The subunit fold is closely related to that of the B. subtilis enzyme (rmsd 0.80 A). The extremely thermostable lumazine synthase from A. aeolicus has a melting temperature of 119.9 degrees C. Compared to other icosahedral and pentameric lumazine synthases, the A. aeolicus enzyme has the largest accessible surface presented by charged residues and the smallest surface presented by hydrophobic residues. It also has the largest number of ion-pairs per subunit. Two ion-pair networks involving two, respectively three, stacking arginine residues assume a distinct role in linking adjacent subunits.

The mutants were less stable than the wild type, indicating that Cys residues contribute greatly to the stability of the alpha subunit. In most cases, a large decrease in denaturation enthalpy was observed, compensated for by the denaturation entropy to a major extent. The extent of changes in the denaturation Gibbs energy and denaturation enthalpy varied greatly depending on both substituting residues and positions. Of all the mutant proteins, the Cys154Ser mutant showed the greatest decrease in denaturation enthalpy; its denaturation enthalpy was half that of the wild type, and was considerably repaired by adding a ligand of the alpha subunit. Because the enthalpy of ligand binding to Cys154Ser in the native state did not change, it seems that the decrease in the denaturation enthalpy of Cys154Ser and its recovery by ligand binding are caused by conformational changes in the denatured state due to the mutation.",

At pH 3.0 and 57 degrees C, the stabilities of both the C77A and C77/95A mutants were decreased about 4.6 kcal.mol-1 in Gibbs free energy change. Under the same conditions, the enthalpy changes (delta H) were 94.8 and 90.8 kcal.mol-1, respectively, which were smaller than that of the wild type (100.8 kcal.mol-1). The destabilization of the mutants was caused by enthalpic factors. Although X-ray crystallography indicated that the mutants preserve the wild-type tertiary structure, removal of the disulfide bridge increased the flexibility of the native state of the mutants. This was indicated both by an increase in the crystallographic thermal factors (B-factors) and by a decrease in the affinity of N-acetylglucosamine trimer [(NAG)3] observed using isothermal titration calorimetry (DTC) due to entropic effects. Thus, the effect of cross-linking on the stability of a protein is not solely explained by the entropy change in denaturation.",

Partial thermal or chemical denaturation, or treatment with trifluoroethanol, readily activated dimeric DmpM. A combination of circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies, activity assays, and native and urea gel electrophoresis were used to further characterize reactivation with urea.

This phenomenon implicates structural changes that expose FN binding sites and activate the protein to promote intermolecular interactions with other FN. We have investigated, using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, the unfolding process of human fibronectin induced by urea in different ionic strength conditions. At any ionic strength, the equilibrium unfolding data are well described by a four-state equilibrium model N <= => I(1) <= =>I(2) <= => U. Fitting this model to experimental values, we have determined the free energy change for the different steps. We found that the N <= => I(1) transition corresponds to a free energy of 10.5 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol. Comparable values of free energy change are generally associated with a partial unfolding of the type III domain. For the I(1) <= => I(2) transition, the free energy change is 7.6 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol at low ionic strength but is twice as low at high ionic strength. This result is consistent with observations indicating that the complete unfolding of the type III domain from partially unfolded forms necessitates about 5 kcal/mol. The third step, I(2) <= => U, which leads to the complete unfolding of fibronectin, corresponds to a free energy change of 14.4 +/- 0.9 kcal/mol at low ionic strength whereas this energy is again twice as low under high ionic strength conditions. This hierarchical unfolding of fibronectin, as well as the stability of the different intermediates controlled by ionic strength demonstrated here, could be important for the understanding of activation of the matrix assembly.",

To examine the effect of the arrangement of these hydrophobic residues, mutant proteins were further constructed: 12 sites out of the 18 Leu, 9 Ile, and 8 Val residues of the wild-type myoglobin were randomly replaced with each other so that the amino acid compositions were similar to that of the wild-type protein. Four mutant proteins were obtained without selection of the protein properties. These residue replacements similarly resulted in the stabilization of both the intermediate and folded states against the unfolded states, as compared to the wild-type protein. Thus, the arrangements of the hydrophobic residues in the native amino acid sequence are selected to destabilize the folding intermediate rather than to stabilize the folded state. The present results suggest that the two-state transition of protein folding or the transient formation of the unstable intermediate, which seems to be required for effective production of the functional proteins, has been a major driving force in the molecular evolution of natural globular proteins.",

        "abstract": "The thermostability properties of TAA were investigated by chemically modifying carboxyl groups on the surface of the enzyme with AMEs. The TAA(MOD) exhibited a 200% improvement in starch-hydrolyzing productivity at 60 degrees C. By studying the kinetic, thermodynamic and biophysical properties, we found that TAA(MOD) had formed a thermostable, MG state, in which the unfolding of the tertiary structure preceded that of the secondary structure by at least 20 degrees C. The X-ray crystal structure of TAA(MOD) revealed no new permanent interactions (electrostatic or other) resulting from the modification. By deriving thermodynamic activation parameters of TAA(MOD), we rationalised that thermostabilisation have been caused by a decrease in the entropy of the transition state, rather than being enthalpically driven. Far-UV CD shows that the origin of decreased entropy may have arisen from a higher helical content of TAA(MOD). This study provides new insight into the intriguing properties of an MG state resulting from the chemical modification of TAA.",

In order to understand the misfolding process, it is necessary to examine the folding of alpha1-antitrypsin through the different structures involved in this process. In this study we have used a novel technique in which unique cysteine residues were introduced at various positions into alpha1-antitrypsin and fluorescently labeled with N, N'-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine. The fluorescence properties of each protein were studied in the native state and as a function of guanidine hydrochloride-mediated unfolding. The studies found that alpha1-antitrypsin unfolded through a series of intermediate structures. From the position of the fluorescence probes, the fluorescence quenching data, and the molecular modeling, we show that unfolding of alpha1-antitrypsin occurs via disruption of the A and C beta-sheets followed by the B beta-sheet. The implications of these data on both alpha1-antitrypsin function and polymerization are discussed.",

Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy show that SFA-8 is highly stable to denaturation by heating or chaotropic agents, the latter resulting in a reversible two-state unfolding transition. The small m(U) (-4.7 M(-1) at 10 degrees C) and DeltaC(p) (-0.95 kcal mol(-1) K(-1)) values indicate that relatively little nonpolar surface of the protein is exposed during unfolding. Commensurate with the unusual distribution of hydrophobic residues, stopped-flow fluorescence data show that the folding pathway of SFA-8 is highly atypical, in that the initial product of the rapid collapse phase of folding is a compact nonnative state (or collection of nonnative states) that must unfold before acquiring the native conformation. The inhibited folding reaction of SFA-8, in which the misfolded state (m(M) = -0.95 M(-1) at 10 degrees C) is more compact than the transition state for folding (m(T) = -2.5 M(-1) at 10 degrees C), provides direct kinetic evidence for the transient misfolding of a protein.",

This fragment exhibits a single reversible melting transition near 64 degrees C in TBS buffer (0.02 M-Tris buffer containing 0.15 M-NaCl, pH 7.4). The transition is characterized by a calorimetric to van't Hoff enthalpy ratio of 1.6, suggesting a complex domain structure. A 30 kDa fragment with the same NH2 terminus (I6-II1-II2-I7) melts reversibly near 65 degrees C with delta Hcal/delta HvH = 1.3, also consistent with the presence of more than one domain. To elucidate further the domain structure, three non-overlapping subfragments were prepared and characterized with respect to their unfolding induced by heat and guanidinium chloride. The three subfragments, each containing two modules, are designated from amino or carboxyl-terminal location as 13 kDa (I6-II1) 16 kDa (II2-I7) and 21 kDa (I8-I9) according to their apparent Mr in SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All three subfragments exhibited reversible transitions in TBS buffer, behaving in the calorimeter as single co-operative units with delta Hcal/delta HvH close to unity. However, the specific enthalpies and changes in heat capacity associated with the melting of all fragments and subfragments in TBS buffer were low compared to those of most compact globular proteins, suggesting that not all modules are represented. When titrated with guanidinium chloride at 25 degrees C, all fragments exhibited monophasic reversible unfolding transitions detected by changes in fluorescence. Heating in the presence of 6 M-guanidinium chloride revealed three additional transitions not seen in the absence of denaturants. These transitions have been assigned to three of the four type I finger modules (I6, I7 and I9), one of which (I6) was isolated and shown to retain a compact structure as stable as that observed for this module within the parent fragments. Two other modules (II2 and I7) are destabilized when separated from their neighbors. Thus, despite their small size (50 to 60 amino acid residues), all six of the modules in the gelatin-binding region of fibronectin form independently folded domains, three of which (I6, I7 and I9) are unusually stable. Evidence is provided that four of the six modules interact with each other in the parent fragment. This interaction may explain previously noted disruptions in the otherwise uniform strand-like images seen in electron micrographs of fibronectin.",

        "abstract": "The effect of trehalose on folding and stability of the small ribosomal protein S6 was studied. Non-disruptive point mutations distributed along the protein structure were analyzed to characterize the stabilizing effect of trehalose and map the folding pathway of S6. On average, the stability of the wild-type and S6 mutants increases by 3 kcal/mol M trehalose. Despite the non-specific thermodynamic stabilization mechanism, trehalose particularly stabilizes the less destabilized mutants. Folding/unfolding kinetics shows clearly that trehalose induces the collapse of the unfolded state to an off-pathway intermediate with non-native diffuse contacts. This state is similar to the collapsed state induced by high concentrations of stabilizing salts, as previously reported. Although it leads to the accumulation of this off-pathway intermediate, trehalose does not change the compactness of the transition state ensemble. Furthermore, the productive folding pathway of S6 is not affected by trehalose as shown by a Phi-value analysis. The unfolded state ensemble of S6 should be more compact in the presence of trehalose and therefore destabilized due to decreased conformational entropy. Increased compaction of the unfolded state ensemble might also occur for more stable mutants of S6, thus explaining the synergistic effect of trehalose and point mutations on protein stabilization.",

To distinguish the two possibilities, the submillisecond folding dynamics of ribonuclease A (RNase A) was examined, and compared with those of the disulfide bond-ruptured analog of RNase A (r-RNase A). The circular dichroism measurements on RNase A showed the burst-phase signal within 320 micros after the initiation of the folding reaction, which was identical to that observed for r-RNase A. In contrast, the burst phase increase in the extrinsic fluorescence from 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) was observed for RNase A but not for r-RNase A. The kinetic titration experiment of the ANS fluorescence intensity showed the presence of a specific binding site for ANS in the fast-refolding component of RNase A. The small-angle X-ray scattering measurements at approximately 22 ms after initiating the folding reaction demonstrated that the burst phase conformations of the medium and slow-refolding components of RNase A were distinctly smaller than that of r-RNase A. These results indicated the difference in the burst phase conformations of RNase A and r-RNase A. Since r-RNase A is denatured in the physiological solution condition, the burst-phase signal of RNase A was interpreted as the formation of the folding intermediate with specific conformations.",

        "abstract": "The nature of the rate-limiting transition state at zero denaturant (TS(1)) and whether there are hidden intermediates are the two major unsolved problems in defining the folding pathway of barnase. In earlier studies, it was shown that TS(1) has small phi values throughout the structure of the protein, suggesting that the transition state has either a defined partially folded secondary structure with all side chains significantly exposed or numerous different partially unfolded structures with similar stability. To distinguish the two possibilities, we studied the effect of Gly mutations on the folding rate of barnase to investigate the secondary structure formation in the transition state. Two mutations in the same region of a beta-strand decreased the folding rate by 20- and 50-fold, respectively, suggesting that the secondary structures in this region are dominantly formed in the rate-limiting transition state. We also performed native-state hydrogen exchange experiments on barnase at pD 5.0 and 25 degrees C and identified a partially unfolded state. The structure of the intermediate was investigated using protein engineering and NMR. The results suggest that the intermediate has an omega loop unfolded. This intermediate is more folded than the rate-limiting transition state previously characterized at high denaturant concentrations (TS(2)). Therefore, it exists after TS(2) in folding. Consistent with this conclusion, the intermediate folds with the same rate and denaturant dependence as the wild-type protein, but unfolds faster with less dependence on the denaturant concentration. These and other results in the literature suggest that barnase folds through partially unfolded intermediates that exist after the rate-limiting step. Such folding behavior is similar to those of cytochrome c and Rd-apocyt b(562). Together, we suggest that other small apparently two-state proteins may also fold through hidden intermediates.",

        "abstract": "As a test of the hypothesis that folding mechanisms are better conserved than sequences in TIM barrels, the equilibrium and kinetic folding mechanisms of indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (sIGPS) from the thermoacidophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus were compared to the well-characterized models of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase (alphaTS) from Escherichia coli. A multifaceted approach combining urea denaturation and far-UV circular dichroism, tyrosine fluorescence total intensity, and tyrosine fluorescence anisotropy was employed. Despite a sequence identity of only 13%, a stable intermediate (I) in sIGPS was found to be similar to a stable intermediate in alphaTS in terms of its thermodynamic properties and secondary structure. Kinetic experiments revealed that the fastest detectable folding event for sIGPS involves a burst-phase (<5ms) reaction that leads directly to the stable intermediate. The slower of two subsequent phases reflects the formation/disruption of an off-pathway dimeric form of I. The faster phase reflects the conversion of I to the native state and is limited by folding under marginally stable conditions and by isomerization or rearrangement under strongly folding conditions. By contrast, alphaTS is thought to fold via an off-pathway burst-phase intermediate whose unfolding controls access to a set of four on-pathway intermediates that comprise the stable equilibrium intermediate. At least three proline isomerization reactions are known to limit their interconversions and lead to a parallel channel mechanism. The simple sequential mechanism deduced for sIGPS reflects the dominance of the on-pathway burst-phase intermediate and the absence of prolyl residues that partition the stable intermediate into kinetically distinguishable species. Comparison of the results for sIGPS and alphaTS demonstrates that the thermodynamic properties and the final steps of the folding reaction are better conserved than the early events. The initial events in folding appear to be more sensitive to the sequence differences between the two TIM barrel proteins.",

        "abstract": "We have examined the properties and interactions of expressed polypeptide fragments from the N-terminus of the alpha-chain and the C-terminus of the beta-chain of human erythroid spectrin. Each polypeptide comprises one complete structural repeating unit, together with the incomplete repeat that interacts with its partner when spectrin tetramers are formed. The shared repeat thus generated is made up of two helices from the C-terminal part of the beta-chain and one helix from the N-terminus of the alpha-chain. Three mutant beta-chain fragments with amino acid substitutions in the incomplete terminal repeat were also studied. The alpha- and beta-chain fragments were both substantially monomeric, as shown by sedimentation equilibrium. Circular dichroism analysis and thermal denaturation profiles revealed that the complete repeat present in each fragment had entered the stable tertiary fold. Unexpectedly, the conformational stability of the folded beta-chain repeat was found to be grossly perturbed by the mutations, all of them well beyond its C-terminal boundary; possible explanations for this phenomenon are considered. Sedimentation equilibrium showed that in equimolar mixtures the wildtype alpha- and beta-chain peptides formed a 1:1 complex. Mixing curves, observed by circular dichroism, revealed that association was accompanied by an increase in alpha-helicity. From continuous-variation profiles an association constant in the range 1-2 x 10(6) M-1 was inferred. The association was unaffected by the apparently unstructured anionic tail of 54 residues, found at the C-terminus of the spectrin beta-chain. Of the three mutations in the beta-chain fragment, one (an Ala-->Val replacement in the A helix segment of the incomplete repeat) had a relatively small effect on the association with the alpha-chain fragment, whereas Trp-->Arg mutations in the A and in the remote B helix segments were much more deleterious. These observations are consistent with the relative severities of the haemolytic conditions associated with the mutations.",

At lower temperatures the mutant polypeptide chains fold and associate into native proteins. The melting temperatures of the purified native forms of seven different tsf mutant proteins have been determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Under conditions in which the wild type protein had a melting temperature of 88.4 degrees C, the melting temperatures of the mutant proteins were all above 82 degrees C, more than 40 degrees C higher than the temperature for expression of the folding defect. Because the folding defects were observed in vivo, the thermostability of the native protein was also examined with infected cells. Once matured at 28 degrees C, intracellular tsf mutant tailspikes remained native when the cells were transferred to 42 degrees C, a temperature that prevents newly synthesized tsf chains from folding correctly. These results confirm that the failure of tsf polypeptide chains to reach their native state is not due to a lowered stability of the native state. Such mutants differ from the class of ts mutations which render the native state thermolabile. The intracellular folding defects must reflect decreased stabilities of folding intermediates or alteration in the off-pathway steps leading to aggregation and inclusion body formation. These results indicate that the stability of a native protein within the cells is not sufficient to insure the successful folding of the newly synthesized chains into the native state.",

The acid stabilization of insulin's conformation was attributed to the protonation of histidine at position 5 on the B-chain (HB5) as determined by 1H-NMR of the histidines, selective amino acid alteration, and enthalpies of ionization. Further acidification (at least to pH 2) does not decrease the free energy of unfolding. A conformational change in the tertiary structure, as indicated by the near-UV circular dichroism spectrum, accompanies this change in stability.

In this work, catalytic activity and fluorescence measurements were used to study the effect of viscosity in the unfolding and refolding of the homodimeric enzyme triosephosphate isomerase from Saccharamyces cerevisiae. Two transitions were found by equilibrium and kinetic experiments, suggesting a three-state model with a monomeric intermediate. Glycerol barely affects DeltaG(0)(fold) whereas DeltaG(0)(assoc) becomes more favourable in the presence of the cosolvent. From 0 to 60% (v/v) glycerol, the association rate constant showed a near unitary dependence on solvent viscosity. However, at higher glycerol concentrations deviations from Kramers theory were observed. The dissociation rate constant showed a viscosity effect much higher than one. This may be related to secondary effects such as short-range glycerol-induced repulsion between monomers. Nevertheless, after comparison under isostability conditions, a slope near one was also observed for the dissociation rate. These results strongly suggest that the bimolecular association producing the native dimer is limited by diffusional events of the polypeptide chains through the solvent.",

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) regulates the expression of a large number of catabolite-sensitive genes. The mechanism of CRP regulation most likely involves communication between subunits and domains. A specific message, such as the activation of CRP, may be manifested as a change in the interactions between these structural entities. Hence, the elucidation of the regulatory mechanism would require a quantitative evaluation of the energetics involved in these interactions. Thus, a study was initiated to define the conditions for reversible denaturation of CRP and to quantitatively assess the energetics involved in the intra- and intersubunit interactions in CRP. The denaturation of CRP was induced by guanidine hydrochloride. The equilibrium unfolding reaction of CRP was monitored by three spectroscopic techniques, namely, fluorescence intensity, fluorescence anisotropy, and circular dichroism. The spectroscopic data implied that CRP unfolds in a single cooperative transition. Sedimentation equilibrium data showed that CRP is dissociated into its monomeric state in high concentrations of denaturant. Unfolding of CRP is completely reversible, as indicated by fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements, and sedimentation data indicated that a dimeric structure of CRP was recovered. The functional and other structural properties of renatured and native CRP have also been examined. Quantitatively identical results were obtained. Results from additional studies as a function of protein concentration and from computer simulation demonstrated that the denaturation of CRP induced by guanidine hydrochloride proceeds according to the following pathway: (CRP2)Native<-->2(CRP)Native<-->2(CRP)Denatured. The delta G values for dissociation (delta Gd) and unfolding (delta G(u)) in the absence of guanidine hydrochloride were determined by linear extrapolation, yielding values of 12.0 +/- 0.6 and 7.2 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol, respectively. To examine the effect of the DNA binding domain on the stability of the cAMP binding domain, two proteolytically resistant cAMP binding cores were prepared from CRP in the presence of cAMP by subtilisin and chymotrypsin digestion, yielding S-CRP and CH-CRP, respectively. Results from an equilibrium denaturation study indicated that the denaturation of both CH-CRP and S-CRP is also completely reversible. Both S-CRP and CH-CRP exist as stable dimers with similar delta Gd values of 10.1 +/- 0.4 and 9.5 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Results from this study in conjunction with crystallographic data [McKay, D. B., Weber, I. T., & Stietz, T. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9518-9524] indicate that the DNA binding domain and the C-helix are not the only structural elements that are responsible for subunit dimerization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The structural stability of the integral membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans has been measured by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Contrary to the mammalian enzyme or the yeast enzyme, which are composed of 13 subunits, the bacterial enzyme has only three or four subunits, thus providing a unique opportunity to examine the magnitude of the forces that stabilize this enzyme and to establish accurate structural assignments of events observed calorimetrically. In this paper, experiments have been performed with the wild-type enzyme and with a mutant enzyme lacking subunit III. Our results show that subunits I and II form a highly cooperative complex which denatures as a single cooperative unit at 67 degrees C, while subunit III is less stable and denatures 20 degrees C earlier. Reduction of the enzyme causes a large increase in the stability of subunits I and II but has absolutely no effect on subunit III. Despite the lack of a strong interaction between subunit III and the catalytic subunits, the absence of subunit III leads to a turnover-induced loss of electron-transfer activity. The magnitude of the energetic parameters and the infrared spectroscopic experiments indicate that the enzyme does not completely unfold upon thermal denaturation and that significant degrees of structure are preserved. The amount of native alpha-helix structure, which is 45% in the native state, decreases only to 30% after thermal denaturation. Presumably, the residual helical structure existing after thermal denaturation belongs to the intramembranous portions of the protein. The calorimetric behavior of subunit III does not fully conform to that expected for a highly alpha-helical membrane protein. The picture that emerges from these experiments is that, in the temperature-denatured form of the enzyme, most of the extramembranous structural elements are denatured while most of the intramembranous secondary structure is maintained even though native tertiary interactions appear to be disrupted.",

        "abstract": "Dimers of CH3 domains from human IgG1 were used to study the effect of mutations constructed at a domain-domain interface upon domain dissociation and unfolding, \"complex stability\". Alanine replacement mutants were constructed on one side of the interface for each of the sixteen interdomain contact residues by using a single-chain CH3 dimer in which the carboxyl terminus of one domain was joined to the amino terminus of the second domain via a (G4S)4 linker. Single-chain variants were expressed in Escherichia coli grown in a fermentor and recovered in yields of 6-90 mg L-1 by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation was used to follow domain dissociation and unfolding. Surprisingly, the linker did not perturb the complex stability for either the wild type or two destabilizing mutants. The CH3 domain dissociation and unfolding energetics are dominated by six contact residues where corresponding alanine mutations each destabilize the complex by >2.0 kcal mol-1. Five of these residues (T366, L368, F405, Y407, and K409) form a patch at the center of the interface and are located on the two internal antiparallel beta-strands. These energetically key residues are surrounded by 10 residues on the two external beta-strands whose contribution to complex stability is small (three have a Delta DeltaG of 1.1-1.3 kcal mol-1) or very small (seven have a Delta DeltaG of </=0.7 kcal mol-1). Thus, at the center of the CH3 structural interface there is a small \"functional interface\" of residues that make significant contributions to complex stability.",

        "abstract": "The oxidized protein repair methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) system has been implicated in aging, in longevity, and in the protection against oxidative stress. This system is made of two different enzymes (MsrA and MsrB) that catalyze the reduction of the two diastereoisomers S- and R-methionine sulfoxide back to methionine within proteins, respectively. Due to its role in cellular protection against oxidative stress that is believed to originate from its reactive oxygen species scavenging ability in combination with exposed methionine at the surface of proteins, the susceptibility of MsrA to hydrogen-peroxide-mediated oxidative inactivation has been analyzed. This study is particularly relevant to the oxidized protein repair function of MsrA in both fighting against oxidized protein formation and being exposed to oxidative stress situations. The enzymatic properties of MsrA indeed rely on the activation of the catalytic cysteine to the thiolate anion form that is potentially susceptible to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. The residual activity and the redox status of the catalytic cysteine were monitored before and after treatment. These experiments showed that the enzyme is only inactivated by high doses of hydrogen peroxide. Although no significant structural modification was detected by near- and far-UV circular dichroism, the conformational stability of oxidized MsrA was decreased as compared to that of native MsrA, making it more prone to degradation by the 20S proteasome. Decreased conformational stability of oxidized MsrA may therefore be considered as a key factor for determining its increased susceptibility to degradation by the proteasome, hence avoiding its intracellular accumulation upon oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "A mutant of a beta-barrel protein, rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein, was predicted to be more stable than the wild-type protein due to a novel hydrogen bond. Equilibrium denaturation studies indicated the opposite: the V60N mutant protein was less stable. The folding transitions followed by CD and fluorescence were reversible and two-state for both mutant and wild-type protein. However, the rates of denaturation and renaturation of V60N were faster. During unfolding, the initial rate was associated with 75-80% of the fluorescence and all of the CD amplitude change. A subsequent rate accounted for the remaining fluorescence change for both proteins; thus the intermediate state lacked secondary structure. During folding, one rate was detected by both fluorescence and CD after an initial burst phase for both wild-type and mutant. An additional slower folding rate was detected by fluorescence for the mutant protein. The structure of the V60N mutant has been obtained and is nearly identical to prior crystal structures of IFABP. Analysis of mean differences in hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions did not readily account for the stability loss due to the mutation. However, significant average differences of the solvent accessible surface and crystallographic displacement factors suggest entropic destabilization.",

        "abstract": "The conformational changes of ribonuclease A due to thermal and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation were monitored by means of precise density and sound velocity measurements. It was found that the apparent molar volume decreased but the adiabatic compressibility increased on thermal denaturation under acidic conditions (pHs 1.60, 1.90, and 2.08). On the other hand, guanidine hydrochloride denaturation (pH 2.00) brought about large decreases in the compressibility and apparent molar volume. These results indicate that the conformation of the denatured protein is greatly different between the two types of denaturation: the thermally denatured state corresponds to the structure with enhanced thermal fluctuation having a residual secondary structure and a high local concentration of nonpolar groups exposed, but the guanidine hydrochloride denaturation leads to exposure of a large amount of amino acid residues, resulting in an increase in hydration and a decrease in the internal cavity. The compressibility changes due to both types of denaturation were not correlated to a loss of the secondary structure, as judged by means of circular dichroism. These findings suggest that the compactness and thermal fluctuation of the protein cannot be described by a two-state denaturation model and that there are some molten-globule-like intermediates in the denaturation processes.",

        "abstract": "The alpha-amylase from Pyrococcus furiosus, a hyperthermophilic archaebacterium, has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 66 kDa. The isoelectric point is 4.3. The enzyme displays optimal activity, with substantial thermal stability, at 100 degrees C, with the onset of activity at approximately 40 degrees C. Unlike mesophilic alpha-amylases there is no dependence on Ca2+ for activity or thermostability. The enzyme displays a broad range of substrate specificity, with the capacity to hydrolyze carbohydrates as simple as maltotriose. No subtrate binding occurs below the temperature threshold of activity, and a decrease in Km accompanies an increase in temperature. Except for a decrease in Asp and an increase in Glu, the amino acid composition does not confirm previously defined trends in thermal adaption. Fourth derivative UV spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence measurements detected no temperature-dependent structural reorganization. Hydrogen exchange results indicate that the molecule is rigid, with only a slight increase in conformational flexibility at elevated temperature. Scanning microcalorimetry detected no considerable change in the heat capacity function, at the pH of optimal activity, within the temperature range in which activity is induced. The heat absorption peak due to denaturation, under these conditions, occurred within the temperature range of 90-120 degrees C. When the pH was increased, a change in the shape of the heat absorption peak was observed, which when analyzed thermodynamically shows that the process of heat denaturation is complex, and includes at least three stages, indicating that the protein structure consists of three domains. At temperatures below 90 degrees C no excess heat absorption or change in the CD spectra were observed which could be associated with the cooperative conformational transition of the protein. According to the thermodynamic characteristics of the heat denaturation, the cold denaturation of this protein can be expected only at -3 degrees C. Therefore, the observed inactivation of this enzyme is not caused by the cooperative change of its tertiary structure. It can be associated only with the gradual changes of protein domain interaction.",

The BRCA1/BARD1 complex demonstrates ubiquitin ligase activity and has been implicated in genomic stability and tumor suppression. Both proteins possess a structurally conserved C-terminal domain (BRCT). While BRCA1-BRCT has been shown to mediate BRCA1 interactions with phosphoproteins such as BRIP1 by recognizing the pSer-X-X-Phe motif, attempts to demonstrate analogous interactions of its dimeric counterpart BARD1-BRCT, have so far been unsuccessful. In this study, chemical-denaturation experiments of BARD1-BRCT domain suggest that its low thermodynamic stability (DeltaG=2.5 kcal/mol) at room temperature, may affect some of its biochemical properties, such as its interaction with phosphopeptides. The stability of BARD1-BRCT domain at 10 degrees C, increases to 7.5 kcal/mol and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments at this lower temperature showed binding to the BRIP1 phosphopeptide via an enthalpy-driven interaction, which appears to be specific to the pSer-X-X-Phe peptide-binding motif. Substitution of either pSer at position 0 with Ser (non-phosphorylated peptide) or Phe with Val at position +3, leads to no-binding ITC results. While these findings are indicative that BRIP1 is a potential BARD1 binding partner, it becomes evident that in vitro binding assays involving the entire BARD1 protein and in vivo experiments are also needed to establish its binding partners and its potential role in tumor suppression pathways.",

        "abstract": "In globular proteins, there are intermolecular hydrogen bonds between protein and water molecules, and between water molecules, which are bound with the proteins, in addition to intramolecular hydrogen bonds. To estimate the contribution of these hydrogen bonds to the conformational stability of a protein, the thermodynamic parameters for denaturation and the crystal structures of five Thr to Val and five Thr to Ala mutant human lysozymes were determined. The denaturation Gibbs energy (DeltaG) of Thr to Val and Thr to Ala mutant proteins was changed from 4.0 to -5.6 kJ/mol and from 1.6 to -6.3 kJ/mol, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type protein. The contribution of hydrogen bonds to the stability (DeltaDeltaG(HB)) of the Thr and other mutant human lysozymes previously reported was extracted from the observed stability changes (DeltaDeltaG) with correction for changes in hydrophobicity and side chain conformational entropy between the wild-type and mutant structures. The estimation of the DeltaDeltaG(HB) values of all mutant proteins after removal of hydrogen bonds, including protein-water hydrogen bonds, indicates a favorable contribution of the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds to the protein stability. The net contribution of an intramolecular hydrogen bond (DeltaG(HB[pp])), an intermolecular one between protein and ordered water molecules (DeltaG(HB[pw])), and an intermolecular one between ordered water molecules (DeltaG(HB[ww])) could be estimated to be 8. 5, 5.2, and 5.0 kJ/mol, respectively, for a 3 A long hydrogen bond. This result shows the different contributions to protein stability of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The entropic cost due to the introduction of a water molecule (DeltaG(H)()2(O)) could be also estimated to be about 8 kJ/mol.",

        "abstract": "Sso7d is a basic 7-kDa DNA-binding protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus, also endowed with ribonuclease activity. The protein consists of a double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, onto which an orthogonal triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet is packed, and of a small helical stretch at the C-terminus. Furthermore, the two beta-sheets enclose an aromatic cluster displaying a fishbone geometry. We previously cloned the Sso7d-encoding gene, expressed it in Escherichia coli, and produced several single-point mutants, either of residues located in the hydrophobic core or of Trp23, which is exposed to the solvent and plays a major role in DNA binding. The mutation F31A was dramatically destabilizing, with a loss in thermo- and piezostabilities by at least 27 K and 10 kbar, respectively. Here, we report the solution structure of the F31A mutant, which was determined by NMR spectroscopy using 744 distance constraints obtained from analysis of multidimensional spectra in conjunction with simulated annealing protocols. The most remarkable finding is the change in orientation of the Trp23 side chain, which in the wild type is completely exposed to the solvent, whereas in the mutant is largely buried in the aromatic cluster. This prevents the formation of a cavity in the hydrophobic core of the mutant, which would arise in the absence of structural rearrangements. We found additional changes produced by the mutation, notably a strong distortion in the beta-sheets with loss in several hydrogen bonds, increased flexibility of some stretches of the backbone, and some local strains. On one hand, these features may justify the dramatic destabilization provoked by the mutation; on the other hand, they highlight the crucial role of the hydrophobic core in protein stability. To the best of our knowledge, no similar rearrangement has been so far described as a result of a single-point mutation.",

        "abstract": "The absence of equilibrium intermediates in protein folding reactions (i.e., two-state folding) simplifies thermodynamic and kinetic analyses but is difficult to prove rigorously. We demonstrate a sensitive method for detecting partially folded species based on using proton chemical shifts as local probes of structure. The coincidence of denaturation curves for probes throughout the molecule is a particularly stringent test for two-state folding. In this study we investigate a new form of the N-terminal domain of bacteriophage lambda repressor consisting of residues 6-85 (lambda 6-85) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD). This truncated version lacks the residues required for dimerization and is monomeric under the conditions used for NMR. Heteronuclear NMR was used to assign the 1H, 15N, and backbone 13C resonances. The secondary and tertiary structure of lambda 6-85 is very similar to that reported for the crystal structure of the DNA-bound 1-92 fragment [Beamer, L. J., and Pabo, C. O. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 227, 177-196], as judged by analysis of chemical shifts, amide hydrogen exchange, amide-alpha coupling constants, and nuclear Overhauser enhancements. Thermal and urea denaturation studies were conducted using the chemical shifts of the four aromatic side chains as local probes and the CD signal at 222 nm as a global probe. Plots of the fraction denatured versus denaturant concentration obtained from these studies are identical for all probes under all conditions studied. This observation provides strong evidence for two-state folding, indicating that there are no populated intermediates in the folding of lambda 6-85.",

Significant gains in secondary structure and the development of hydrophobic surface, respectively, were observed within the dead time of mixing (4-5 ms). These initial increases, or burst phase amplitudes, plotted as a function of final urea concentration, exhibited sigmoidal, coincident unfolding transition curves. The transition curves were fit to a two-state model, and the resulting free energies of folding in the absence of denaturant were found to be similar (approximately 3.3 kcal/mol). Three subsequent slow refolding phases exhibited relaxation times and amplitudes similar to those previously observed for tryptophan fluorescence [Gittelman, M. S., & Matthews, C. R. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 7011-7021]. These results support the proposals that a stable, monomeric intermediate is rapidly formed during the folding of trp aporepressor and that this species contains a significant amount of secondary structure and hydrophobic surface. This early intermediate is then processed through folding and association reactions that result in the formation of the remaining secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure.",

        "abstract": "The thermal unfolding of rabbit skeletal heavy meromyosin (HMM), myosin subfragment 1, and subfragment 2 has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Two distinct endotherms are observed in the DSC scan of heavy meromyosin. The first endotherm, with a Tm of 41 degrees C at pH 7.9 in 0.1 M KCl, is assigned to the unfolding of the subfragment 2 domain of HMM based on scans of isolated subfragment 2. The unfolding of the subfragment 2 domain is reversible both in the isolated form and in HMM. The unfolding of subfragment 2 in HMM can be fit as a single two-state transition with a delta Hvh and delta Hcal of 161 kcal/mol, indicating that subfragment 2 exists as a single domain in HMM. The unfolding of subfragment 2 is characterized by an extraordinarily large delta Cp of approximately 30,000 cal/(deg.mol). In the presence of nucleotides, the high-temperature HMM endotherm with a Tm of 48 degrees C shifts to higher temperature, indicating that this peak corresponds to the unfolding of the subfragment 1 domain. This assignment has been confirmed by comparison with isolated subfragment 1. The stabilizing effect of AMPPNP was significantly greater than that of ADP. The vanadate-trapped ADP species was slightly more stable than M.AMPPNP with a Tm at 58 degrees C. The unfolding of subfragment 1, both in the isolated form and in HMM, was irreversible. Only a single endotherm was noted in the DSC scans of the subfragment 1 domain of HMM and in freshly prepared subfragment 1 complexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "A mutant species of the 185-residue chain of human interleukin-6 lacking 22-residues at its N-terminus and with a Cys-->Ser substitution at positions 45 and 51 was produced in Escherichia coli. The 163-residue protein des-(A1-S22)-[C45S, C51S]interleukin-6, containing a single disulfide bridge, formed inclusion bodies. Mutant interleukin-6 was solubilized in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, subjected to oxidative refolding and purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and hydrophobic chromatography. The purity of the mutant species was established by electrophoresis, isoelectrofocusing and reverse-phase HPLC and its structural identity was checked by N-terminal sequencing of both the intact protein and several of its proteolytic fragments. Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of mutant interleukin-6 gave a molecular mass of 18,695 +/- 2 Da in excellent agreement with the calculated value. Circular dichroic, fluorescence emission and second-derivative ultraviolet absorption spectra indicated that mutant interleukin-6 maintains the overall secondary and tertiary structure, as well as stability characteristics, of the recombinant wild-type human interleukin-6. The urea-induced unfolding of mutant interleukin-6, monitored by circular dichroic measurements in the far-ultraviolet region, occurs as a highly cooperative process with a midpoint of denaturation at 5.5 M urea. The data of the reversible unfolding of mutant interleukin-6 mediated by urea were used to calculate a value of 20.9 +/- 0.4 kJ.mol-1 for the thermodynamic stability of the protein at 25 degrees C in the absence of denaturant. The biological activity of mutant interleukin-6 was evaluated in vitro by the hybridoma proliferation assay, and in vivo by measuring thrombopoiesis in monkeys. Dose/response effects of the mutant were comparable or even higher than those of the wild-type protein. Overall the results of this study show that mutant interleukin-6 is a biologically active cytokine, which could find practical use as a therapeutic agent.",

        "abstract": "Despite its small size, the peripheral subunit-binding domain from the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase component of the Bacillus stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex adopts a unique, compact structure. To determine whether the full 43 residue sequence is required for the domain to adopt a stable, nativelike structure, 3 proteins of different lengths were prepared. Psbd41 corresponds to residues 3-43 of the domain, psbd36 spans residues 6-41, and psbd33 comprises residues 7-39. Psbd41 folds in a cooperative, two-state fashion with a Tm of 53 degrees C and a stability at 25 degrees C of 2.2 kcal mol-1. Psbd36 is nearly as stable with a Tm of 48 degrees C and a stability of 1.8 kcal mol-1. Similar m-values and heat capacities suggest that psbd36 and psbd41 bury approximately the same surface area. Minimal differences in CalphaH and NH chemical shifts between psbd41 and psbd36 show that the two sequences adopt the same tertiary fold. On a per residue basis, DeltaH degrees and DeltaC degrees p fall within the range typical for single-domain globular proteins. Psbd33 is significantly less stable. It is not fully folded at 25 degrees C, and at all temperatures it shows broadened NMR lines. ANS titrations provide evidence that this is due to an equilibrium between nativelike and unfolded molecules rather than formation of a molten globule. The fraction of psbd33 molecules which are folded appear to adopt the same structure as the full-length domain. Thus, although more than the 33 residue core is required to form a fully stable native structure, the entire sequence is not required for folding.",

        "title": "Increased helix and protein stability through the introduction of a new tertiary hydrogen bond.", 
        "abstract": "In an effort to quantify the importance of hydrogen bonding and alpha-helix formation to protein stability, a capping box motif was introduced into the small phosphocarrier protein HPr. Previous studies had confirmed that Ser46, at the N-cap position of the short helix-B in HPr, serves as an N-cap in solution. Thus, only a single-site mutation was required to produce a canonical S-X-X-E capping box: Lys49 at the N3 position was substituted with a glutamic acid residue. Thermal and chemical denaturation studies on the resulting K49E HPr show that the designed variant is approximately 2 kcal mol-1 more stable than the wild-type protein. However, NMR studies indicate that the side-chain of Glu49 does not participate in the expected capping H-bond interaction, but instead forms a new tertiary H-bond that links helix-B to the four-stranded beta-sheet of HPr. Here, we demonstrate that a strategy in which new non-native H-bonds are introduced can generate proteins with increased stability. We discuss why the original capping box design failed, and compare the energetic consequences of the new tertiary side-chain to main-chain H-bond with a local (helix-capping) side-chain to main-chain H-bond on the protein's global stability.",

        "title": "An irregular beta-bulge common to a group of bacterial RNases is an important determinant of stability and function in barnase.", 
        "abstract": "Single amino acid residue substitutions rarely destroy the structural integrity of proteins. Substitution of glycine residues, however, is among the few sorts of alterations that can have such an effect. Here, we seek to understand what accounts for the extreme functional impairment of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase upon substitution of Gly52 or Gly53. We find that inactivation is caused by overall disruption of the folded state that manifests itself in three ways: (1) dramatically reduced stability (by 5.2 to 8.4 kcal mol-1 for mutants showing inactivation in vivo); (2) progressive loss of folded-state activity with increasing temperature, indicating a less well formed fold; and (3) substantial proteolytic degradation of mutant enzymes in vivo. Examination of two deletion mutants, missing either Gly53 or Asp54, shows that the irregular beta-bulge formed by these two residues is of vital importance to the structural integrity of barnase. The parallel behaviour of mutants carrying replacements of either of the two glycine residues therefore appears to arise from a common mechanism: disruption of local structure at the beta-bulge. The importance of this structural element to the function of barnase raises the question of whether it may be present in other RNases. The Streptomyces enzymes RNase Sa and RNase St differ considerably from barnase in both sequence and structure, yet both show significant sequence similarity to barnase over a region beginning at Gly53. Structural comparison indicates that the Streptomyces enzymes do have the barnase-like irregular beta-bulge, making this an important characteristic feature of a group of bacterial ribonucleases. The sensitivity of this feature demonstrates that detailed aspects of local structure may have a major role in determining the overall structural and functional properties of an enzyme, even where no explanation for this role is readily apparent. If this is a general characteristic of the structure-function relationship, it may pose a formidable obstacle to the de novo design of new enzymes.",

        "abstract": "We have designed, synthesized, and characterized a 216 amino acid residue sequence encoding a putative idealized alpha/beta-barrel protein. The design was elaborated in two steps. First, the idealized backbone was defined with geometric parameters representing our target fold: a central eight parallel-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by eight parallel alpha-helices, connected together with short structural turns on both sides of the barrel. An automated sequence selection algorithm, based on the dead-end elimination theorem, was used to find the optimal amino acid sequence fitting the target structure. A synthetic gene coding for the designed sequence was constructed and the recombinant artificial protein was expressed in bacteria, purified and characterized. Far-UV CD spectra with prominent bands at 222nm and 208nm revealed the presence of alpha-helix secondary structures (50%) in fairly good agreement with the model. A pronounced absorption band in the near-UV CD region, arising from immobilized aromatic side-chains, showed that the artificial protein is folded in solution. Chemical unfolding monitored by tryptophan fluorescence revealed a conformational stability (DeltaG(H2O)) of 35kJ/mol. Thermal unfolding monitored by near-UV CD revealed a cooperative transition with an apparent T(m) of 65 degrees C. Moreover, the artificial protein did not exhibit any affinity for the hydrophobic fluorescent probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS), providing additional evidence that the artificial barrel is not in the molten globule state, contrary to previously designed artificial alpha/beta-barrels. Finally, 1H NMR spectra of the folded and unfolded proteins provided evidence for specific interactions in the folded protein. Taken together, the results indicate that the de novo designed alpha/beta-barrel protein adopts a stable three-dimensional structure in solution. These encouraging results show that de novo design of an idealized protein structure of more than 200 amino acid residues is now possible, from construction of a particular backbone conformation to determination of an amino acid sequence with an automated sequence selection algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Heat denaturation of Cry3A delta-endotoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis and its 55 kDa fragment was studied by differential scanning microcalorimetry at low pH. Analysis of the calorimetric data has shown that denaturation of Cry3A delta-endotoxin is a nonequilibrium process at heating rates from 0. 125 to 2 K/min. This means that the stability of delta-endotoxin (the apparent temperature of denaturation Tm) under these conditions is under kinetic control rather than under thermodynamic control. It has been shown that heat denaturation of this protein is a one-step kinetic process. The enthalpy of the process and its activation energy were measured as functions of temperature. The data obtained allow confirmation of the fact that the conformation of delta-endotoxin at the transition state only slightly differs from its native conformation with respect to compactness and extent of hydration. The comparison of the activation energy for intact delta-endotoxin and the 55 kDa fragment showed that the transition of the molecule to a transition state does not cause any changes in the conformation of three N-terminal alpha-helices. Complete removal of the N-terminal domain of delta-endotoxin and 40 amino acids from the C-terminus beta-sheet domain III causes an irreversible loss of the tertiary structure. Thus, during protein folding the nucleation core determining protein stability does not involve its three initial alpha-helices but may include the remaining alpha-helices of the N-terminal domain. The functional significance of peculiarities of structure arrangement of the delta-endotoxin molecule is discussed.",

These four amino acids are highly conserved among family 10 xylanases and structural data have implicated them in substrate binding at the active site. Far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to show that the overall structure of XlnA was not affected by any of these mutations. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the hydrolysis products of birchwood xylan and xylopentaose showed that mutation of these aromatic residues did not alter the enzyme's mode of action. As expected, though, it did reduce the affinity of XlnA for birchwood xylan. A comparison of the kinetic parameters of different mutants at the same position demonstrated the importance of the aromatic nature of W85, Y172 and W274 in substrate binding. Replacement of these residues by a phenylalanine resulted in mutant proteins with a K(M) closer to that of the wild-type protein in comparison with the other mutations analyzed. The kinetic analysis of the mutant proteins at position W266 indicated that this amino acid is important for both substrate binding and efficient catalysis by XlnA. These studies also demonstrated the crucial role of these active site aromatic residues for the thermal stability of XlnA.",

        "abstract": "We have previously determined the crystal structure of a novel pentagonal ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1. Here we have carried out biochemical studies to identify the necessities and/or advantages of this intriguing pentagonal structure. The structure indicated the presence of three neighboring residues (Glu-63, Arg-66, and Asp-69), participating in ionic interactions within unique dimer-dimer interfaces. We constructed three single mutant proteins (E63S, R66S, and D69S) and one triple mutant protein (E63S/R66S/D69S) by replacing the charged residues with serine. The wild type (WT) and all mutant proteins were purified and subjected to gel permeation chromatography at various temperatures. WT and D69S proteins were decameric at all temperatures examined between 30 and 90 degrees C. The majority of E63S and R66S were decamers at 30 degrees C but were found to gradually disassemble with the elevation in temperature. E63S/R66S/D69S was found in a dimeric form even at 30 degrees C. An interesting correlation was found between the subunit assembly and thermostability of the proteins. Circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry analyses indicated that the denaturation temperatures of dimeric enzymes (E63S, R66S, and E63S/R66S/D69S) were approximately 95 degrees C, whereas those of the enzymes retaining a decameric structure (WT and D69S) were approximately 110 degrees C. Disassembly into tetramer or dimer units did not alter the slopes of the Arrhenius plots, indicating that the decameric structure had no effect on catalytic performance per se. The results indicate that the decameric assembly of Tk-Rubisco contributes to enhance the thermostability of the enzyme. Taking into account the growth temperature of strain KOD1 (65-100 degrees C), the decameric structure of Tk-Rubisco can be considered essential for the stable presence of the enzyme in the host cells. This study provides an interesting example in which the thermostability of a protein can be enhanced by formation of a unique quaternary structure not found in mesophilic enzymes.",

The midpoint temperature of thermal denaturation transition (Tm) values of these core constructs range from 60.9 to 77.3 degrees C, extending an earlier, more limited investigation on thermostability. The Tm values of variants containing conservative replacements for the wild type (WT) (Thr 40-Ile 55-Ser 91) triplet are linearly correlated with hydrophobicity (r = 0.81) and, to a lesser degree, with combined side-chain volume (r = 0.75). The X-ray structures of the S91A (1.9 A) and I55L/S91T/D101S (1.7 A) mutants are presented. The former amino acid change is found in duck and mammalian lysozymes, and the latter contains the most thermostable core triplet. A network of four conserved, buried water molecules is associated with the core. It is postulated that these water molecules significantly influence the mutational tolerance at the individual triplet positions. The pH dependence of Tm for the S91D mutant was compared with that of WT enzyme. The pKa of S91D is 1.2 units higher in the native than in the denatured state, corresponding to delta delta G298 = 1.7 kcal/mol. This is a low value for charge burial and likely reflects the moderating influence of the buried water molecules or a conformational change. Thermal and chemical denaturation and far UV CD spectroscopy were used to characterize the in vitro properties of I55T.

The studies were done using wild type chitosanases N174 produced by Streptomyces sp. N174 and SCO produced by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). In addition, two mutants of N174 genetically engineered by single amino acid substitutions (A104L and K164R) and one \"consensus\" (N174-CONS) chitosanase designed by multiple amino acid substitutions of N174 were analyzed. Chitosan used had a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 220 kDa and was 85% deacetylated. Results showed a pH and concentration-dependent protective effect of chitosan in all the cases. However, the extent of thermal protection varied depending on chitosanases, suggesting that key amino acid residues contributed to resistance to heat denaturation. The transition temperatures (T(m)) of N174 were 54 degrees C and 69.5 degrees C in the absence and presence (6 g/l) of chitosan, respectively. T(m) were increased by 11.6 degrees C (N174-CONS), 13.8 degrees C (CSN-A104L), 15.6 degrees C (N174-K164R) and 25.2 degrees C (SCO) in the presence of chitosan (6 g/l). The thermal protective effect was attributed to an enzyme-ligand thermostabilization mechanism since it was not mimicked by the presence of anionic (carboxymethyl cellulose, heparin) or cationic (polyethylene imine) polymers, polyhydroxylated (glycerol, sorbitol) compounds or inorganic salts. Furthermore, the data from fluorometry experiments were in agreement with those obtained by analysis of reaction time-courses performed at 61 degrees C in which case CSN-A104L was rapidly inactivated whereas N174, N174-CONS and N174-K164R remained active over a reaction time of 90 min. This study presents evidence that (1) the fluorometric determination of T(m) in the presence of chitosan is a reliable technique for a rapid assessment of the thermal behavior of chitosanases, (2) it is applicable to structure-function studies of mutant chitosanases and, (3) it can be useful to provide an insight into the mechanism by which mutations can influence chitosanase stability.",

        "abstract": "The small (87-residue) alpha-helical protein Im7 (an inhibitor protein for colicin E7 that provides immunity to cells producing colicin E7) folds via a three-state mechanism involving an on-pathway intermediate. This kinetic intermediate contains three of four native helices that are oriented in a non-native manner so as to minimise exposed hydrophobic surface area at this point in folding. The short (6-residue) helix III has been shown to be unstructured in the intermediate ensemble and does not dock onto the developing hydrophobic core until after the rate-limiting transition state has been traversed. After helix III has docked, it adopts an alpha-helical secondary structure, and the side chains of residues within this region provide contacts that are crucial to native-state stability. In order to probe further the role of helix III in the folding mechanism of Im7, we created a variant that contains an eight-amino-acid polyalanine-like helix stabilised by a Glu-Arg salt bridge and an Asn-Pro-Gly capping motif, juxtaposed C-terminal to the natural 6-residue helix III. The effect of this insertion on the structure of the native protein and its folding mechanism were studied using NMR and varphi-value analysis, respectively. The results reveal a robust native structure that is not perturbed by the presence of the extended helix III. Mutational analysis performed to probe the folding mechanism of the redesigned protein revealed a conserved mechanism involving the canonical three-helical intermediate. The results suggest that folding via a three-helical species stabilised by both native and non-native interactions is an essential feature of Im7 folding, independent of the helical propensity of helix III.",

We have constructed and expressed a recombinant version of gelsolin domain 2 that is sufficiently stable for kinetic and equilibrium measurements. The wild-type domain and the two amyloidogenic mutants fold via simple two-state kinetics without the accumulation of an intermediate. Unfolding kinetics exhibits significant curvature with increasing urea concentration, indicating that the transition state for unfolding becomes more native-like under increasingly denaturing conditions in accordance with the Hammond postulate. Mutations D187N and D187Y destabilize gelsolin domain 2 by 1.22 and 2.16 kcal. mol(-1) (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ) respectively. The mutations do not prevent disulfide bond formation despite their direct contiguity with a cysteine residue involved in disulfide linkage. The destabilization conferred on gelsolin domain 2 by the FAF mutations is sufficient to predict that an appreciable fraction is unfolded and, therefore, extremely susceptible to proteolysis at body temperature.",

        "abstract": "The conformational constraints on protein denatured states are of prime importance in modulating early events in protein folding. Although structural studies have demonstrated residual structure in protein denatured states, much remains poorly understood with regard to the conformational properties of this state. Here, we investigate topological effects on loop formation probabilities in denatured iso-1-cytochrome c by comparing histidine-heme binding affinities for histidines on the N- versus the C-terminal side of the heme. For histidines N-terminal to the heme (preceding cysteine 14), the polypeptide emerges from the edge of the heme and must simply fold over to bind to the heme. For histidines C-terminal to the heme (following histidine 18), the polypeptide emerges from the back side of the heme and must wrap around the heme for the histidine to bind to the heme. Thus, the steric constraints on this wrap-around topology are expected to be much more demanding than for the heme-edge topology of the N-terminal histidines. Evaluation of loop formation probabilities in 3 M guanidine hydrochloride, conditions that fully denature the variants studied, demonstrates that N-terminal histidine-heme loop formation is 10-25-fold more favorable than C-terminal histidine-heme loop formation, for similar loop sizes. A two-dimensional square lattice model indicates that excluded volume is important in this topological preference. These data provide direct evidence that denatured state topology affects contact probability, and thus probable folding pathways, in a disordered protein.",

In order to identify important functional regions of RAP, studies were performed to define the domain organization and domain boundaries of this molecule. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments revealed that the process of thermal denaturation of RAP is highly reversible and occurs in a broad temperature range with two well resolved heat absorption peaks. A good fit of the endotherm was obtained with four two-state transitions suggesting these many cooperative domains in the molecule. A number of recombinant fragments of RAP were expressed in bacteria, and their domain composition and stability were characterized by DSC, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results confirmed that RAP is composed of four independently folded domains, D1, D2, D3, and D4, that encompass residues 1-92, 93-163, 164-216, and 217-323, respectively. The first and the fourth domains preserved their structure and stability when isolated, whereas the compact structure of the fragment corresponding to D2 seems to be altered when isolated from the parent molecule. Isolated D3 was partially degraded during isolation from bacterial lysates. The isolated D4 was capable of binding with high affinity to LRP whereas neither D1 nor D2 bound. At the same time a fragment containing both D1 and D2 exhibited high affinity binding to LRP. These facts combined with the thermodynamic analysis of the melting process of the fragments containing D1 and D2 indicate that these two domains interact with each other and that the proper folding of the second domain into a native-like active conformation requires presence of the first domain.",

        "abstract": "A thermodynamic analysis of a cold-adapted protein, type III anti-freeze protein (AFP), was carried out. The results indicate that the folding equilibrium of type III AFP is a reversible, unimolecular, two-state process with no populated intermediates. Compared to most mesophilic proteins whose folding is two-state, the psychrophilic type III AFP has a much lower thermodynamic stability at 25 degrees C, approximately 3 kcal/mol, and presents a remarkably downshifted stability-temperature curve, reaching a maximum of 5 kcal/mol around 0 degrees C. Type III AFPs contain few and non-optimally distributed surface charges relative to their mesophilic homologs, the C-terminal domains of sialic acid synthases. We used thermodynamic double mutant cycles to evaluate the energetic role of every surface salt bridge in type III AFP. Two isolated salt bridges provided no contribution to stability, while the Asp36-Arg39 salt bridge, involved in a salt bridge network with the C-terminal carboxylate, had a substantial contribution (approximately 1 kcal/mol). However, this contribution was more than counteracted by the destabilizing effect of the Asp36 carboxylate itself, whose removal led to a net 30% increase in stability at 25 degrees C. This study suggests that type III AFPs may have evolved for a minimally acceptable stability at the restricted, low temperature range (around 0 degrees C) at which AFPs must function. In addition, it indicates that salt bridge networks are used in nature also for the stability of psychrophilic proteins, and has led to a type III AFP variant of increased stability that could be used for biotechnological purposes.",

        "abstract": "Our aim is to determine whether the disulfide bonds of alpha-lactalbumin account for the lack of cooperative folding behavior reported for some molten globule variants, in contrast to the highly cooperative folding reported for the pH 4 molten globule of apomyoglobin. Two different alpha-lactalbumin genetic constructs are studied: [28-111], which has a single disulfide bond connecting two segments of the alpha-helix domain, and [all-Ala], which has no disulfide bonds. The superposition test used earlier to probe for cooperative folding of the apomyoglobin molten globule is used to determine whether there is an important difference in folding cooperativity between the molten globules of [28-111] and [all-Ala]. The [all-Ala] construct behaves in the same manner as the apomyoglobin molten globule: its folding satisfies the superposition test in the three sets of anion conditions studied, and anions stabilize it against urea unfolding. The [28-111] construct behaves differently in both respects: the folding of its molten globule does not satisfy the superposition test in two of the three sets of anion conditions, and anions barely affect its stability. The 28-111 disulfide bond stabilizes the molten globule substantially, as expected from earlier work. Comparison of the unfolding transition curves monitored by circular dichroism also demonstrates that [28-111] folds in a less cooperative manner than [all-Ala]: the unfolding curve of [28-111] is significantly broader. Moreover, the unfolding curves indicate that [28-111] has a lower helix content than [all-Ala]. Consequently, the 28-111 bond constrains the folding behavior of the molten globule and weakens its cooperativity of folding.",

        "abstract": "A heterologous overexpression system for mesophilic Pseudomonas aeruginosa holocytochrome c(551) (PA c(551)) was established using Escherichia coli as a host organism. Amino acid residues were systematically substituted in three regions of PA c(551) with the corresponding residues from thermophilic Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c(552) (HT c(552)), which has similar main chain folding to PA c(551), but is more stable to heat. Thermodynamic properties of PA c(551) with one of three single mutations (Phe-7 to Ala, Phe-34 to Tyr, or Val-78 to Ile) showed that these mutants had increased thermostability compared with that of the wild-type. Ala-7 and Ile-78 may contribute to the thermostability by tighter hydrophobic packing, which is indicated by the three dimensional structure comparison of PA c(551) with HT c(552). In the Phe-34 to Tyr mutant, the hydroxyl group of the Tyr residue and the guanidyl base of Arg-47 formed a hydrogen bond, which did not exist between the corresponding residues in HT c(552). We also found that stability of mutant proteins to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride correlated with that against the thermal denaturation. These results and others described here suggest that significant stabilization of PA c(551) can be achieved through a few amino acid substitutions determined by molecular modeling with reference to the structure of HT c(552). The higher stability of HT c(552) may in part be attributed to some of these substitutions.",

        "abstract": "Protein kinases are regulated by conformational or chemical changes which facilitate access of substrates to the active site and promote correct orientations of catalytically essential residues and water molecules. The switch between basal and activated states of the insulin receptor's kinase domain (IRKD) results from autophosphorylation. We investigated the effects of IRKD autophosphorylation on the conformational stability by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) dependent denaturation and by iodide quenching of intrinsic fluorescence. Tryptophan residues of the recombinant soluble IRKD (residues R953-S1355) were excited at a lambdaex of 295 nm, and emission spectra were analyzed for centroid (a characteristic of average polarity of the indole rings' environments) and integrated fluorescence intensity over the lambdaem range of 310-420 nm. Denaturation profiles of both apo- and phospho-IRKD forms are complex with at least three distinct unfolding transitions. The first and last transitions were reversible and cooperative and had midpoints at 0.4 or 0.7 M GdnHCl and 2.4 or 2.7 M GdnHCl, respectively; transitions of phospho-IRKD occurred at lower GdnHCl concentrations. Calculations of free energy of unfolding suggested a loss of approximately 2.3 kcal/mol of stabilization for the first transition and approximately 1.5 kcal/mol for the third transition. Circular dichroism showed subtle changes in secondary structure over the first transition and global unfolding over the last transition. The first transition reports changes primarily in the local environment of W1175, which is near the catalytic loop and is conserved among protein tyrosine kinases. W1175 is also the dominant fluorophore of the native emission spectrum. Iodide quenching of W1175 was virtually undetectable in the apo-IRKD but significant in the phospho-IRKD, suggesting that W1175 exposure to small solutes is strongly dependent on the conformation of the activation loop. These studies indicate that autophosphorylation, while exposing the catalytic center, also produces a conformer less stable than the apoenzyme.",

Despite the increased hydrophobicity of the side chains, the free energy changes of unfolding of the two mutants (G121V and G121L) determined by urea denaturation at 15 degrees C were decreased by 1.22 and 0.38 kcal/mol, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type. Thermal denaturation temperature, as monitored by differential scanning calorimetry, was decreased by 2.4 and 5.2 degrees C for G121V and G121L, respectively, accompanying the decrease in enthalpy change of denaturation. These findings indicate that the structure of DHFR is destabilized by the mutations, predominantly due to the large decrease in enthalpy change of denaturation relative to entropy change of denaturation. The steady-state kinetic parameter in the enzyme reaction, Km, was not influenced but kcat was greatly decreased by these mutations, resulting in 240- and 52-fold decreases in kcat/Km for G121V and G121L, respectively. The main effect of the mutations appeared to be modification of the flexibility of the loop due to overcrowding of the bulky side chains, overcoming the enhancement of hydrophobic interaction.",

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of the cupredoxin plastocyanin (PC) from spinach has been studied with the aim of improving the understanding of factors involved in the conformational stability of antiparallel beta-sheet proteins. Studies using differential scanning calorimetry have been complemented with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and mass spectrometry in elucidation of the effect of the copper-site oxidation state on the irreversible thermal denaturation process. Our results indicate that copper-catalyzed oxidation of the metal-ligating cysteine is the sole factor resulting in thermal irreversibility. However, this can be prevented in reduced protein by the removal of molecular oxygen. Application of a two-state equilibrium transition model to the folding process thus allowed the extraction of thermodynamic parameters for the reduced protein (Delta(trs)H = 494 kJ mol(-1), DeltaH(vH) = 343 kJ mol(-1), and T(m) = 71 degrees C). However, anaerobically denatured oxidized protein and all aerobically denatured species undergo covalent modification as a result of the copper-catalyzed oxidation of the metal-ligating cysteine residue resulting in the formation of both oxidized monomers and disulfide-linked dimers. On the basis of these results, a general mechanism for the irreversible thermal denaturation of cupredoxins is proposed. The results presented here also indicate that PC, as opposed to the previously characterized homologous protein azurin, unfolds via at least one significantly populated intermediate state (DeltaH(vH)/Delta(trs)H = 0.7) despite the almost identical native state topologies of these proteins. These findings will aid the characterization of the stability of PC and other cupredoxins and possibly of all cysteine-ligating metal-binding proteins.",

Thermal and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of these proteinases produced first-order, two-state, kinetic behaviour.

Oxidation to remove 37.8% of the carbohydrate of M. miehei glycoproteinase with sodium metaperiodate resulted in a substantial decrease in both kinetic and equilibrium stabilities without modification of the amino acid composition or specific activity.

These results were used to measure the stabilities of the proteins. The hydrogen-exchange stabilities (DeltaG(HX)) for the most stable residues in each variant agree with the equilibrium conformational stability measured by urea denaturation (DeltaG(U)), if the effects of D(2)O and proline isomerization are included [Huyghues-Despointes, B. M. P., Scholtz, J. M., and Pace, C. N. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 210-212]. These residues also show similar changes in DeltaG(HX) upon Ala --> Gly mutations (DeltaDeltaG(HX)) as compared to equilibrium measurements (DeltaDeltaG(U)), indicating that the most stable residues are exchanging from the globally unfolded ensemble. Alanine is stabilizing compared to glycine by 1 kcal/mol at a solvent-exposed site 21 as seen by other methods for the RNase T1 protein and peptide helix [Myers, J. K., Pace, C. N., and Scholtz, J.

For the G23A variant, large chemical shift changes are seen throughout the sequence, although X-ray crystal structures of the variant and RNase T1 are nearly superimposable.

        "abstract": "We have identified specific regions of the polypeptide chain of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) that are critical for stabilizing the oxidative folding intermediate des-[40-95] (with three native disulfide bonds but lacking the fourth native Cys40-Cys95 disulfide bond) in an ensemble of largely disordered three-disulfide precursors (3S if des-[40-95]). A stable analogue of des-[40-95], viz., [C40A, C95A] RNase A, which contains three out of four native disulfide pairings, was previously found to have a three-dimensional structure very similar to that of the wild-type protein. However, it is determined here from GdnHCl denaturation experiments to have significantly reduced global stability, i.e., = 4.5 kcal /mol at 20 degrees C and pH 4.6. The local stability of [C40A, C95A] RNase A was also examined using site-specific amide (2)H/(1)H exchange measurements at pD 5.0 to determine the individual unfolding free energy of specific residues under both strongly native (12 degrees C) and more destabilizing (20 degrees C) conditions. Comparison of the relative stabilities at specific amide sites of [C40A, C95A] RNase A at both temperatures with the corresponding values for the wild-type protein at 35 degrees C corroborates previous experimental evidence that unidentified intramolecular contacts in the vicinity of the preferentially formed native one-disulfide (C65-C72) loop are crucial for stabilizing early folding intermediates, leading to des-[40-95]. Moreover, values of for residues at or near the third alpha-helix, and in part of the second beta-sheet of [C40A, C95A] RNase A, indicate that these two regions of regular backbone structure contribute to stabilizing the global chain fold of the des-[40-95] disulfide-folding intermediate in the wild-type protein. More significantly, we have identified numerous specific residues in the first alpha-helix and the first beta-sheet of the protein that are stabilized in the final step of the major oxidative regeneration pathway of RNase A (des-[40-95] --> N).",

        "abstract": "Data from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) may be used to estimate very large binding constants that cannot be conveniently measured by more conventional equilibrium techniques. Thermodynamic models have been formulated to describe interacting systems that involve either one thermal transition (protein-ligand) or two thermal transitions (protein-protein) and either 1:1 or higher binding stoichiometry. Methods are described for obtaining binding constants and heats of binding by two different methods: calculation or simulation fitting of data. Extensive DSC data on 2'CMP binding to RNase are presented and analyzed by the two methods. It is found that the methods agree when binding sites are completely saturated, but substantial errors arise in the calculation method when site saturation is incomplete and the transition of liganded molecules overlaps that of unliganded molecules. This arises primarily from an inability to determine TM (i.e., the temperature where concentrations of folded and unfolded protein are equal) under weak-binding conditions. Results from simulation show that the binding constants and heats of binding from the DSC method agree quantitatively with corresponding estimates obtained from equilibrium methods when extrapolated to the same temperature. It was also found from the DSC data that the binding constant decreases with increasing concentration of ligand, which might arise from nonideality effects associated with dimerization of 2'CMP. Simulations show that the DSC method is capable of estimating binding constants for ultratight interactions up to perhaps 10(40) M-1 or higher, while most equilibrium methods fail well below 10(10) M-1. DSC data from the literature on a number of interacting systems (trypsin-soybean trypsin inhibitor, trypsin-ovomucoid, trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, chymotrypsin-subtilisin inhibitor, subtilisin BPN-subtilisin inhibitor, RNase S protein-RNase S peptide, avidin-biotin, ovotransferrin-Fe3+, superoxide dismutase-Zn2+, alkaline phosphatase-Zn2+, and assembly of regulatory and catalytic subunits of aspartate transcarbamoylase) were analyzed by simulation fitting or by calculation. Apparent single-site binding constants ranged from ca. 10(5) to 10(20) M-1, while the interaction constant for assembly of aspartate transcarbamoylase was estimated as 10(37) in molarity units. For most of these systems, the DSC interaction constants compared favorably with other literature estimates, for some it did not for reasons unknown, while for still others this represented the first estimate. Simulations show that for proteins having two binding sites for the same ligand within a single cooperative unit, ligand rearrangement will occur spontaneously during a DSC scan as the transition temperature of the unliganded protein is approached.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The urea and heat-induced unfolding-refolding behaviours of chicken egg white ovomucoid and its four fragments representing domains I, II + III, I + II and III were systematically investigated in 0.06 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) by difference spectral measurements. The effect of temperature on ovomucoid and its fragments was also studied in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and in presence of 2 M urea at pH 7.0. Intrinsic viscosity data showed that ovomucoid and its different fragments did not lose any significant amount of their structure under mild acidic conditions (pH 4.6). Difference spectral results showed extensive disruption of the native structure by urea or temperature. Isothermal transitions showed single-step for domain I, domain I + II and domain III, and two-step having one stable intermediate, for ovomucoid and its fragment representing domain II + III. However, the presence of intermediate was not detected when the transitions were studied with temperature at pH 7.0. Strikingly, the single-step thermal transitions of ovomucoid and its fragment representing domain II + III, became two-step when measured either at pH 5.0 or in presence of 2 M urea at pH 7.0. Analysis of the equilibrium data on urea and heat denaturation showed that the second transition observed with ovomucoid or domain II + III represent the unfolding of domain III. The kinetic results of ovomucoid and its fragments indicate that the protein unfolds with three kinetic phases. A comparison of three rate constants for the unfolding of intact ovomucoid with that of its various fragments revealed that domain I, II and III of the protein correspond to the three kinetic phases having rate constants 0.456, 0.120 and 0.054 min-1, respectively. These data have led us to conclude: (i) the unusual stability of ovomucoid towards various denaturants, including temperature, is due to its domain III, (ii) initiation of the folding of the ovomucoid molecule starts from its NH2-terminal region which probably provides the nucleation site for the formation of the subsequent structure and (iii) domains I and II have greater mutual recognition between them as compared to the recognition either of them have with domain III.",

        "abstract": "A simple theoretical model for increasing the protein stability by adequately redesigning the distribution of charged residues on the surface of the native protein was tested experimentally. Using the molecule of ubiquitin as a model system, we predicted possible amino acid substitutions on the surface of this protein which would lead to an increase in its stability. Experimental validation for this prediction was achieved by measuring the stabilities of single-site-substituted ubiquitin variants using urea-induced unfolding monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy. We show that the generated variants of ubiquitin are indeed more stable than the wild-type protein, in qualitative agreement with the theoretical prediction. As a positive control, theoretical predictions for destabilizing amino acid substitutions on the surface of the ubiquitin molecule were considered as well. These predictions were also tested experimentally using correspondingly designed variants of ubiquitin. We found that these variants are less stable than the wild-type protein, again in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These observations provide guidelines for rational design of more stable proteins and suggest a possible mechanism of structural stability of proteins from thermophilic organisms.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant pyrophosphatase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (S-PPase) has been heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and could be purified in large quantities. S-PPase, previously described as a tetrameric enzyme, was shown to be a homohexameric protein that had catalytic activity with Mg2+ > Zn2+ > Co2+ > Mn2+ > Ni2+, Ca2+. CD and FTIR spectra demonstrate a similar overall fold for S-PPase and PPases from E. coli (E-PPase) and Thermus thermophilus (T-PPase). The relative proportions of secondary structure elements in S-PPase are close to those of a previously proposed model. S-PPase is extremely heat resistant. Even at 95 degrees C the half-life of catalytic activity is 2.5 h, which is dramatically increased in the presence of divalent cations. More than one Mg2+ per monomer is needed for catalysis, but no more than one Mg2+ per monomer is sufficient for thermal stabilization. The Tm values for S-PPase are 89 degrees C (+EDTA), 99 degrees C (+Mg2+), and >100 degrees C (+Mn2+), compared to 58 degrees C (+EDTA), 84 degrees C (+Mg2+), and 93 degrees C (+Mn2+) for E-PPase and 86 degrees C (+EDTA), 99 degrees C (+Mg2+), and 96 degrees C (+Mn2+) for T-PPase. The guanidium hydrochloride-induced unfolding follows an unknown mechanism with a biphasic kinetic and an unstable intermediate. Unfolding curves of the S-, E-, and T-PPase are independent of the method applied (CD spectroscopy and fluorescence) and show a sigmoidal and monophasic transition, indicating a change in global structure during unfolding, which can be described by a two-state process comprising dissociation and denaturation of the folded hexamer into six monomers. The respective DeltaGN-->D(25 degrees C) values of the three PPases vary from 220 to 290 kJ/mol for the overall process and are not significantly higher for the two thermophilic PPases. The stabilizing effect of Mg2+ DeltaDeltaG(25 degrees C) is 16 kJ/mol for E-PPase and 5.5-8 kJ/mol for S-PPase and T-PPase.",

        "abstract": "The effects of single amino acid replacements on the stability of the 14-38 disulfide bond in the native form of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) were measured. A total of 17 mutant proteins, with substitutions at one of 7 residues located 5-15 A from the disulfide in the native wild-type protein, were examined. The replacements were found to decrease the thermodynamic stability of the disulfide, as measured by exchange with thiol-disulfide reagents, by 0.6-5 kcal/mol, corresponding to a range of nearly 100 mV in redox potentials. The effects of the substitutions on disulfide stability were roughly correlated with the changes in side-chain volume, suggesting that optimal packing is a major factor in determining the stability of the disulfide in the wild-type protein. With only one exception, the substitutions also led to increases, as large as 50-fold, in the rates of disulfide reduction by dithiothreitol. The increased rates of reduction suggest that at least a fraction of the mutational destabilization of the disulfide is due to strain in the native protein that is relieved in the transition state for reduction. The stability of the disulfide in a peptide corresponding to the segments that are linked together by the 14-38 disulfide in native BPTI was found to be about 5 kcal/mol less than that of the disulfide in the intact wild-type protein. Together, the results with the mutant proteins and the peptide indicate that the stability of the disulfide in the native protein depends on both the local environment of the disulfide and on the ability of the rest of the protein to favor a conformation that promotes disulfide formation.",

        "abstract": "Apomyoglobin folding proceeds through a molten globule intermediate (low-salt form; I1) that has been characterized by equilibrium (pH 4) and kinetic (pH 6) folding experiments. Of the eight alpha-helices in myoglobin, three (A, G, and H) are structured in I1, while the rest appear to be unfolded. Here we report on the structure and stability of a second intermediate, the trichloroacetate form of the molten globule intermediate (I2), which is induced either from the acid-unfolded protein or from I1 by > or = 5 mM sodium trichloroacetate. Circular dichroism measurements monitoring urea- and acid-induced unfolding indicate that I2 is more highly structured and more stable than I1. Although I2 exhibits properties closer to those of the native protein, one-dimensional NMR spectra show that it maintains the lack of fixed side-chain structure that is the hallmark of a molten globule. Amide proton exchange and 1H-15N two-dimensional NMR experiments are used to identify the source of the extra helicity observed in I2. The results reveal that the existing A, G, and H helices present in I1 have become more stable in I2 and that a fourth helix--the B helix--has been incorporated into the molten globule. Available evidence is consistent with I2 being an on-pathway intermediate. The data support the view that apomyoglobin folds in a sequential fashion through a single pathway populated by intermediates of increasing structure and stability.",

        "abstract": "The two most buried carboxyl groups in ribonuclease Sa (RNase Sa) are Asp33 (99% buried; pK 2.4) and Asp79 (85% buried; pK 7.4). Above these pK values, the stability of the D33A variant is 6kcal/mol less than wild-type RNase Sa, and the stability of the D79A variant is 3.3kcal/mol greater than wild-type RNase Sa. The key structural difference between the carboxyl groups is that Asp33 forms three intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and Asp79 forms no intramolecular hydrogen bond. Here, we focus on Asp79 and describe studies of 11 Asp79 variants. Most of the variants were at least 2kcal/mol more stable than wild-type RNase Sa, and the most interesting was D79F. At pH 3, below the pK of Asp79, RNase Sa is 0.3kcal/mol more stable than the D79F variant. At pH 8.5, above the pK of Asp79, RNase Sa is 3.7kcal/mol less stable than the D79F variant. The unfavorable contribution of Asp79 to the stability appears to result from the Born self-energy of burying the charge and, more importantly, from unfavorable charge-charge interactions. To counteract the effect of the negative charge on Asp79, we prepared the Q94K variant and the crystal structure showed that the amino group of the Lys formed a hydrogen-bonded ion pair (distance, 2.71A; angle, 100 degrees ) with the carboxyl group of Asp79. The stability of the Q94K variant was about the same as the wild-type at pH 3, where Asp79 is uncharged, but 1kcal/mol greater than that of wild-type RNase Sa at pH 8.5, where Asp79 is charged. Differences in hydrophobicity, steric strain, Born self-energy, and electrostatic interactions all appear to contribute to the range of stabilities observed in the variants. When it is possible, replacing buried, non-hydrogen bonded, ionizable side-chains with non-polar side-chains is an excellent means of increasing protein stability.",

        "abstract": "In previous kinetic studies of Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase, it was determined that some substitutions of conserved cysteine 191, which is located outside of the active site, altered the kinetic parameters of the enzyme (Gloss,L.M., Spencer,D. E. and Kirsch,J.F., 1996, Protein Struct. Funct. Genet., 24, 195-208). The mutations resulted in an alkaline shift of 0.6-0.8 pH units for the pK(a) of the internal aldimine between the PLP cofactor and Lys258. The change in the pK(a) affected the pH dependence of the k(cat)/K(m) (aspartate) values for the mutant enzymes. To help to understand these observations, crystal structures of five mutant forms of E.coli aspartate aminotransferase (the maleate complexes of C191S, C191F, C191Y and C191W, and C191S without maleate) were determined at about 2 A resolution in the presence of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor. The overall three-dimensional fold of each mutant enzyme is the same as that of the wild-type protein, but there is a rotation of the mutated side chain around its C(alpha)-C(beta) bond. This side chain rotation results in a change in the pattern of hydrogen bonding connecting the mutant residue and the protonated Schiff base of the cofactor, which could account for the altered pK(a) of the Schiff base imine nitrogen that was reported previously. These results demonstrate how residues outside the active site can be important in helping determine the subtleties of the active site amino acid geometries and interactions and how mutations outside the active site can have effects on catalysis. In addition, these results help explain the surprising result previously reported that, for some mutant proteins, replacement of a buried cysteine with an aromatic side chain did not destabilize the protein fold. Instead, rotation around the C(alpha)-C(beta) bond allowed each large aromatic side chain to become buried in a nearby pocket without large changes in the enzyme's backbone geometry.",

The intermediate was characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation, spectroscopy, and collisional fluorescence quenching, which imply that the monomeric intermediate maintains a high degree, but not all, of native secondary structure. Although intrinsic fluorescence from native and intermediate suggests little change in tryptophan environments, fluorescence intensities from fluorescein reporter groups differ significantly between the two structures. Analysis of the collisional quenching results imply that the intermediate is characterized by tryptophans with increased accessibility to small solutes and less overall compactness than the native protein.",

The thermal stabilities of the truncated H2A-H2B dimer and the truncated (H3-H4)/(H3-H4)(2) system were studied by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The thermal denaturation of the truncated H2A-H2B dimer at pH 6.0 and low ionic strength is centered at 47.3 degrees C. The corresponding enthalpy change is 35 kcal/mol of 11.5 kDa monomer unit, and the heat capacity change upon unfolding is 1.2 kcal/(K mol of 11.5 kDa monomer unit). At pH 4.5 and low ionic strength, the truncated (H3-H4)/(H3-H4)(2) system, like its full-length counterpart, is quantitatively dissociated into two truncated H3-H4 dimers. The thermal denaturation of the truncated H3-H4 dimer is characterized by the presence of a single calorimetric peak centered at 60 degrees C. The enthalpy change is 25 kcal/mol of 10 kDa monomer unit, and the change in heat capacity upon unfolding is 0.5 kcal/(K mol of 10 kDa monomer unit). The thermal stabilities of both types of truncated dimers exhibit salt and pH dependencies similar to those of the full-length proteins. Finally, like their full-length counterparts, both truncated core histone dimers undergo thermal denaturation as highly cooperative units, without the involvement of any significant population of melting intermediates. Therefore, removal of the histone \"tails\" does not generally affect the thermodynamic behavior of the subunits of the core histone complex, indicating that the more centrally located regions of the histone fold and the extra-fold structured elements are primarily responsible for their stability and responses to parameters of their chemical microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "A total of fifty single site surface phenylalanine substitution mutants have been made in the model protein staphylococcal nuclease. The fifty residues that were replaced with phenylalanine were chosen to give a broad sampling of solvent accessibility, secondary structure, and backbone conformations. The change in the stability of each mutant protein relative to wild type was measured by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. These results were compared to previous results obtained when these same sites were substituted with an alanine and a glycine. By this means, changes in the stability due to the loss of interactions of the wild-type side chain can be separated from the effects of introducing the bulky, hydrophobic phenylalanine in these solvent-exposed positions. In general, our results agree with the conventional wisdom that placing a hydrophobic residue in a solvent-exposed position is destabilizing in most cases, but less destabilizing than most changes in the hydrophobic core of the protein. However, the degree to which a hydrophobic surface substitution destabilizes or stabilizes a globular protein is highly context-dependent, with some mutations being as destabilizing as those in the core. This indicates that steric and packing considerations are also important on the surface of a globular protein but generally are not as important as in the interior. No evidence for the widespread occurrence of the so-called reverse hydrophobic effect at solvent-exposed sites was found. In addition, this survey of numerous sites suggests that previous measurements of alpha-helix \"propensities\" often seriously underestimate the importance of the environment of the side chain.",

        "abstract": "The folding kinetics and thermodynamics of the isolated C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 (CTL9) have been studied as a function of pH. CTL9 is an alpha-beta protein that contains a single beta-sheet with an unusual mixed parallel, anti-parallel topology. The folding is fully reversible and two-state over the entire pH range. Stopped-flow fluorescence and CD experiments yield the same folding rate, and the chevron plots have the characteristic V-shape expected for two-state folding. The values of DeltaG*(H2O) and the m value calculated from the kinetic experiments are in excellent agreement with the equilibrium measurements. The extrapolated initial amplitudes of both the stopped-flow fluorescence and CD measurements show that there is no detectable burst phase intermediate. The domain contains three histidine residues, two of which are largely buried in the native state. They do not participate in salt-bridges or take part in a hydrogen bonded network. NMR measurements reveal that the buried histidine residues have significantly perturbed pK(a) values in the native state. The equilibrium stability and the folding rate are found to be strongly dependent upon their ionization state. There is a linear relationship between the log of the folding rate and DeltaG* (H2O) . The protein is much more stable and folds noticeably faster at pH values above the native state pK(a) values. DeltaG*(H2O) of unfolding increases from 2.90 kcal mol(-1) at pH 5.0 to 6.40 kcal mol(-1) at pH 8.0 while the folding rate increases from 0.60 to 18.7 s(-1). Tanford linkage analysis revealed that the interactions involving the two histidine residues are largely developed in the transition state. The results are compared to other studies of the pH-dependence of folding.",

        "abstract": "The folding mechanisms of two proteins in the family of intracellular lipid binding proteins, ileal lipid binding protein (ILBP) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP), were examined. The structures of these all-beta-proteins are very similar, with 123 of the 127 amino acids of ILBP having backbone and C(beta) conformations nearly identical to those of 123 of the 131 residues of IFABP. Despite this structural similarity, the sequences of these proteins have diverged, with 23% sequence identity and an additional 16% sequence similarity. The folding process was completely reversible, and no significant concentrations of intermediates were observed by circular dichroism or fluorescence at equilibrium for either protein. ILBP was less stable than IFABP with a midpoint of 2. 9 M urea compared to 4.0 M urea for IFABP. Stopped-flow kinetic studies showed that both the folding and unfolding of these proteins were not monophasic, suggesting that either multiple paths or intermediate states were present during these processes. Proline isomerization is unlikely to be the cause of the multiphasic kinetics. ILBP had an intermediate state with molten globule-like spectral properties, whereas IFABP had an intermediate state with little if any secondary structure during folding and unfolding. Double-jump experiments showed that these intermediates appear to be on the folding path for each protein. The folding mechanisms of these proteins were markedly different, suggesting that the different sequences of these two proteins dictate different paths through the folding landscape to the same final structure.",

Comparative studies of the physical properties (absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism) of the three enzymes were performed as a function of pH. Also, the proteins were reversibly melted as a function of pH. Since the unfolding reaction appeared to be a two-state process for all these proteins, the data were analyzed by the van 't Hoff procedure.

        "abstract": "We have examined the pathway and energetics of urea-induced dissociation and unfolding of the catalytic trimer (c3) of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli at low temperature in the absence and presence of carbamyl phosphate (CP; a substrate), N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-Asp (PALA; a bisubstrate analog), and 2 anionic inhibitors, Cl- and ATP, by analytical gel chromatography supplemented by activity assays and ultraviolet difference spectroscopy. In the absence of active-site ligands and in the presence of ATP, c3 dissociates below 2 M urea into swollen c chains that then gradually unfold from 2 to 6 M urea with little apparent cooperativity. Linear extrapolation to 0 M urea of free energies determined in 3 independent types of experiments yields estimates for delta Gdissociation at 7.5 degrees C of about 7-10 kcal m-1 per interface. delta Gunfolding of dissociated chains when modeled as a 2-state process is estimated to be very small, on the order of -2 kcal m-1. The data are also consistent with the possibility that the unfolding of the dissociated monomer is a 1-state swelling process. In the presence of the ligands CP and PALA, and in the presence of Cl-, c3 dissociates at much higher urea concentrations, and trimer dissociation and unfolding occur simultaneously and apparently cooperatively, at urea concentrations that increase with the affinity of the ligand.",

        "abstract": "The de novo design of peptides and proteins has emerged as an attractive approach for investigating protein structure and function. Here, the design, synthesis, and characterization of a new series of alpha-helical peptides intended to form antiparallel four-stranded coiled coils is described. Computer models were generated without the use of extant protein structures and were used to refine the sequence. The peptides are of the general formula Ncap-(XaZbZcLdZeZfZg)3-Ccap, where X is either Ala, Val, Thr, or Leu, and Ncap and Ccap are sequences designed to satisfy the helices unpaired amide nitrogens and carbonyl oxygens, respectively. The hydrophobic residues (at positions a and d) were chosen so that geometric packing of large and small hydrophobes would favor an antiparallel arrangement. Special attention was also given to residues at the helix--helix interfaces. These residues were chosen to balance potential attractive and repulsive electrostatic forces so that the desired topology was favored while other possible folds were destabilized. Two of the four peptides associate under neutral conditions into the desired tetramers. One of the complexes (a = Val) behaves like a native-like protein as judged by NMR, thermodynamics, and apolar dye (ANS) binding. The other tetrameric complex (a = Leu) exhibits broader NMR resonances, diminished values of delta H and delta Cp, and tight binding of the hydrophobic dye ANS, similar to early designed proteins. These results reinforce the importance of optimizing van der Waals packing interactions in protein design but demonstrate that hydrophobic packing must be balanced with hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions to produce novel native-like proteins.",

        "abstract": "The thermal stability of a Schizolobium parahyba chymotrypsin inhibitor (SPCI) as a function of pH has been investigated using fluorescence, circular dichroism, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermodynamic parameters derived from all methods are remarkably similar and strongly suggest the high stability of SPCI under a wide range of pH. The transition temperature (T(m)) values ranging from 57 to 85.3 degrees C at acidic, neutral, and alkaline pH are in good agreement with proteins from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms and corroborate previous data regarding the thermal stability of SPCI. All methods gave transitions curves adequately fitted to a two-state model of the unfolding process as judged by the cooperative ratio between the van't Hoff and the calorimetric enthalpy energies close to unity in all of the pH conditions analyzed, except at pH 3.0. Thermodynamic analysis using all these methods reveals that SPCI is thermally a highly stable protein, over the wide range of pH from 3.0 to 8.8, exhibiting high stability in the pH region of 5.0-7.0. The corresponding maximum stabilities, DeltaG(25), were obtained at pH 7.0 with values of 15.4 kcal mol(-1) (combined fluorescence and circular dichroism data), and 15.1 kcal mol(-1) (DSC), considering a DeltaC(p) of 1.72 +/- 0.24 kcal mol(-1) K(-1). The low histidine content ( approximately 1.7%) and the high acidic residue content ( approximately 22.5%) suggests a flat pH dependence of thermal stability in the region 2.0-8.8 and that the decrease in thermal stability at low pH can be due to the differences in pK values of the acidic groups.",

In contrast to mammalian apoA-I's, which self-associate in the absence of lipid, chicken apoA-I, which shares 66% sequence homology with human apoA-I, exists as a monomeric protein when dissociated from high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Sedimentation equilibrium studies conducted in the analytical ultracentrifuge yielded a weight-average molecular weight of 28,170. Corresponding sedimentation velocity and diffusion experiments gave rise to s0(20,w) = 2.23 S and D0(20,w) = 6.39 x 10(-7) cm2/s. A translational frictional ratio (f/fmin) of 1.18 and an axial ratio of 4.0 were also determined from this data. The Stokes radius (Rs,sed = 2.80 nm) and translational frictional ratio were subsequently used to calculate estimated molecular dimensions of 25.2 x 100.8 A for chicken apoA-I. Circular dichroism (CD) studies revealed a highly alpha-helical structure predicted to be 74% by Provencher-Gl\u00f6ckner analysis. Denaturation studies performed on lipid-free apoA-I and monitored by CD revealed a midpoint of denaturation of 0.64 M guanidine hydrochloride. From plots of delta G(app) versus guanidine hydrochloride concentration, a delta GDH2O of 1.86 kcal/mol was determined. In other studies, a midpoint of temperature-induced denaturation for apoA-I of 57 degrees C was obtained. The effect of solvent pH on the secondary structure content of apoA-I revealed a significant loss of alpha-helix below pH 4.0 and above pH 10, suggesting that lipid-free apoA-I may by partially stabilized by the formation of intra- or interhelix salt bridges between oppositely charged amino acid side chains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Onconase (ONC) from Rana pipiens is the smallest member of the ribonuclease A (RNase A) superfamily. Despite a tertiary structure similar to RNase A, ONC is distinguished by an extremely high thermodynamic stability. In the present paper we have probed the significance of three structural regions, which exhibit structural peculiarities in comparison to RNase A, for the stability of ONC to temperature and guanidine hydrochloride induced denaturation: (i) the N-terminal pyroglutamate residue, (ii) the hydrophobic cluster between helix I and the first beta-sheet, and (iii) the C-terminal disulfide bond. For this purpose, the enzyme variants <E1E-, <E1P-, F28T-, F28A-, F36Y-, and C87A/C104A-ONC were produced and studied in equilibrium and kinetic measurements. The destabilizing influence of the mutations strongly depended on the modified structural region. The exchanges of the N-terminal pyroglutamate (<E1E- and <E1P-ONC) had the smallest impact (DeltaDeltaG([D])50% = 4.2 and 7.0 kJ mol(-)(1)), while interferences in the hydrophobic cluster (F28T-, F28A-, and F36Y-ONC) had larger effects (DeltaDeltaG([D])50% = 22.2, 20.9, and 19.5 kJ mol(-)(1)). The removal of the C-terminal disulfide bond (C87A/C104A-ONC) showed the largest influence on stability (DeltaDeltaG([D])50% = 32.0 kJ mol(-)(1)). As concluded from the comparison of DeltaDeltaG([D])50% and DeltaDeltaG++(U)[D]50%, all destabilization effects were exclusively caused by increased unfolding rate constants except for C87A/C104A-ONC, where unfolding as well as folding was impacted. Of all amino acid residues investigated, Phe28, which is unique for ONC among the ribonucleases, had the greatest importance for rate of unfolding. Our data on the folding and unfolding kinetics indicate that the strong stabilization of ONC in comparison to RNase A is caused by a dramatic deceleration of the unfolding reaction.",

        "title": "L-phenylalanine binding and domain organization in human phenylalanine hydroxylase: a differential scanning calorimetry study.", 
        "abstract": "Human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH) is a tetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) to L-tyrosine; a dysfunction of this enzyme causes phenylketonuria. Each subunit in hPAH contains an N-terminal regulatory domain (Ser2-Ser110), a catalytic domain (Asp112-Arg410), and an oligomerization domain (Ser411-Lys452) including dimerization and tetramerization motifs. Two partially overlapping transitions are seen in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms for wild-type hPAH in 0.1 M Na-Hepes buffer, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.0. Although these transitions are irreversible, studies on their scan-rate dependence support that the equilibrium thermodynamics analysis is permissible in this case. Comparison with the DSC thermograms for truncated forms of the enzyme, studies on the protein and L-Phe concentration effects on the transitions, and structure-energetic calculations based on a modeled structure support that the thermal denaturation of hPAH occurs in three stages: (i) unfolding of the four regulatory domains, which is responsible for the low-temperature calorimetric transition; (ii) unfolding of two (out of the four) catalytic domains, which is responsible for the high-temperature transition; and (iii) irreversible protein denaturation, which is likely responsible for the observed exothermic distortion in the high-temperature side of the high-temperature transition. Stages 1 and 2 do not appear to be two-state processes. We present an approach to the analysis of ligand effects on DSC transition temperatures, which is based on the general binding polynomial formalism and is not restricted to two-state transitions. Application of this approach to the L-Phe effect on the DSC thermograms for hPAH suggests that (i) there are no binding sites for L-Phe in the regulatory domains; therefore, contrary to the common belief, the activation of PAH by L-Phe seems to be the result of its homotropic cooperative binding to the active sites. (ii) The regulatory domain appears to be involved in cooperativity through its interactions with the catalytic and oligomerization domains; thus, upon regulatory domain unfolding, the cooperativity in the binding of L-Phe to the catalytic domains seems to be lost and the value of the L-Phe concentration corresponding to half-saturation is increased. Overall, our results contribute to the understanding of the conformational stability and the substrate-induced cooperative activation of this important enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Pleurotus ostreatus proteinase A inhibitor 1 (POIA1) has been shown to be unique among the various serine protease inhibitors in that its C-terminal region appears to be the reactive site responsible for its inhibitory action toward proteases. To investigate in more detail the mechanism of inhibition by POIA1, we have been studying its structural requirements for stable inhibition of proteases. In this study, we focused on hydrophobic Phe residues, which are generally located in the interior of protein molecules. A Phe-->Ala replacement at position 44 or 56 was introduced into a 'parent' mutant of POIA1 that had been converted into a strong and resistant inhibitor of subtilisin BPN' by replacement of its six C-terminal residues with those of the propeptide of subtilisin BPN' and the effects on inhibitory properties and structural stability were examined. Both of the mutated POIA1 molecules not only were found to exhibit decreased ability to bind to subtilisin BPN' (80-fold for the F44A mutant and 13-fold for the F56A mutant), but were also converted to temporary inhibitors that were degraded by the protease. The structural stability of the mutated POIA1 was also lowered, as shown by a 13 degrees C decrease in melting temperature for the F56A mutant. In particular, the F44A mutant was found to lose its tertiary structure, as judged from the circular dichroism spectrum, demonstrating that Phe44 is a strict requirement for structural formation by the POIA1 molecule. These results clearly indicate that stabilization of POIA1 by hydrophobic residues in its molecular interior is required for stable inhibition of the protease. This requirement for a stable tertiary structure is shared with other serine protease inhibitors, but other structural requirements seem to differ, in that strong binding with the protease is required for POIA1 whereas conformational rigidity around the reactive site is essential for many other protease inhibitors.",

For these studies, temperature, guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), and pH were used as perturbants, and the effects were measured by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry, isothermal reaction calorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy, and partial protease digestion. At pH 7.5 and in the absence of any additional perturbants, the thermal unfolding of the B-subunit pentamer is characterized by a single peak in the heat capacity function centered at 77 degrees C and characterized by a delta Hcal of 328 kcal/mol of B-subunit pentamer and delta Hvh/delta Hcal of 0.3. Lowering the pH down to 4 or adding GuHCl up to 2 M results in a decrease of the calorimetric enthalpy with no significant effect on the van't Hoff enthalpy. The transition enthalpy decreases in a sigmoidal fashion with pH, with an inflection point centered at pH 5.3. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies as a function of pH also report a transition centered at pH 5.3 and characterized by an enthalpy change of 27 kcal/mol of B-subunit pentamer at 27 degrees C. Below this pH, the enthalpy change for the unfolding transition is reduced to approximately 100 kcal/mol of B-subunit pentamer. Similar behavior is obtained with GuHCl.

        "abstract": "The intestinal fatty acid binding protein is one of a family of proteins that are composed of two beta-sheets surrounding a large interior cavity into which the ligand binds. Glycine residues occur in many of the turns between adjacent antiparallel beta-strands. In previous work, the effect of replacing these glycine residues with valine has been examined with stopped flow instrumentation using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy [Kim and Frieden (1998) Protein Sci. 7, 1821-1828]. To resolve the burst phase missing in the stopped flow measurements, these valine mutants have been reexamined with sub-millisecond continuous flow instrumentation. Some of the glycine residues have also been replaced with proline, and the folding reactions of these proline mutants have been compared with those of their valine counterparts. In all cases, the stability of the protein is decreased, but some turns appear to be more critical for final structure stabilization than others. Surprisingly, the rate constants observed for all the mutants measured by sub-millisecond continuous flow methods are quite similar (1400-3000 s(-1)), and in all the mutants, there is a shift in the fluorescence emission maximum from that of the unfolded protein to lower wavelengths, suggesting some collapse of the unfolded state within 200 micros. In contrast to the rate constants observed for the initial folding events measured by the sub-millisecond continuous flow method, the rate constants for the slower phase observed in the stopped flow instrument vary widely for the different mutants. The latter step appears to be related to side chain stabilization rather than secondary structure formation. It is also shown that the ligand binds tightly only to the native protein and not to any intermediate forms.",

One mutation associated with MBD entails the H107Y substitution where H107 is a highly conserved residue in the carbonic anhydrase protein family.

        "abstract": "The thermodynamics of the binding of L-arabinose and of D-galactose to the L-arabinose-binding protein of Escherichia coli have been studied by isothermal and scanning calorimetry. The binding reaction with arabinose is characterized by an enthalpy change of -15.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol-1 at 25 degrees C, and a large decrease in apparent heat capacity, amounting to -0.44 +/- 0.05 kcal K-1 mol-1, which is constant over the temperature range 8 to 30 degrees C. Very similar results were obtained with D-galactose. These calorimetric results have been combined with binding constants determined by equilibrium dialysis (Clark, A. F., Gerken, T. A., and Hogg, R. W. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 2227-2233) to obtain free energy and entropy changes over the range 5 to 30 degrees C, and by extrapolation to 60 degrees C. The protein undergoes reversible unfolding on being heated with an increase in enthalpy at 53.5 degrees C of 151.8 +/- 1.1 kcal mol-1 (169.2 +/- 1.2 kcal mol-1 at 59.0 degrees C) and in apparent heat capacity of 3.16 +/- 0.07 kcal K-1 mol-1. In the presence of arabinose, the unfolding enthalpy is increased to 200.7 +/- 1.8 kcal mol-1 at 59.0 degrees C, the increase being due to the enthalpy of dissociation of the ligand which amounts to 31 kcal mol-1 at the unfolding temperature. The unfolding temperature is increased by the presence of excess arabinose or galactose, an effect which is due solely to displacement by the added ligand of the unfolding-dissociation equilibrium. The thermodynamic data are discussed in connection with the detailed structural information available for this system from x-ray crystallography (Newcomer, M. E., Gilliland, G. L. and Quiocho, F. A.

        "abstract": "Identification and evaluation of factors important for thermostability in proteins is a growing research field with many industrial applications. This study investigates the effects of introducing a novel disulfide bond and engineered electrostatic interactions with respect to the thermostability of holo azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Four mutants were selected on the basis of rational design and novel temperature-dependent atomic displacement factors from crystal data collected at elevated temperatures. The atomic displacement parameters describe the molecular movement at higher temperatures. The thermostability was evaluated by optical spectroscopy as well as by differential scanning calorimetry. Although azurin has a high inherent stability, the introduction of a novel disulfide bond connecting a flexible loop with small alpha-helix (D62C/K74C copper-containing mutant), increased the T(m) by 3.7 degrees C compared with the holo protein. Furthermore, three mutants were designed to introduce electrostatic interactions, K24R, D23E/K128R, and D23E/K128R/K24R. Mutant K24R stabilizes loops between two separate beta-strands and D23E/K128R was selected to stabilize the C-terminus of azurin. Furthermore, D23E/K128R/K24R was selected to reflect the combination of the electrostatic interactions in D23E/K128R and K24R. The mutants involving electrostatic interactions had a minor effect on the thermostability. The crystal structures of the copper-containing mutants D62C/K74C and K24R have been determined to 1.5 and 1.8 A resolution. In addition the crystal structure of the zinc-loaded mutant D62C/K74C has also been completed to 1.8 A resolution. These structures support the selected design and provide valuable information for evaluating effects of the modifications on the thermostability of holo azurin.",

        "abstract": "The linear extrapolation method was used to evaluate the unfolding free energy changes (delta G degrees N-U) for phenylmethanesulfonyl chymotrypsin (PMS-Ct) at pH 6.0. The nonlinear least-squares fits of difference spectral data using urea and guanidinium chloride as denaturants gave identical values for delta G degrees N-U and delta epsilon degrees U, the latter being extinction coefficient differences between native and unfolded forms of the protein in the limit of zero concentration of denaturant. The independence of these parameters from the nature of solvent suggests strongly that they are characteristic properties of the protein alone. The delta G degrees N-U data at pH 6.0 and 4.0, which differ by more than 100-fold in stability of the protein, were incorporated into a thermodynamic cycle involving free energy changes for titration of native and unfolded PMS-Ct from pH 4.0 to 6.0. The purpose of the cycle was to test whether delta G degrees N-U obtained by use of the linear extrapolation method exhibits the characteristics required of a thermodynamic function of state. Within error, the thermodynamic cycle was found to accommodate the delta G degrees N-U quantities obtained at pH 4.0 and 6.0 for PMS-Ct.",

        "abstract": "Characteristics and properties of the unfolding free energy change, delta G degrees N-U, as determined by the linear extrapolation method are assessed for the unfolding of phenylmethanesulfonyl chymotrypsin (PMS-Ct). Difference spectral measurements at 293 nm were used to define PMS-Ct unfolding brought about with guanidinium chloride, urea, and 1,3-dimethylurea. All three denaturants were shown to give identical extinction coefficient differences (delta epsilon N-U) between native and unfolded forms of the protein in the limit of zero concentration of denaturant. The independence of delta epsilon N-U on denaturant supports the linear extension of pre- and postdenaturational base lines into the transition zone, allowing evaluation of unfolding equilibrium constants based on the two-state assumption. An expression, based on the linear extrapolation method, was used to provide estimates of delta G degrees N-U for the three denaturants using nonlinear least-squares fitting of the primary data, delta epsilon versus [denaturant]. The three delta G degrees N-U values were identical, within error, suggesting that the free energy change is a property of the protein system and independent of denaturant. It is suggested that the error in delta G degrees N-U determined from use of the linear extrapolation method is significantly larger than commonly reported in the literature.",

        "abstract": "To elucidate early nucleation stages in protein folding, multi-probed thermodynamic characterization was applied to the beta-hairpin structural formation of G-peptide, which is a C-terminal fragment of the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G. The segment corresponding to the sequence of G-peptide is believed to act as a nucleus during the folding process of the B1 domain. In spite of the broad thermal transition of G-peptide, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) melting measurements combined with our original analytical theory enabled us to obtain the thermodynamic properties of the beta-hairpin formation with considerable accuracy. Additionally, all the thermodynamic properties determined by every NMR probe on both the main-chain and the side-chains were quite similar, and also comparable to the values that were independently determined by calorimetric analysis of G-peptide. These results demonstrate that G-peptide folds cooperatively throughout the molecule. In other words, the formation of the beta-hairpin is interpreted as the fashion of a first-order phase transition between two states without any distinguishable intermediates. This cooperative formation of the short linear peptide consisting of only 16 residues provides insight into not only the first folding events of the B1 domain, but also the general principles of proteins in terms of structural hierarchy, stability and folding mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium assembly of purified GDP-tubulin into microtubules induced by taxol and Taxotere has been studied as a function of solution variables, ligand, and nucleotide, in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffers. Assembly is coupled to the binding of one taxoid molecule per tubulin heterodimer, while binding to the unassembled protein is not detected within ligand solubility limits. Linked functions analysis has indicated that two Mg2+ and no more H+ ions are bound per tubulin-taxoid polymerized, and the heat capacity change is negligible within experimental error (determined by van't Hoff analysis and by differential scanning calorimetry), in contrast with drug-free control microtubule assembly and with the abnormal polymerization of the tubulin-colchicine complex. The apparent enthalpy change is ca. 240 kJ mol-1 (calorimetry), and the process is entropy driven. The apparent standard free energy change of taxoid-induced elongation at 2 mM free Mg2+, pH 6.1-6.7, and 37 degrees C is -29.5 +/- 0.4 (taxol) or -31.5 +/- 0.4 kJ mol-1 (Taxotere). This is independent of taxoid excess, which has indicated that the process measured corresponds to the elongation equilibrium of the fully liganded protein. Comparison to elongation in the absence of drug suggests an apparent linkage free energy change of binding and polymerization of -11.3 +/- 1.2 kJ mol-1. The taxoid-induced elongation of GTP-tubulin proceeds with an increment of apparent free energy change of -2.5 +/- 0.4 kJ mol-1 over GDP-tubulin. It is proposed that the taxoid binding changes the conformation of GDP-tubulin from inactive to active, allowing productive binding and elongation at the microtubule end. Among several possible model mechanisms discussed, it is particularly attractive to think of taxoids as double-sided ligands, which bind to tubulin at the microtubule end and participate in a lateral contact interface with the newly added tubulin molecule. In the kinetic pathway of assembly, these ligands should bind first to inactive Mg(2+)-induced linear GDP-tubulin oligomers and transform them into active bidimensional polymerization nuclei.",

        "abstract": "The T4 lysozyme mutant Ser 117-->Phe was isolated fortuitously and found to be more thermostable than wild-type by 1.1-1.4 kcal/mol. In the wild-type structure, the side chain of Ser 117 is in a sterically restricted region near the protein surface and forms a short hydrogen bond with Asn 132. The crystal structure of the S117F mutant shows that the introduced Phe side chain rotates by about 150 degrees about the C alpha-C beta bond relative to wild type and is buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein. Burial of Phe 117 is accommodated by rearrangements of the surrounding side chains of Leu 121, Leu 133, and Phe 153 and by main-chain shifts, which result in a minimal increase in packing density. The benzyl rings of Phe 117 and Phe 153 form a near-optimal edge-face interaction in the mutant structure. This aromatic-aromatic interaction, as well as increased hydrophobic stabilization and elimination of a close contact in the wild-type protein, apparently compensate for the loss of a hydrogen bond and the possible cost of structural rearrangements in the mutant. The structure illustrates the ability of a protein to accommodate a surprisingly large structural change in a manner that actually increases thermal stability. The mutant has activity about 10% that of wild-type, supportive of the prior hypothesis (Gr\u00fctter, M.G. & Matthews, B.W., 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 154, 525-535) that the peptidoglycan substrate of T4 lysozyme makes extended contacts with the C-terminal domain in the vicinity of Ser 117.",

        "abstract": "Thermal stabilities of mutant ribonuclease HI proteins from Escherichia coli, in which each of five histidine residues was replaced with alanine, were examined at various pHs. Increases in the Tm values were observed at pH 3.0 for four of the mutant proteins, in which each of the four histidine residues exposed to the solvent was mutated, as compared to the Tm of the wild-type protein. The thermostabilization of three of the mutant proteins was dependent on pH, and only observed at low pH. The thermostabilizing effects of the His-->Ala substitutions were cumulative. The temperature of the midpoint of the transition in the thermal unfolding curves, Tm, of the most stable mutant enzyme, in which His 62, His 83, His 124, and His 127 were replaced by Ala, was 5.5 degrees C higher than that of the wild-type enzyme at pH 3.0. The stability of the wild-type protein decreased as the pH was lowered below pH 4, a condition favoring the protonation of carboxyl groups, probably due to unfavorable electrostatic interactions introduced by the increase in positive charges on the protein. Since imidazole groups are positively charged at pH 3.0, it seems likely that thermal stabilization at pH 3.0 by a His-->Ala substitution would be the result of a reduction in such unfavorable electrostatic interactions. These results suggest that amino acid substitutions that cause a decrease in the number of positive charges on the surface of a protein can be used as a general strategy to enhance protein stability at pH values below pH 4.",

        "abstract": "The stability of protein is defined not only by the hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, van der Waals interactions, and salt bridges. Additional, much more subtle contributions to protein stability can arise from surface residues that change their properties upon unfolding. The recombinant major cold shock protein of Escherichia coli CspA an all-beta protein unfolds reversible in a two-state manner, and behaves in all other respects as typical globular protein. However, the enthalpy of CspA unfolding strongly depends on the pH and buffer composition. Detailed analysis of the unfolding enthalpies as a function of pH and buffers with different heats of ionization shows that CspA unfolding in the pH range 5.5-9.0 is linked to protonation of an amino group. This amino group appears to be the N-terminal alpha-amino group of the CspA molecule. It undergoes a 1.6 U shift in pKa values between native and unfolded states. Although this shift in pKa is expected to contribute approximately 5 kJ/mol to CspA stabilization energy the experimentally observed stabilization is only approximately 1 kJ/mol. This discrepancy is related to a strong enthalpy-entropy compensation due, most likely, to the differences in hydration of the protonated and deprotonated forms of the alpha-amino group.",

        "abstract": "The alkaline proteinase inhibitor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (APRin), a high-affinity inhibitor of the serralysin family of bacterial metalloproteinases, is folded into an eight-stranded beta-barrel with an N-terminal trunk linked to the barrel by a single-turn alpha-helix (helix A, residues 8-11). We show here that deletion or modification of helix A decreases the conformational stability of APRin as assessed by thermal and chemical denaturation with guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The apparent melting temperature T(m) of the wild-type protein was 81.5 degrees C at pH 7.1 as assessed by circular dichroism and 87.5 degrees C by differential scanning calorimetry. Reduction of the single disulfide bond of APRin decreased T(m) by approximately 18 degrees C, while deletion of residues 6-10 or 1-10 lowered T(m) by approximately 8 and approximately 14 degrees C, respectively. DeltaG(u) as assessed by chemical denaturation was 7.2 kcal mol(-)(1) at 25 degrees C for wild-type APRin and was decreased by 3.4, 2.4, and 2.6 kcal mol(-)(1) by disulfide reduction, deletion of residues 6-10, and deletion of residues 1-10, respectively. In contrast, deletion of residues 1-5 had no significant effect on either T(m) or DeltaG(u). Substitution of five helix-breaking Gly or Pro residues in positions 6-10 as well as disruption of hydrogen bonds involving residues within helix A (mutants Asp10Pro and Trp15Phe) also decreased T(m) and DeltaG(u). The data suggest that a hydrogen-bonding network involving Leu11 in helix A and Trp15 located at the top of the barrel may prevent access of solvent to the interior of the barrel. Disruption of the helix could facilitate solvation of the nonpolar interior of the barrel, thereby destabilizing its folded structure. Kinetic studies with single amino acid mutants in helix A indicate that it modulates the affinity of APRin for APR primarily by influencing the dissociation rate of the inhibitor from the complex.",

        "abstract": "Ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) from Pseudomonas putida biotype B is a homodimeric enzyme catalyzing an allylic rearrangement of Delta5-3-ketosteroids at rates comparable with the diffusion-controlled limit. The tyrosine triad (Tyr14.Tyr55.Tyr30) forming a hydrogen-bond network in the apolar active site of KSI has been characterized in an effort to identify the roles of the phenyl rings in catalysis, stability, and unfolding of the enzyme. The replacement of Tyr14, a catalytic residue, with serine resulted in a 33-fold decrease of kcat, while the replacements of Tyr30 and Tyr55 with serine decreased kcat by 4- and 51-fold, respectively. The large decrease of kcat for Y55S could be due to the structural perturbation of alpha-helix A3, which results in the reorientation of the active-site residues as judged by the crystal structure of Y55S determined at 2.2 A resolution. Consistent with the analysis of the Y55S crystal structure, the far-UV circular dichroism spectra of Y14S, Y30S, and Y55S indicated that the elimination of the phenyl ring of the tyrosine reduced significantly the content of alpha-helices. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments revealed that the DeltaG(U)H2O values of Y14S, Y30S, and Y55S were significantly decreased by 11.9, 13.7, and 9.5 kcal/mol, respectively, as compared with that of the wild type. A characterization of the unfolding kinetics based on PhiU-value analysis indicates that the interactions mediated by the tyrosine triad in the native state are very resistant to unfolding. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the internal packing by the phenyl rings in the active-site tyrosine triad contributes to the conformational stability and catalytic activity of KSI by maintaining the structural integrity of the alpha-helices.",

The previously designed artificial globin (DG1) folded into a monomeric, compact, highly helical and globular form with overall dimensions similar to those of the target structure, but it lacked structural uniqueness at the side-chain level [Isogai, Y., Ota, M., Fujisawa, T. , Izuno, H., Mukai, M., Nakamura, H., Iizuka, T., and Nishikawa, K. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 7431-7443]. In this study, we redesigned hydrophobic sites of DG1 to improve the structural specificity. Several Leu and Met residues in DG1 were replaced with beta-branched amino acids, Ile and Val, referring to the 3D profile of DG1 to produce three redesigned globins, DG2-4. These residue replacements resulted in no significant changes of their compactness and alpha-helical contents in the absence of denaturant, whereas they significantly affected the dependence of the secondary structure on the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride. The analyses of the denaturation curves revealed higher global stabilities of the designed globins than that of natural apoMb. Among DG1-4, DG3, in which 11 Leu residues of DG1 are replaced with seven Ile and four Val residues, and one Met residue is replaced with Val, displayed the lowest stability but the most cooperative folding-unfolding transition and the most dispersed NMR spectrum with the smallest line width. The present results indicate that the replacements of Leu (Met) with the beta-branched amino acids at appropriate sites reduce the freedom of side-chain conformation and improve the structural specificity at the expense of stability.",

We have engineered a mutant in which a unique tryptophan replaces the tyrosine residue found in the tyrosine corner of this Greek key protein, a region that has been proposed to have an important role in folding. Equilibrium denaturation of Y74W apo-pseudoazurin demonstrated multistate unfolding in urea (pH 7.0, 0.5 M Na(2)SO(4) at 15 degrees C), in which one or more partially folded species are populated in 4. 3 M urea. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, we show that these species, on average, have lost a substantial portion of the native secondary structure, lack fixed tertiary packing involving tryptophan and tyrosine residues, are less compact than the native state as determined by fluorescence lifetimes and time-resolved anisotropy, but retain significant residual structure involving the trytophan residue. Peptides ranging in length from 11 to 30 residues encompassing this region, however, did not contain detectable nonrandom structure, suggesting that long-range interactions are important for stabilizing the equilibrium partially unfolded species in the intact protein. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the equilibrium denaturation of Y74W apo-pseudoazurin generates one or more partially unfolded species that are globally collapsed and retain elements of the native structure involving the newly introduced tryptophan residue. We speculate on the role of such intermediates in the generation of the complex Greek key fold.",

        "abstract": "The stabilities of 66 sequence variants of the human Pin1 WW domain have been determined by equilibrium thermal denaturation experiments. All 34 residues composing the hPin1 WW three-stranded beta-sheet structure could be replaced one at a time with at least one different natural or non-natural amino acid residue without leading to an unfolded protein. Alanine substitutions at only four positions within the hPin1 WW domain lead to a partially or completely unfolded protein-in the absence of a physiological ligand. The side chains of these four residues form a conserved, partially solvent-inaccessible, continuous hydrophobic minicore comprising the N- and C-termini. Ala mutations at five other residues, three of which constitute the ligand binding patch on the concave side of the beta-sheet, significantly destabilize the hPin1 WW domain without leading to an unfolded protein. The remaining mutations affect protein stability only slightly, suggesting that only a small subset of side chain interactions within the hPin1 WW domain are mandatory for acquiring and maintaining a stable, cooperatively folded beta-sheet structure.",

        "abstract": "It was found that the affinity of a monoclonal antibody directed against a recombinantly expressed HIV-1 capsid protein p24 (rp24) strongly increased after chemical modification of the Iysine residues of rp24 with different amounts of maleic anhydride. The extent and the sites of modification were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Unmodified rp24 and the differently modified rp24 samples were tested for binding the murine monoclonal antibody CB4-1 which recognizes the epitope GATPQDLNTML comprising residues 46-56 of rp24. An increase in the number of modified lysine residues led to enhanced binding affinity of CB4-1. Most pronounced effects were observed after substitution of the first amino groups: an average number of three modified residues per protein molecule increases the binding affinity by a factor of 23, but the substitution of the remaining nine residues increases the binding affinity only by a factor of 11. Fully modified rp24 variant proteins were bound by CB4-1 with Kd values comparable to that of the peptide epitope. Conformation and stability of the unmodified rp24, highly (rp24F, 9 residues; rp24G, 11 residues) modified, and fully modified protein (rp24I, 11 lysine residues and N-terminus) were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy under different solvent conditions. Little difference in conformation and unfolding behavior was observed between the unmodified and highly modified rp24, which differ drastically in the antibody binding behavior. The fully modified sample, however, displayed a significant decrease in alpha-helical content. Thus, the epitope seems to be hidden (cryptotope) in the unmodified rp24 in a low-affinity binding conformation and becomes displayed at low levels of chemical modification which obviously induce subtle structural changes prior to changes of the overall folding observable by spectroscopic means.",

        "abstract": "The flavoenzyme DAAO from Rhodotorula gracilis, a structural paradigm of the glutathione-reductase family of flavoproteins, is a stable homodimer with a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecule tightly bound to each 40-kD subunit. In this work, the thermal unfolding of dimeric DAAO was compared with that of two monomeric forms of the same protein: a Deltaloop mutant, in which 14 residues belonging to a loop connecting strands betaF5-betaF6 have been deleted, and a monomer obtained by treating the native holoenzyme with 0.5 M NH(4)SCN. Thiocyanate specifically and reversibly affects monomer association in wild-type DAAO by acting on hydrophobic residues and on ionic pairs between the betaF5-betaF6 loop of one monomer and the alphaI3' and alphaI3\" helices of the symmetry-related monomer. By using circular dichroism spectroscopy, protein and flavin fluorescence, activity assays, and DSC, we demonstrated that thermal unfolding involves (in order of increasing temperatures) loss of tertiary structure, followed by loss of some elements of secondary structure, and by general unfolding of the protein structure that was concomitant to FAD release. Temperature stability of wild-type DAAO is related to the presence of a dimeric structure that affects the stability of independent structural domains. The monomeric Deltaloop mutant is thermodynamically less stable than dimeric wild-type DAAO (with melting temperatures (T(m)s) of 48 degrees C and 54 degrees C, respectively). The absence of complications ensuing from association equilibria in the mutant Deltaloop DAAO allowed identification of two energetic domains: a low-temperature energetic domain related to unfolding of tertiary structure, and a high-temperature energetic domain related to loss of secondary structure elements and to flavin release.",

        "abstract": "After a cytokine binds to its receptor on the cell surface (pH approximately 7), the complex is internalized into acidic endosomal compartments (pH approximately 5-6), where partially unfolded intermediates can form. The nature of these structural transitions was studied for wild-type interleukin-2 (IL-2) and wild-type granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). A noncoincidence of denaturation transitions in the secondary and tertiary structure of IL-2 and tertiary structural perturbations in G-CSF suggest the presence of an intermediate state for each, a common feature of this structural family of four-helical bundle proteins. Unexpectedly, both IL-2 and G-CSF display monotonic increases in stability as the pH is decreased from 7 to 4. We hypothesize that such cytokines with cell-based clearance mechanisms in vivo may have evolved to help stabilize endosomal complexes for sorting to lysosomal degradation. We show that mutants of both IL-2 and G-CSF have differential stabilities to their wild-type counterparts as a function of pH, and that these differences may explain the differences in ligand trafficking and depletion. Further understanding of the structural changes accompanying unfolding may help guide cytokine design with respect to ligand binding, endocytic trafficking, and, consequently, therapeutic efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Increasing the conformational stability of proteins is an important goal for both basic research and industrial applications. In vitro selection has been used successfully to increase protein stability, but more often site-directed mutagenesis is used to optimize the various forces that contribute to protein stability. In previous studies, we showed that improving electrostatic interactions on the protein surface and improving the beta-turn sequences were good general strategies for increasing protein stability, and used them to increase the stability of RNase Sa. By incorporating seven of these mutations in RNase Sa, we increased the stability by 5.3 kcal/mol. Adding one more mutation, D79F, gave a total increase in stability of 7.7 kcal/mol, and a melting temperature 28 degrees C higher than the wild-type enzyme. Surprisingly, the D79F mutation lowers the change in heat capacity for folding, DeltaC(p), by 0.6 kcal/mol/K. This suggests that this mutation stabilizes structure in the denatured state ensemble. We made other mutants that give some insight into the structure present in the denatured state. Finally, the thermodynamics of folding of these stabilized variants of RNase Sa are compared with those observed for proteins from thermophiles.",

        "abstract": "Pectate lyase C (pelC) was the first protein in which the parallel beta-helix structure was recognized. The unique features of parallel beta-helix-containing proteins-a relatively simple topology and unusual interactions among side chains-make pelC an interesting protein to study with respect to protein folding. In this paper, we report studies of the unfolding equilibrium of pelC. PelC is unfolded reversibly by gdn-HCl at pH 7 and 5, as monitored by far- and near-UV CD and fluorescence. The coincidence of these spectroscopically detected transitions is consistent with a two-state transition at pH 7, but the three probes are not coincident at pH 5. No evidence was found for a loosely folded intermediate in the transition region at pH 5. At pH 7, the for unfolding is 12.2 kcal/mol, with the midpoint of the transition at 0.99 M gdn-HCl and m = 12.3 kcal/(mol.M). Thus, pelC is unusually stable and has an m value that is much larger than for typical globular proteins. Thermal denaturation of pelC has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and by CD. Although thermal denaturation is not reversible, valid thermodynamic data can be obtained for the unfolding transition. DeltaH(van't Hoff)/DeltaH(cal) is less than 1 for pHs between 5 and 8, with a maximum value of 0.91 at pH 7 decreasing to 0.85 at pH 8 and to 0.68 at pH 5. At all pHs studied, the excess heat capacity can be deconvoluted into two components corresponding to two-state transitions that are nearly coincident at pH 7, but deviate more at higher and lower pH. Thus, pelC appears to consist of two domains that interact strongly and unfold in a cooperative fashion at pH 7, but the cooperativity decreases at higher and lower pH. The crystal structure of pelC shows no obvious domain structure, however.",

Tryptophan fluorescence of wild type enzyme and an N-terminally truncated form (N55) increased at low concentrations of urea or guanidine-HCl followed by a reduction in intensity at intermediate denaturant concentrations; a transition at higher denaturant was detected as decreased fluorescence intensity and a red-shifted emission. Solute quenching of fluorescence indicated that tryptophans become progressively solvent-exposed during unfolding. Wild type enzyme had stronger negative CD bands between 220 and 230 nm than the mutant, indicative of greater alpha-helical content. Urea or guanidine-HCl caused a reduction in ellipticity at 222 nm at low denaturant concentration with the wild type enzyme, a transition that is absent in the mutant; both enzymes exhibited a cooperative transition at higher denaturant concentrations. Both enzymes dissociate to monomers in 1.5 m urea. Unfolding of wild type enzyme is described by a multistate unfolding and a parallel two state unfolding; the two-state component is absent in the mutant. Changes in spectral properties associated with unfolding were largely reversible after dilution to low denaturant. Unfolding of glycyl-tRNA synthetase is complex with a native state, a native-like monomer, partially unfolded states, and the unfolded state.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium denaturation of dimeric mouse beta-nerve growth factor (beta-NGF) has been studied by monitoring changes in the protein's spectroscopic characteristics. Denaturation of beta-NGF in guanidine hydrochloride and urea resulted in an altered intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum, fluorescence depolarization, and diminished negative circular dichroism. Native-like spectroscopic properties and specific biological activity are restored when denaturant is diluted from unfolded samples, demonstrating that this process is fully reversible. However, refolding of denatured beta-NGF is dependent on the three disulfide bonds present in the native protein and does not readily occur when the disulfide bonds are reduced. Graphical analysis and nonlinear least-squares fitting of beta-NGF denaturation data demonstrate that denaturation is dependent on the concentration of beta-NGF and is consistent with a two-state model involving native dimer and denatured monomer (N2 = 2D). The conformational stability of mouse beta-NGF calculated according to this model is 19.3 +/- 1.1 kcal/mol in 100 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7. Increasing the hydrogen ion concentration resulted in a 25% decrease in beta-NGF stability at pH 4 relative to pH 7.",

        "abstract": "We have recently concluded from the heat-induced denaturation studies that polyols do not affect deltaG(D) degrees (the Gibbs free energy change (deltaG(D)) at 25 degrees C) of ribonuclease-A and lysozyme at physiological pH and temperature, and their stabilizing effect increases with decrease in pH. Since the estimation of deltaG(D) degrees of proteins from heat-induced denaturation curves requires a large extrapolation, the reliability of this procedure for the estimation of deltaG(D) degrees is always questionable, and so are conclusions drawn from such studies. This led us to measure deltaG(D) degrees of ribonuclease-A and lysozyme using a more accurate method, i.e., from their isothermal (25 degrees C) guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced denaturations. We show that our earlier conclusions drawn from heat-induced denaturation studies are correct. Since the extent of unfolding of heat- and GdmCl-induced denatured states of these proteins is not identical, the extent of stabilization of the proteins by polyols against heat and GdmCl denaturations may also differ. We report that in spite of the differences in the structural nature of the heat- and GdmCl-denatured states of each protein, the extent of stabilization by a polyol is same. We also report that the functional dependence of deltaG(D) of proteins in the presence of polyols on denaturant concentration is linear through the full denaturant concentration range. Furthermore, polyols do not affect the secondary and tertiary structures of the native and GdmCl-denatured states.",

        "abstract": "Protein folding barriers result from a combination of factors including unavoidable energetic frustration from nonnative interactions, natural variation and selection of the amino acid sequence for function, and/or selection pressure against aggregation. The rate-limiting step for human Pin1 WW domain folding is the formation of the loop 1 substructure. The native conformation of this six-residue loop positions side chains that are important for mediating protein-protein interactions through the binding of Pro-rich sequences. Replacement of the wild-type loop 1 primary structure by shorter sequences with a high propensity to fold into a type-I' beta-turn conformation or the statistically preferred type-I G1 bulge conformation accelerates WW domain folding by almost an order of magnitude and increases thermodynamic stability. However, loop engineering to optimize folding energetics has a significant downside: it effectively eliminates WW domain function according to ligand-binding studies. The energetic contribution of loop 1 to ligand binding appears to have evolved at the expense of fast folding and additional protein stability. Thus, the two-state barrier exhibited by the wild-type human Pin1 WW domain principally results from functional requirements, rather than from physical constraints inherent to even the most efficient loop formation process.",

        "abstract": "Fur (ferric uptake regulator) is a key bacterial protein that regulates iron acquisition and its storage, and modulates the expression of genes involved in the response to different environmental stresses. Although the protein is involved in several regulation mechanisms, and members of the Fur family have been identified in pathogen organisms, the stability and thermodynamic characterization of a Fur protein have not been described. In this work, the stability, thermodynamics and structure of the functional dimeric Fur A from Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 were studied by using computational methods and different biophysical techniques, namely, circular dichroism, fluorescence, Fourier-transform infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. The structure, as monitored by circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared, was composed of a 40% of alpha-helix. Chemical-denaturation experiments indicated that Fur A folded via a two-state mechanism, but its conformational stability was small with a value of DeltaG = 5.3 +/- 0.3 kcal mol(-1) at 298 K. Conversely, Fur A was thermally a highly stable protein. The high melting temperature (Tm = 352 +/- 5 K), despite its moderate conformational stability, can be ascribed to its low heat capacity change upon unfolding, DeltaCp, which had a value of 0.8 +/- 0.1 kcal mol(-1) K(-1). This small value is probably due to burial of polar residues in the Fur A structure. This feature can be used for the design of mutants of Fur A with impaired DNA-binding properties.",

Under conditions wherein alpha denatures at 45.8 degrees C, beta denatures at 53.6 degrees. The homologous chicken beta isoform known as CPV3 also exhibits heightened stability-prompting an inquiry into the stabilizing influence of Pro-21 and Pro-26. Individual P21A and P26A mutations lower the T(m) of rat beta by 3.2 degrees, decreasing conformational stability by 0.74 kcal/mol. Simultaneous replacement of Pro-21 and Pro-26 essentially abolishes the excess stability (DeltaT(m) = -7.6 degrees; DeltaDeltaG(conf) = -1.77 kcal/mol). Significantly, the P21A/P26A variant displays Ca(2+) affinity virtually indistinguishable from wild-type beta, implying that structural alterations in the AB domain do not necessarily influence the divalent ion affinity of the CD-EF domain. The consequences of introducing proline at positions 21 and 26 in rat alpha were also examined. Whereas the H26P mutation raises the T(m) by 5.6 degrees (DeltaDeltaG(conf) = 1.25 kcal/mol), A21P lowers the T(m) by 8.5 degrees (DeltaDeltaG(conf) = -1.9 kcal/mol). Replacement of Ala-21 by proline in an alpha AB/beta CD-EF chimera increases the T(m) by 5.8 degrees (DeltaDeltaG(conf) = 0.95 kcal/mol), implying that the destabilization of alpha by Pro-21 results from steric conflict with a residue in the CD-EF domain. Consistent with that hypothesis, the K80S mutation markedly stabilizes alpha A21P, yielding a protein with a T(m) 2.0 degrees higher than wild-type alpha. The observed differences in stability resulting from proline addition/removal are largely consistent with alterations in main-chain and side-chain conformational entropy.",

According to gel filtration, this protein, its truncated forms, and/or its variants are homodimeric under physiologic conditions (pH 6-7, 0.1 M NaCl). The dimer if monomer equilibrium shifts toward a prevalent monomeric form at pH <4.5. Velocity sedimentation reveals a monomeric state of OBP at both pH 7.2 and 3.5, indicating a pressure-induced dissociation of the homodimer. High-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (HS-DSC) shows that the unfolding transition of pOBP is reversible at neutral pH. It is characterized by the transition temperature of 69.23 degrees C and an enthalpy of 391.1 kJ/mol per monomer. The transition heat capacity curve of pOBP is well-approximated by the two-state model on the level of subunit, indicating that the two monomers behave independently. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) shows that at physiological pH pOBP binds 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) and 3,7-dimethyloctan-1-ol (DMO) with association constants of 3.19 x 10(6) and 4.94 x 10(6) M(-)(1) and enthalpies of -97.2 and -87.8 kJ/mol, respectively. The binding stoichiometry of both ligands is nearly one molecule of ligand per homodimer of pOBP. The interaction of pOBP with both ligands is enthalpically driven with an unfavorable change of entropy. The binding affinity of pOBP with IBMP does not change significantly at acidic pH, while the binding stoichiometry is nearly halved. According to HS-DSC data, the interaction with IBMP and DMO leads to a substantial stabilization of the pOBP folded structure, which is manifested by the increase in the unfolding temperature and enthalpy. The calorimetric data allow us to conclude that the mechanism of binding of the studied odorants to pOBP is not dominated by a hydrophobic effect related to any change in the hydration state of protein and ligand groups but, most likely, is driven by polar and van der Waals interactions.",

Valine 131, within alpha-helix 126-134, was identified as a potential candidate. Its side-chain rotational angle, chi 1, differs by approximately 18 degrees from the low-energy trans configuration. In addition, it is largely solvent exposed, yet is held in a rigid conformation. The mutant protein with Val 131 replaced by alanine was constructed and found to have a melting temperature 0.9 degrees C higher than that of wild-type lysozyme at pH 2.8. As a control, the mutant Val 131----Thr was also constructed and its melting temperature was found to be marginally lower than wild type. High-resolution crystal structure determinations of the mutant lysozymes show that their structures are virtually identical with that of wild-type lysozyme, except for the Val----Ala or Val----Thr replacement. Analysis of the different structures suggests that the design of the Val----Ala substitution was, in principle, successful, although the apparent gain in stability caused by reduction in strain is modest and is somewhat offset by the loss of hydrophobic interactions and by entropic effects. The results also help to provide a structural rationalization for the experimental and empirical observations that alanine has a higher helix propensity than valine or threonine.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding of human plasma alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) induced by heat or guanidine hydrochloride was studied under equilibrium conditions. In thermal unfolding, an intermediate state was detected by the appearance of unusual positive difference absorption bands in the 287-295-nm region, which occurred at lower temperatures than the common denaturation bands at 284 and 291 nm. The formation of this intermediate species apparently involves a local conformational change that perturbs the environment of tryptophyl residues, without affecting the secondary structure of the protein as judged from circular dichroism spectra. On the other hand, denaturation of the glycoprotein induced by guanidine hydrochloride seemed to follow a two-state model with no evidence of any intermediate species; however, the analysis of the transition curve indicated that the change in the accessibility to solvent of amino acid residues of AGP upon unfolding is significantly lower than those observed for other proteins. According to these results, it is proposed that part of the polypeptide chain in native AGP, namely, that from residue 122 to the C-terminus, may be \"loosely\" folded.",

        "abstract": "Correct selection of domain boundaries is critical for structural analysis of single domains from multimodular proteins. Folding and stability studies of the third fibronectin type III domain from human tenascin (TNfn31-90) have shown that it is moderately stable (Delta G(D-N)(H2O) approximately 5 kcal mol-1) and folds with two-state kinetics. In an attempt to stabilize the protein, five domains were constructed with different combinations of extensions to the N- and C-termini. Thermal denaturation studies show that a specific two amino acid (Gly-Leu) extension at the C-terminus is primarily responsible for a significant increase in stability. The Delta Delta G(D-N)(H2O) of the Gly-Leu extension (TNfn3(1-92)) is 2.7 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1. Refolding kinetics do not differ significantly, but unfolding is slowed 40-fold. Mutation of leucine 92 to alanine does not affect stability, indicating that the stability of the extension does not come from the packing of the leucine side chain. Hydrogen exchange data suggest that the extension adds new hydrogen bonds and strengthens existing hydrogen bonds in the C-terminal interaction with the A-B and E-F loops. Removal of a very small number of hydrogen bonds substantially increases the unfolding rate, a phenomenon which may be important in stress-relaxation of FNIII-containing muscle proteins such as titin. These experiments demonstrate the importance of a small number of additional long-range interactions in the overall formation of a compact independently folding beta-sheet module.",

        "abstract": "Most proteins contain small cavities that can be filled by replacing cavity-lining residues by larger ones. Since shortening mutations in hydrophobic cores tend to destabilize proteins, it is expected that cavity-filling mutations may conversely increase protein stability. We have filled three small cavities in apoflavodoxin and determined by NMR and equilibrium unfolding analysis their impact in protein structure and stability. The smallest cavity (14 A3) has been filled, at two different positions, with a variety of residues and, in all cases, the mutant proteins are locally unfolded, their structure and energetics resembling those of an equilibrium intermediate of the thermal unfolding of the wild-type protein. In contrast, two slightly larger cavities of 20 A3 and 21 A3 have been filled with Val to Ile or Val to Leu mutations and the mutants preserve both the native fold and the equilibrium unfolding mechanism. From the known relationship, observed in shortening mutations, between stability changes and the differential hydrophobicity of the exchanged residues and the volume of the cavities, the filling of these apoflavodoxin cavities is expected to stabilize the protein by approximately 1.5 kcal mol(-1). However, both urea and thermal denaturation analysis reveal much more modest stabilizations, ranging from 0.0 kcal mol(-1) to 0.6 kcal mol(-1), which reflects that the accommodation of single extra methyl groups in small cavities requires some rearrangement, necessarily destabilizing, that lowers the expected theoretical stabilization. As the size of these cavities is representative of that of the typical small, empty cavities found in most proteins, it seems unlikely that filling this type of cavities will give rise to large stabilizations.",

        "abstract": "One unique aspect of cytochrome c folding concerns the involvement of the covalently attached heme group and its axial ligands. To elucidate the role of the ligands in stabilizing the native and molten globule states, we studied the conformational and thermodynamic features of the iron-free derivative of horse cyctochrome c (porphyrin-cytochrome c). At neutral pH, far-UV circular dichroism suggested that porphyrin-cytochrome c has native-like alpha-helices, whereas near-UV CD suggested that the side-chains are flexible. Its stability against heat or denaturants was much less than that of the intact protein, and similar to that of the acidic molten globule state of the holoprotein. These results indicate that, at neutral pH, the ligation of His18 of the iron is important for the maintenance of the native structure whereas the Met80 ligation is not essential, and that porphyrin-cytochrome c assumes a molten globule-like state. Porphyrin-cytochrome c was largely unfolded at pH 2.0 in the absence of salt, but assumed another molten globule-like structure in the presence of anions. The salt-induced stabilization of the molten globule-like state was the same as that of apocytochrome c, requiring a much higher salt concentration than holocytochrome c. These results indicate that, at acidic pH, the His18 ligation is important, although not essential, for stabilizing the molten globule state. Taken together, both specific (i.e. the His18 axial ligand, as observed at acidic pH) and nonspecific interactions (the hydrophobic effects of the heme, as observed at neutral pH) contribute to stabilizing the molten globule state.",

For multiple mutants, additive effects on stability were observed, providing mutants up to 7.8 degrees C more stable than the wild-type. None of the introduced mutations affected any FGF-1 biological activities, such as stimulation of DNA synthesis, MAP kinase activation and binding to the FGF receptor on the cell surface.

The mutation sites (Thr29, Ala30 and Thr33) have been chosen on the basis of comparison of the amino acid sequences of goat, bovine and gunea pig alpha-lactalbumin, in which the guinea pig protein shows a remarkably more stable molten globule than the other proteins. The recombinant proteins were expressed Escherichia coli and then purified and refolded efficiently to produce the active proteins. The stability of the molten globule state of these engineered proteins has been investigated by urea-induced unfolding transition under an acidic condition (pH 2.0), where the molten globule state is stable in the absence of urea. The results show that the molten globule state is stabilized by the amino acid substitutions which raise the hydrophobicity of the residues, suggesting that the hydrophobic core in a globular protein plays an important role in the stability of the molten globule state. The change in stabilization free energy of the molten globule state caused by each amino acid substitution has been evaluated, and molecular mechanisms of stabilization of the molten globule state are discussed.",

While previous studies have provided invaluable insight into the effect of crowding on the stability and folding rate of protein tertiary structures, very little is known about how crowding affects protein folding dynamics at the secondary structure level. In this study, we examined the thermal stability and folding-unfolding kinetics of three small folding motifs (i.e., a 34-residue alpha-helix, a 34-residue cross-linked helix-turn-helix, and a 16-residue beta-hairpin) in the presence of two commonly used crowding agents, Dextran 70 (200 g/L) and Ficoll 70 (200 g/L). We found that these polymers do not induce any appreciable changes in the folding kinetics of the two helical peptides, which is somewhat surprising as the helix-coil transition kinetics have been shown to depend on viscosity. Also to our surprise and in contrast to what has been observed for larger proteins, we found that crowding leads to an appreciable decrease in the folding rate of the shortest beta-hairpin peptide, indicating that besides the excluded volume effect, other factors also need to be considered when evaluating the net effect of crowding on protein folding kinetics. A model considering both the static and the dynamic effects arising from the presence of the crowding agent is proposed to rationalize these results.",

The results show that Zn(II)-binding largely stabilizes the structure of endostatin at physiological pH. Under some proteolytic conditions, Zn(II)-binding also contributes to the integrity of the N-terminus of endostatin, which is critical for endostatin to maintain a stable structure. Moreover, engineering an extra Zn(II)-binding peptide to the N-terminus of human endostatin makes this molecule more stable and cooperative in the presence of Zn(II).",

        "abstract": "To clarify the structural role of Phe46 inside the hydrophobic core of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A), thermal and pressure unfolding of wild-type RNase A and three mutant forms (F46V, F46E, and F46K) were analyzed by fourth-derivative UV absorbance spectroscopy. All the mutants, as well as the wild type, exhibited a two-state transition during both thermal and pressure unfolding, and both T(m) and P(m) decreased markedly when Phe46 was replaced with valine, glutamic acid, or lysine. The strongest effect was on the F46K mutant and the weakest on F46V. Both unfolding processes produced identical blue shifts in the fourth-derivative spectra, indicating that the tyrosine residues are similarly exposed in the temperature- and pressure-induced unfolded states. A comparison of Gibbs free energies determined from the pressure and temperature unfoldings, however, gave DeltaG(p)/DeltaG(t) ratios (r) of 1.7 for the wild type and 0.92 +/- 0.03 for the mutants. Furthermore, the DeltaV value for each mutant was larger than that for the wild type. CD spectra and activity measurements showed no obvious major structural differences in the folded state, indicating that the structures of the Phe46 mutants and wild type differ in the unfolded state. We propose a model in which Phe46 stabilizes the hydrophobic core at the boundary between two structural domains. Mutation of Phe46 decreases protein stability by weakening the unfolding cooperativity between these domains. This essential function of Phe46 in RNase A stability indicates that it belongs to a chain-folding initiation site.",

Through mutagenesis and biophysical analysis, we have probed the conformational stability of the F-helix, demonstrating that it is almost completely unfolded in the intermediate state. The replacement of Tyr160 on the F-helix of alpha1-antitrypsin to alanine results in the loss of a conserved hydrogen bond that dramatically reduces the stability of the protein to both heat and solvent denaturation, indicating the importance of Tyr160 in the stability of the molecule. The mutation of Tyr160 to a tryptophan residue, within a fluorescently silent variant of alpha1-antitrypsin, results in a fully active, stable serpin. Fluorescence analysis of the equilibrium unfolding behavior of this variant indicates that the F-helix is highly disrupted in the intermediate conformation. Iodide quenching experiments demonstrate that the tryptophan residue is exposed to a similar extent in both the intermediate and unfolded states. Cumulatively, these data indicate that the F-helix plays an important role in controlling the early conformational changes involved in alpha1-antitrypsin unfolding.

These surface substitutions stabilize the N-terminal alpha-helix of the A chain, a key element of hormone-receptor recognition. Does enhanced stability necessarily imply enhanced activity? Here, we test by structure-based mutagenesis the relationship between the stability and activity of the hormone. To circumvent confounding effects of insulin self-association, A chain analogs were combined with a variant B chain (Asp(B10), Lys(B28), and Pro(B29) (DKP)) to create a monomeric template. Five analogs were obtained by chain combination; disulfide pairing proceeded in each case with native yield. CD and (1)H NMR spectra of the DKP analogs are essentially identical to those of DKP-insulin, indicating a correspondence of structures. Receptor binding affinities were determined by competitive displacement of (125)I-insulin from human placental membranes. Thermodynamic stabilities were measured by CD titration; unfolding was monitored as a function of guanidine concentration. In this broader collection of analogs receptor binding affinities are uncorrelated with stability. We suggest that receptor binding affinities of A8 analogs reflect local features of the hormone-receptor interface rather than the stability of the free hormone or the intrinsic C-capping propensity of the A8 side chain.",

E. (1989) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 5, 183]. Glu 43 is located at the base of the solvent-exposed and conformationally mobile omega-loop in the active site of E43 SNase having the sequence Glu43-Thr44-Lys45-His46-Pro47-Lys48- Lys49-Gly50-Val51-Glu52, where the gamma-carboxylate of Glu 52 is hydrogen bonded to the amide hydrogen of Glu 43. With a metabolic selection for SNase activity produced in an Escherichia coli host, we detected an unexpected deletion of residues 44-49 of the omega-loop of E43 SNase in cassette mutagenesis experiments designed to randomize codons 44 and 45 in the omega-loop and increase the activity of the previously described E43D mutation (D43 SNase). A high-resolution X-ray structure of D43 SNase has revealed that the E43D substitution significantly changes the structure of the omega-loop, reduces the interaction of the essential Ca2+ ion with its active-site ligands, and diminishes the network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules in the active site [Loll, P., & Lattman, E. E. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 6866]. This deletion of six amino acids from the omega-loop generates a protein (E43 delta SNase) having a partially solvent-exposed, surface beta-turn with the sequence Glu43-Gly50-Val51-Glu52; the structure of this beta-turn is addressed in the following article [Baldisseri et al.

To address this point, we have constructed a concatamer of five mutant I27 domains (denoted (I27)(5)*) and used it for mechanical unfolding studies. This protein consists of four copies of the mutant C47S, C63S I27 and a single copy of C63S I27. These mutations severely destabilize I27 (DeltaDeltaG(UN) = 8.7 and 17.9 kJ mol(-1) for C63S I27 and C47S, C63S I27, respectively). Both mutations maintain the hydrogen bond network between the A' and G strands postulated to be the major region of mechanical resistance for I27. Measuring the speed dependence of the force required to unfold (I27)(5)* in triplicate using the atomic force microscope allowed a reliable assessment of the intrinsic unfolding rate constant of the protein to be obtained (2.0 x 10(-3) s(-1)). The rate constant of unfolding measured by chemical denaturation is over fivefold faster (1.1 x 10(-2) s(-1)), suggesting that these techniques probe different unfolding pathways. Also, by comparing the parameters obtained from the mechanical unfolding of a wild-type I27 concatamer with that of (I27)(5)*, we show that although the observed forces are considerably lower, core destabilization has little effect on determining the mechanical sensitivity of this domain.",

The DSC estimates for the conformational free energy at pH 8 and 298 K are compared to earlier results from isothermal acid and guanidinium chloride unfolding. Stability estimates at pH 8 for these six metmyoglobins obtained by DSC experiments do not agree with free energy estimates at pH 8 from guanidinium chloride unfolding. This is true for all three models used to extrapolate the free energy change to 0 M guanidinium chloride. Among these six myoglobins, significant variation appears in the temperature at which the myoglobin is half-unfolded, in the change in heat capacity upon unfolding, and in the change in enthalpy at 310 K. Calculations made with the hydrophobic model for protein folding [Baldwin, R.L. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These data, in conjunction with previously obtained stabilities of the corresponding alanine mutants, unequivocally show that the dominant contribution to stability for virtually all of the wild-type side chains examined is the electrostatic effect associated with each residue's charged group. With only a few exceptions, these charges stabilize the native state, with an average loss of 0.5 kcal/mol of stability upon neutralization of a charge. When the charge is reversed, the average destabilization is doubled. Structure-based calculations of electrostatic free energy with the continuum method based on the finite difference solution to the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation reproduce the observed energetics when the polarizability in the protein interior is represented with a dielectric constant of 20. However, in some cases, large differences are found, giving insight into possible areas for improvement of the calculations. In particular, it appears that the assumptions made in the calculations about the absence of electrostatic interactions in the denatured state and the energetic consequences of dynamic fluctuations in the native state will have to be further explored.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial luciferase is a heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of reduced FMN, O2 and an aliphatic aldehyde to yield the carboxylic acid and an excited flavin that emits blue-green light upon return to ground state. The two subunits of the luciferase from Vibrio harveyi, alpha and beta, have molecular weights of 40,108 and 36.349, respectively; the single active center resides primarily, if not exclusively, on the alpha subunit. We have found that bacterial luciferase can be unfolded in urea-containing 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and refolded by dilution of the urea with final luciferase concentrations of 5-25 micrograms/ml. We have analyzed the urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of bacterial luciferase by monitoring changes in both the far ultraviolet circular dichroism (predominantly secondary structure) and intrinsic fluorescence emission (predominantly tertiary structure) resulting from incubation in various concentrations of urea at 18 degrees C for 18-24 h. Both spectral methods indicated a biphasic unfolding transition; the first phase was protein concentration-independent, whereas the second phase was protein concentration-dependent. Equilibrium unfolding curves showed an increase in fluorescence up to 2 M urea followed by a decrease in intensity and red shift of the emission maximum. The ratio of the fluorescence emission in the presence of 2 M urea relative to that in the absence of urea was greater when fluorescence was excited at 295 nm than at 280 nm. The fluorescence increase in the 0-2 M urea range corresponded to the first phase of the biphasic unfolding process. The urea-induced loss of luciferase enzymatic activity appeared to correspond to the first transition observed with the spectroscopic methods, and likewise to be protein concentration-independent. These observations suggested a three-state unfolding mechanism in which the native heterodimeric enzyme rearranges to an inactive heterodimeric species that is well populated, followed by dissociation and unfolding of the alpha and beta subunits. The data were fit to a three-state mechanism using a nonlinear least squares method. At 18 degrees C in 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, the free energy change for the interconversion of the active heterodimer and the inactive heterodimeric species was estimated to be 4.52 +/- 0.30 kcal/mol; the free energy change for the interconversion of the inactive heterodimer and the individual subunits was 19.7 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The P22 tailspike protein folds by forming a folding competent monomer species that forms a dimeric, then a non-native trimeric (protrimer) species by addition of folding competent monomers. We have found three residues, R549, R563, and D572, which play a critical role in both the stability of the native tailspike protein and assembly and maturation of the protrimer. King and colleagues reported previously that substitution of R563 to glutamine inhibited protrimer formation. We now show that the R549Q and R563K variants significantly delay the protrimer-to-trimer transition both in vivo and in vitro. Previously, variants that destabilize intermediates have shown wild-type chemical stability. Interestingly, both the R549Q and R563K variants destabilize the tailspike trimer in guanidine denaturation studies, indicating that they represent a new class of tailspike folding variants. R549Q has a midpoint of unfolding at 3.2M guanidine, compared to 5.6M for the wild-type tailspike protein, while R563K has a midpoint of unfolding of 1.8 M. R549Q and R563K also denature over a broader pH range than the wild-type tailspike protein and both proteins have increased sensitivity to pH during refolding, suggesting that both residues are involved in ionic interactions. Our model is that R563 and D572 interact to stabilize the adjacent turn, aiding the assembly of the dimer and protrimer species. We believe that the interaction between R563 and D572 is also critical following assembly of the protrimer to properly orient D572 in order to form a salt bridge with R549 during protrimer maturation.",

        "abstract": "We have mutated residues in the active site of the ribonuclease, barnase, in order to determine their effects on both enzyme activity and protein stability. Mutation of several of the positively charged residues that interact with the negatively charged RNA substrate (Lys27----Ala, Arg59----Ala and His102----Ala) causes large decreases in activity. This is accompanied, however, by an increase in stability. There is presumably electrostatic strain in the active site where positively charged side-chains are clustered. Mutation of several residues that make hydrogen bonds (Ser57----Ala, Asn58----Asp and Tyr103----Phe) causes smaller decreases in activity, but increases or has no effect on stability. Deletion of hydrogen bonding groups elsewhere in proteins has been found previously to decrease stability by 0.5 to 1.5 kcal mol-1. Conversely, we find that two mutations (Asp54----Asn and Gln104----Ala) decrease stability and increase activity. Another mutation (Glu73----Ala) decreases both activity and stability. It is clear that many residues in the active site do not contribute to stability and that for some, but not all, of the residues there is a compromise between activity and stability. This suggests that certain types of local instability may be necessary for substrate binding and catalysis by barnase. This has implications for the understanding of enzyme activity and the design of enzymes.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium and kinetic folding properties of a small oncogene product, P13(MTCP1), of novel topology have been investigated using perturbation by guanidine hydrochloride and observation by fluorescence, circular dichroism and two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The structure of P13(MTCP1) is comprised of a canonical filled beta-barrel, although the topology of the structure is absolutely unique, rendering the folding properties of this protein of great interest. Equilibrium measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum, the fluorescence decay, the circular dichroism spectrum and the (15)N-(1)H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) correlation spectrum as a function of increasing concentrations of denaturant showed no evidence for the population of any equilibrium intermediates, although negative amplitudes on the blue edge of the tryptophan emission and loss of intensity of the native HSQC correlation peaks were indicative of increased conformational dynamics at low denaturant concentrations. The free energy and cooperativity of unfolding as observed by fluorescence and circular dichroism were in relatively good agreement, also consistent with a two-state transition. Kinetics measurements of the fluorescence emission as a function of denaturant concentration revealed that P13(MTCP1) is the slowest folding beta-structure protein reported to date. Comparison of the activation cooperativity values (m(f) and m(u)) indicates that the structure of the transition state is quite close to the folded state in terms of exposed surface area. The calculated contact order of P13(MTCP1) is relatively low and does not appear to explain its slow rate of folding. We suggest that the complex topology of this protein, which would require the ordering of the beta-barrel through a long loop joining the two L-shaped components of the barrel, could provide an explanation for this slow folding.",

        "abstract": "The yeast non-Mendelian factor [URE3] propagates by a prion-like mechanism, involving aggregation of the chromosomally encoded protein Ure2. The [URE3] phenotype is equivalent to loss of function of Ure2, a protein involved in regulation of nitrogen metabolism. The prion-like behaviour of Ure2 in vivo is dependent on the first 65 amino acid residues of its N-terminal region which contains a highly repetitive sequence rich in asparagine. This region has been termed the prion-determining domain (PrD). Removal of as little as residues 2-20 of the protein is sufficient to prevent occurrence of the [URE3] phenotype. Removal of the PrD does not affect the regulatory activity of Ure2. The C-terminal portion of the protein has homology to glutathione S -transferases, which are dimeric proteins. We have produced the Ure2 protein to high yield in Escherichia coli from a synthetic gene. The recombinant purified protein is shown to be a dimer. The stability, folding and oligomeric state of Ure2 and a series of N-terminally truncated or deleted variants were studied and compared. The stability of Ure2, DeltaGD-N, H2O, determined by chemical denaturation and monitored by fluorescence, is 12.1(+/-0.4) kcal mol-1at 25 degrees C and pH 8.4. A range of structural probes show a single, coincident unfolding transition, which is invariant over a 550-fold change in protein concentration. The stability is the same within error for Ure2 variants lacking all or part of the prion-determining domain. The data indicate that in the folded protein the PrD is in an unstructured conformation and does not form specific intra- or intermolecular interactions at micromolar protein concentrations. This suggests that the C-terminal domain may stabilise the PrD against prion formation by steric means, and implies that the PrD does not induce prion formation by altering the thermodynamic stability of the folded protein.",

        "abstract": "Anabaena apoflavodoxin contains a single histidine residue (H34) that interacts with two aromatic residues (F7 and Y47). The histidine and phenylalanine rings are almost coplanar and they can establish a cation-pi interaction when the histidine is protonated. The histidine and tyrosine side-chains are engaged in a hydrogen bond, which is their only contact. We analyse the energetics of these interactions using p Ka-shift analysis, double-mutant cycle analysis at two pH values, and X-ray crystallography. The H/F interaction is very weak when the histidine is neutral, but it is strengthened by 0.5 kcal mol-1on histidine protonation. Supporting this fact, the histidine p Kain a F7L mutant is 0.4 pH units lower than in wild-type. The strength of the H/Y hydrogen bond is 0.7 kcal mol-1when the histidine is charged, and it becomes stronger (1.3 kcal mol-1) when the histidine is neutral. This is consistent with our observation that the (H34)Nepsilon2-OH(Y47) distance is slightly shorter in the apoflavodoxin structure at pH 9.0 than in the previously reported structure at pH 6.0. It is also consistent with a histidine p Kavalue 0.6 pH units higher in a Y47F mutant than in the wild-type protein. We suggest that the higher stability of the neutral hydrogen bond could be due to a higher desolvation penalty of the charged hydrogen bond that would offset its more favourable enthalpy of formation. The relationship between hydrogen bond strength and the contribution of hydrogen bonds to protein stability is discussed.",

        "abstract": "FepA is an integral outer membrane protein that is the specific receptor for the siderophore, ferric enterobactin, and is thus primarily responsible for iron uptake in many Gram-negative bacteria. A site-specific mutant of FepA, containing a single introduced cysteine in the ligand-binding domain, was spin labeled and used to examine the denaturant-induced unfolding of this receptor with guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and urea. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra showed conversion of the spin label from a motionally-restricted, immobilized environment to a freely-accessible, rotationally-mobile state upon denaturation. Unfolding was also followed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), which is sensitive to loss of the putative transmembrane beta-structure, and displayed a similar concentration dependence. Unfolding occurred over relatively narrow ranges of denaturant concentration, indicating a high degree of cooperativity. Unfolding was fully reversible under the conditions employed. Rapid, spontaneous refolding occurred in the presence of Triton X-100 and did not require exogenous lipids. Refolding could be induced by either dialysis, dilution to low denaturant concentration, or ethanol precipitation. At ambient temperature the free energy of unfolding extrapolated to zero denaturant concentration (delta GU zero) was 6.24 +/- 0.63 kcal/mol. Values of delta GU zero obtained with Gdn-HCl and urea were in good agreement, as were values obtained from linear extrapolation and nonlinear regression fitting to a two-state equilibrium. This is the first report of a quantitative evaluation of the free energy of unfolding for an integral membrane protein.",

Here we show that cysteine quenching dynamics also provide a novel method for measuring folding rates when the exchange between folded and unfolded states is faster than the unquenched triplet lifetime (approximately 100 micros). We use this technique to investigate folding/unfolding kinetics of the 35 residue headpiece subdomain of the protein villin, which contains a single tryptophan residue and was engineered to contain a cysteine residue at the N terminus. At intermediate concentrations of denaturant the time-course of the triplet decay consists of two relaxations, the rates and amplitudes of which reveal the fast kinetics for folding and unfolding of this protein. The folding rates extracted using a simple kinetic model are close to those reported previously from laser-induced temperature-jump experiments that employ the change in tryptophan fluorescence as a probe. However, the results differ significantly from those reported from dynamic NMR line shape analysis on a variant with methionine at the N terminus, an issue that remains to be resolved. The analysis of the triplet quenching kinetics also shows that the quenching rates in the unfolded state increase with decreasing denaturant concentration, indicating a compaction of the unfolded protein.",

The compactness of the fragment whose intrachain disulfide bond was reduced in order for the tryptophan residue to fluoresce (reduced CL-AEDANS fragment) was studied in the early stages of refolding from 4 M guanidine hydrochloride by fluorescence energy transfer from Trp 148 to the AEDANS group. The AEDANS group attached to the SH group of a cysteine scarcely fluoresced when excited at 295 nm. For the reduced CL-AEDANS fragment, the fluorescence emission band of the Trp residue overlapped with the absorption band of the AEDANS group, and the fluorescence energy transfer was observed between Trp 148 and the AEDANS group in the absence of guanidine hydrochloride. In 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, the distance between the donor and the acceptor was larger, and the efficiency of the energy transfer became lower. The distance between Trp 148 and the AEDANS group for the intact protein estimated by using the energy-transfer data was in good agreement with that obtained by X-ray crystallographic analysis. By the use of fluorescence energy transfer, tryptophyl fluorescence, and circular dichroism at 218 nm, the kinetics of unfolding and refolding of the reduced fragment were studied. These three methods gave the same unfolding kinetic pattern. However, the refolding kinetics measured by fluorescence energy transfer were different from those measured by tryptophyl fluorescence and circular dichroism, the latter two giving the same kinetic pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Native-state proteolysis offers a facile way to investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic accessibilities of partially unfolded forms (cleavable forms) under native conditions. However, determination of the structure of the cleavable form, which is populated only transiently, remains challenging. Although in some cases partially cleaved products from proteolysis provide information on the structure of this elusive form, proteolysis of many proteins does not accumulate detectable intermediates. Here, we describe a systematic approach to determining structures of cleavable forms by protein engineering and native-state proteolysis. By devising phi(c) analysis, which is analogous to conventional phi analysis, we have determined the structure of the cleavable form of Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), which does not accumulate any partially cleaved products. We mutated 10 buried residues in MBP to alanine and determined phi(c) values from the effects of the mutations on global stability and proteolytic susceptibility. The result of this analysis suggests that two C-terminal helices in MBP are unfolded in their cleavable form. The effect of ligand binding on proteolytic susceptibility and C-terminal deletion mutations also confirms the proposed structure. Our approach and methodology are generally applicable not only in elucidating the mechanism of proteolysis but also in investigating other important processes involving partial unfolding under native conditions such as protein misfolding and aggregation.",

We have found that the A-state of nuclease at pH 2.1 in the presence of moderate to high salt concentrations and at low temperature exists in a substantially folded form structurally more similar to a native state. The A-state has the far-UV circular dichroism spectra characteristic of the native protein, which indicates that it has a large degree of secondary structure. Upon heating, the A-state denatures with a sigmoidal change in far-UV ellipticity and an observable peak in a differential scanning calorimeter trace, indicating that it is thermodynamically distinct from the denatured state. Three different mutations in a residue normally buried in the protein's core stabilize or destabilize the A-state in the same way as they affect the denaturation of the native state. The A-state must, therefore, contain at least some tertiary packing of side chains. Unlike the native state, which shows cold denaturation at low temperatures, the A-state is most stable at temperatures below 0 degrees C.",

The denatured state of staphylococcal nuclease at pH 8.0 and high temperature has a heat capacity consistent with a fully unfolded protein completely exposed to solvent. At lower pH values, however, the heat capacity of the denatured state is lower, resulting in a lower delta Cp and delta H for the denaturation reaction. The acid-denatured protein can thus be distinguished from a completely unfolded protein by a defined difference in enthalpy and heat capacity. Comparison of circular dichroism spectra suggests that the low heat capacity of the acid-denatured protein does not result from residual helical secondary structure.

Although it has been mentioned that Cys126 and other nearby residues are required to maintain the active site geometry optimal for catalysis, no evidence supporting this idea has been reported to date. In this work, we studied the catalytic and stability properties of mutants C126A and C126S of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TIM (wtTIM). None of these amino acid replacements induced significant changes in the folding of wtTIM, as indicated by spectroscopic studies. C126S and C126A have K(M) and k(cat) values that are concomitantly reduced by only 4-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared to those of wtTIM; in either case, however, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(M)) of the enzyme is barely affected. The affinity of mutated TIMs for the competitive inhibitor 2-phosphoglycolate augmented also slightly. In contrast, greater susceptibility to thermal denaturation resulted from mutation of Cys126, especially when it was changed to Ser. By using values of the rate constants for unfolding and refolding, we estimated that, at 25 degrees C, C126A and C126S are less stable than wtTIM by about 5.0 and 9.0 kcal mol(-)(1), respectively. Moreover, either of these mutations slows down the folding rate by a factor of 10 and decreases the recovery of the active enzyme after thermal unfolding. Thus, Cys126 is required for proper stability and efficient folding of TIM rather than for enzymatic catalysis.",

Human p53 has an unusually low thermodynamic stability and is frequently inactivated by oncogenic missense mutations. Here, we examined the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of p53 DNA binding domains from selected invertebrate and vertebrate species by differential scanning calorimetry and equilibrium urea denaturation. There is a correlation in the apparent melting temperature of p53 with the body temperature of homeotherm vertebrates. We found that p53 from these organisms has a half-life for spontaneous unfolding at organismal body temperature of 10-20 min. We also found that p53 from invertebrates has higher stability, bearing more resemblance towards p63 and p73 from humans. Using structure-guided mutagenesis on the human p53 scaffold, we demonstrated that the amino acid changes on the protein surface and in the protein interior lead to the elevated stability of p53 orthologs. We propose a model in which the p53 DNA binding domain has been shaped by the complex interplay of different selective pressures and underwent adaptive evolution leading to pronounced effects on its stability. p53 from vertebrates has evolved to have a low thermodynamic stability and similarly short spontaneous half-life at organismal body temperature, which is related to function.",

        "abstract": "Small monomeric proteins are the best models for studying protein folding, but they are often too stable for denaturation using pressure as the sole perturbant. In the present work we subject [CI-2(1-40).(41-64)], a noncovalent complex formed by the association of two complementary fragments of the chymotrypsin inhibitor-2, to high pressure to investigate the folding mechanism of a model protein. Pressures up to 3.5 kilobar do not affect the intact protein, but it can be unfolded reversibly by pressure in the presence of subdenaturing concentrations of guanidine chloride, with free energy and molar volume changes of 2.5 kcal mol-1 and 42.5 ml mol-1, respectively. In contrast, the complex can be reversibly denatured by high pressure without the addition of chemical denaturants. However, the process is clearly independent of the protein concentration, indicating lack of dissociation. We determined a change in the free energy of 1.4 kcal mol-1 and a molar volume change of 35 ml mol-1 for the pressure denaturation of the complex. A persistent quenching of the tryptophan adds further evidence for the presence of residual structure in the high pressure-denatured state. This state also appears to be compact as the small volume change indicates, compared with pressure denaturation of naturally occurring dimers. Based on observations of a number of pressure-denatured states and on characteristics of large CI-2 fragments with a solvent accessible core but maintaining tertiary interactions, the structure of the pressure-denatured state of the CI-2 complex could be explained by an ordered molten globule-like conformation.",

        "abstract": "The Hsp70 protein switches during its functional cycle from an ADP-bound state with a high affinity for substrates to a low-affinity, ATP-bound state, with concomitant release of the client protein. The rate of the chaperone cycle is regulated by co-chaperones such as nucleotide exchange factors that significantly accelerate the ADP/ATP exchange. Mge1p, a mitochondrial matrix protein with homology to bacterial GrpE, serves as the nucleotide exchange factor of mitochondrial Hsp70. Here, we analyze the influence of temperature on the structure and functional properties of Mge1p from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mge1p is a dimer in solution that undergoes a reversible thermal transition at heat-shock temperatures, i.e. above 37 degrees C, that involves protein unfolding and dimer dissociation. The thermally denatured protein is unable to interact stably with mitochondrial Hsp70, and therefore is unable to regulate its ATPase and chaperone cycle. Crosslinking of wild-type mitochondria reveals that Mge1p undergoes the same dimer to monomer temperature-dependent shift, and that the nucleotide exchange factor does not associate with its Hsp70 partner at stress temperatures (i.e. > or =45 degrees C). Once the stress conditions disappear, Mge1p refolds and recovers both structure and functional properties. Therefore, Mge1p can act as a thermosensor for the mitochondrial Hsp70 system, regulating the nucleotide exchange rates under heat shock, as has been described for two bacterial GrpE proteins. The thermosensor activity is conserved in the GrpE-like nucleotide exchange factors although, as discussed here, it is achieved through a different structural mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli RNase H folds through a partially folded kinetic intermediate that mirrors a rarely populated, partially unfolded form detectable by native-state hydrogen exchange under equilibrium conditions. Residue 53 is at the interface of two helices known to be structured in this intermediate. Kinetic refolding studies on mutant proteins varying in size and hydrophobicity at residue 53 support a contribution of hydrophobicity to the stabilities of the kinetic intermediate and the transition state. Packing interactions also play a significant role in the stability of these two states, though they play a much larger role in the native-state stability. One dramatic mutation, I53D, results in the conversion from a three-state to a two-state folding mechanism, which is explained most easily through a simple destabilization of the kinetic intermediate such that it is no longer stable with respect to the unfolded state. These results demonstrate that interactions that stabilize an intermediate can accelerate folding if these same interactions are present in the transition state. Our results are consistent with a hierarchical model of folding, where the intermediate consists of native-like interactions, is on-pathway, and is productive for folding.",

It has been observed that guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced denaturation of b-cyt-c follows a two-state mechanism and that of h-cyt-c is not a two-state process. This conclusion is reached from the coincidence and non-coincidence of GdmCl-induced transition curves of bovine and horse proteins, respectively, monitored by measurements of absorbance at 405, 530 and 695 nm and circular dichroism (CD) at 222, 416 and 405 nm. These measurements on h-cyt-c in the presence of GdmCl in the concentration range 0.75-2.0 M also suggest that the protein retains all the native far-UV CD but has slightly perturbed tertiary interaction. The intermediate in the presence of these low denaturant concentrations does not have the structural characteristics of a molten globule as judged by the 8-Anilino-1-napthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) binding and near-UV CD experiments. We have also carried out thermal denaturation studies of bovine and horse cyts-c in the presence of GdmCl monitored by absorbance at 405 nm and far-UV CD at 222 nm. The heat-induced denaturation measurements in the presence of the denaturant show (1) that denaturation of b-cyt-c is a two-state process and that of h-cyt-c does not follow a two-state mechanism, and (2) that the enthalpy change on denaturation of both proteins strongly depends on GdmCl concentration.",

Compared with the holoprotein, apocytochrome P450cam has a reduced helix content. The protein is compact as judged by the Stokes radius and is still able to undergo a two-state transition. However, the enthalpy change at thermal melting is reduced from 980 kJ/mol for the holoprotein to 135 kJ/mol for the apo form. Parts of the molecule have a destabilized tertiary structure. This is indicated by second-derivative spectroscopy, circular dichroism in the near-ultraviolet region, and a high susceptibility to proteolytic digestion. Apocytochrome P450cam is considered a native protein with the extremely low stability of delta G = 7.5 kJ/mol, thus showing at the same time intermediate-like properties.

        "abstract": "The annexins comprise a family of soluble Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding proteins. Although highly similar in three-dimensional structure, different annexins are likely to exhibit different biochemical and functional properties and to play different roles in various membrane related events. Since it must be expected that these functional differences arise from differences in the characteristic thermodynamic parameters of these proteins, we performed high-sensitivity differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) and isothermal guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding studies on annexin I and compared its thermodynamic parameters with those of annexin V published previously. The DSC data were analyzed using a model that permits quantitative treatment of the irreversible reaction. It turned out, however, that provided a heating rate of 2 K min-1 is used, unfolding of annexin I can be described satisfactorily in terms of a simple two-state reaction. At pH 6.0 annexin I is characterized by the following thermodynamic parameters: t1/2=61.8 degrees C, DeltaHcal=824 kJ mol-1 and DeltaCp=19 kJ mol-1 K-1. These parameters result in a stability value of DeltaG0D (20 degrees C)=51 kJ mol-1. The GdnHCl induced isothermal unfolding of annexin I in Mes buffer (pH 6.0), yielded DeltaG0D (buffer) values of 48, 60 and 36 kJ mol-1 at 20, 12 and 5 degrees C, respectively. These DeltaG0D values are in reasonable agreement with the values obtained from the DSC studies. The comparison of annexin I and annexin V under identical conditions (pH 8.0 or pH 6.0) shows that despite the pronounced structural homology of these two members of the annexin familiy, the stability parameters are remarkably different. This difference in stability is consistent with and provides a thermodynamic basis for the potential different in vivo functions proposed for these two annexins.",

        "abstract": "A dominant feature of folding of cytochrome c is the presence of nonnative His-heme kinetic traps, which either pre-exist in the unfolded protein or are formed soon after initiation of folding. The kinetically trapped species can constitute the majority of folding species, and their breakdown limits the rate of folding to the native state. A temperature jump (T-jump) relaxation technique has been used to compare the unfolding/folding kinetics of yeast iso-2 cytochrome c and a genetically engineered double mutant that lacks His-heme kinetic traps, H33N,H39K iso-2. The results show that the thermodynamic properties of the transition states are very similar. A single relaxation time tau(obs) is observed for both proteins by absorbance changes at 287 nm, a measure of solvent exclusion from aromatic residues. At temperatures near Tm, the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transitions, tau(obs) is four to eight times faster for H33N,H39K iso-2 (tau(obs) approximately 4-10 ms) than for iso-2 (tau(obs) approximately 20-30 ms). T-jumps show that there are no kinetically unresolved (tau < 1-3 micros T-jump dead time) \"burst\" phases for either protein. Using a two-state model, the folding (k(f)) and unfolding (k(u)) rate constants and the thermodynamic activation parameters standard deltaGf, standard deltaGu, standard deltaHf, standard deltaHu, standard deltaSf, standard deltaSu are evaluated by fitting the data to a function describing the temperature dependence of the apparent rate constant k(obs) (= tau(obs)(-1)) = k(f) + k(u). The results show that there is a small activation enthalpy for folding, suggesting that the barrier to folding is largely entropic. In the \"new view,\" a purely entropic kinetic barrier to folding is consistent with a smooth funnel folding landscape.",

In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace these structurally strategic residues in CbADH with the corresponding amino acids from TbADH, and we determined the effect of such replacements on the thermal stability of CbADH. Mutations in the intrasubunit ion pair region increased thermostability in the single mutant S254K- and in the double mutant V224E/S254K-CbADH, but not in the single mutant V224E-CbADH. Both single amino acid replacements, M304R- and Q165E-CbADH, in the region of the intersubunit ion pair network augmented thermal stability, with an additive effect in the double mutant M304R/Q165E-CbADH. To investigate the precise mechanism by which such mutations alter the molecular structure of CbADH to achieve enhanced thermostability, we constructed a quadruple mutant V224E/S254K/Q165E/M304R-CbADH and solved its three-dimensional structure. The overall results indicate that the amino acid substitutions in CbADH mutants with enhanced thermal stability reinforce the quaternary structure of the enzyme by formation of an extended network of intersubunit ion pairs and salt bridges, mediated by water molecules, and by forming a new intrasubunit salt bridge.",

In contrast, the angular conformations of the mutated side chains tended to remain unchanged, with torsion angles within 20 degrees of those in the wild-type structure.

Amino acid substitutions E73G and D77G cause losses of the catalytic efficiency of 24 and 16% and cause thermal stability losses of 22 and 26%, respectively, in comparison with the wild type (WT) protein. However, these changes do not significantly change global and local secondary structures, based on measurements of fluorescence and CD(222 nm). Furthermore, x-ray diffraction analysis of the E75G protein shows that the overall structure of mutant and WT proteins is similar. However, this mutation does cause a loss of essential hydrogen bonding and charge interactions between Glu(75) and Lys(9), Tyr(93), and His(121). In experiments using double point mutations, E73G/D77G, E73G/E75G, and E75G/D77G, significant changes are seen in all mutants in comparison with WT protein as measured by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. The losses of thermal stability are 47, 59, and 58%, for E73G/D77G, E73G/E75G, and E75G/D77G, respectively. The triple mutant, E73G/E75G/D77G, results in fluorescence intensity and CD(222 nm) close to those of the denatured state and in a thermal stability loss of 65% relative to the WT protein.

These studies were also extended to the nucleotide-free form of the protein (nfSsEF-1alpha). Interestingly, the experiments show that the denaturation curves of both SsEF-1alpha forms present a single inflection point, which is indicative of a cooperative unfolding process with no intermediate species. Moreover, the chemically induced unfolding process of both SsEF-1alpha x GDP and nfSsEF-1alpha is fully reversible. Both SsEF-1alpha forms exhibit remarkable stability against urea, but they do not display a strong resistance to the denaturing action of GuHCl. These findings suggest that electrostatic interactions significantly contribute to SsEF-1alpha stability.",

        "abstract": "The urea-induced denaturation of Escherichia coli thioredoxin and thioredoxin variants has been examined by electrophoresis on urea gradient slab gels by the method of Creighton [Creighton, T. (1986) Methods Enzymol. 131, 156-172]. Thioredoxin has only two cysteine residues, and these form a redox-active disulfide at the active site. Oxidized thioredoxin-S2 and reduced thioredoxin-(SH)2 each show two folded isomers with a large difference in stability to urea denaturation. The difference in stability is greater for the isomers of oxidized than for the isomers of reduced thioredoxin. At 2 degrees C, the urea concentrations at the denaturation midpoint are approximately 8 and 4.3 M for the oxidized isomers and 4.8 and 3.7 M for the reduced isomers. The difference between the gel patterns of samples applied in native versus denaturing buffer, and at 2 and 25 degrees C, is characteristic for the involvement of a cis-proline-trans-proline isomerization. The data very strongly suggest that the two folded forms of different stabilities correspond to the cis and trans isomers of the highly conserved Pro 76 peptide bond, which is cis in the crystal structure of oxidized thioredoxin. Urea gel experiments with the mutant thioredoxin P76A, with alanine substituted for proline at position 76, corroborate this interpretation. The electrophoretic banding pattern diagnostic for an involvement of proline isomerization in urea denaturation is not observed for oxidized P76A. In broad estimates of delta G degree for the native-denatured transition, the difference in delta G degree (no urea) between the putative cis and trans isomers of the Ile 75-Pro 76 peptide bond is approximately 3 kcal/mol for oxidized thioredoxin and approximately 1.5 kcal/mol for reduced thioredoxin. Since cis oxidized thioredoxin is much more stable than trans, folded oxidized thioredoxin is essentially all cis. In folded reduced thioredoxin, cis and trans interconvert slowly, on the minute time scale at 2 and 25 degrees C. In the absence of urea, the folded reduced thioredoxin is less than a few percent trans. Three additional mutants with additions or substitutions at the active site also show electrophoresis banding patterns consistent with a difference in stability between cis and trans isomers.",

        "abstract": "A F45W mutant of yeast ubiquitin has been used as a model system to examine the effects of nonnative local interactions on protein folding and stability. Mutating the native TLTGK G-bulged type I turn in the N-terminal beta-hairpin to NPDG stabilizes a nonnative beta-strand alignment in the isolated peptide fragment. However, NMR structural analysis of the native and mutant proteins shows that the NPDG mutant is forced to adopt the native beta-strand alignment and an unfavorable type I NPDG turn. The mutant is significantly less stable (approximately 9 kJ mol(-1)) and folds 30 times slower than the native sequence, demonstrating that local interactions can modulate protein stability and that attainment of a nativelike beta-hairpin conformation in the transition state ensemble is frustrated by the turn mutations. Surprising, alcoholic cosolvents [5-10% (v/v) TFE] are shown to accelerate the folding rate of the NPDG mutant. We conclude, backed-up by NMR data on the peptide fragments, that even though nonnative states in the denatured ensemble are highly populated and their stability further enhanced in the presence of cosolvents, the simultaneous increase in the proportion of nativelike secondary structure (hairpin or helix), in rapid equilibrium with nonnative states, is sufficient to accelerate the folding process. It is evident that modulating local interactions and increasing nonnative secondary structure propensities can change protein stability and folding kinetics. However, nonlocal contacts formed in the global cooperative folding event appear to determine structural specificity.",

        "abstract": "We have carried out a differential scanning calorimetry study into the pH effect on the thermal denaturation of ribonuclease A at several concentrations of the osmolyte sarcosine. In order to properly analyze these data, we have elaborated the thermodynamic theory of the linkage between temperature, cosolvent, and pH effects. The denaturation heat capacity increases with sarcosine concentration. The effects of temperature and sarcosine concentration on the denaturation enthalpy and entropy values are well described by convergence equations, with convergence temperatures of around 100 degrees C for the enthalpy and around 112 degrees C for the entropy; we suggest that these effects might be related to a solvent-induced alteration of the apolar-group-hydration contribution to the folding thermodynamics. From our data, we estimate that about 70 extra molecules of water are thermodynamically bound upon ribonuclease denaturation in diluted aqueous solutions of sarcosine; this number is 6-9 times smaller than that predicted on the basis of the following two premises: (a) the osmolyte is strongly excluded from the surface of both the native and the denatured protein and (b) the denatured state is a fully solvated chain. We suggest that at least one of these two premises does not hold. We briefly comment on the potential use of cosolvent effects on thermal denaturation to evaluate the degree of hydration of denatured proteins (thus providing an independent measure of the consequence of their possible residual structure) and, also, on the possibility of finding substances that are more efficient protein stabilizers than known osmolytes are.",

The thermodynamic parameters for the denaturation of these nine mutant proteins were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the crystal structures were solved at high resolution. The denaturation Gibbs energy (delta delta G) and enthalpy (delta delta H) values of the mutant proteins ranged from +2.2 to- 6.3 kJ/mol and from +7 to -17 kJ/mol, respectively. The structural analyses showed that the mutation site and/or the residues around it in some proteins shifted toward the created cavity, and the substitutions affected not only the mutations site but also other parts far from the site, although the structural changes were not as great. Correlation between the changes in the thermodynamic parameters and the structural features of mutant proteins was examined, including the five Ile to Val mutant human lysozymes [Takano et al.

        "abstract": "The effect of membranes binding on the structure and stability of ferricytochrome c was studied by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Association of cytochrome c with phospholipid membranes containing phosphatidylglycerol as a model acidic phospholipid results in only slight, if any, perturbation of the protein secondary structure. However, upon membrane binding, there is a considerable increase in the accessibility of protein backbone amide groups to hydrogen-deuterium exchange, which suggests a lipid-mediated loosening and/or destabilization of the protein tertiary structure. A lipid-induced conformational perturbation of ferricytochrome c is also indicated by a marked decrease in the thermodynamic stability of the membrane-bound protein. Upon binding to membranes containing dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) or dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) as a single lipid component, the denaturation temperature of ferricytochrome c decreases by approximately 30 degrees C. This is accompanied by a decrease in the calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation, particularly for the DMPG-associated protein. With ferricytochrome c bound to membranes containing a mixture of DMPG (or DOPG) and zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine, the extent of structural perturbation depends on the surface density of the negatively charged lipid head groups, becoming smaller with decreasing proportions of acidic phospholipid in the membrane. The observed destabilization of protein structure mediated by acidic phospholipids (and possibly formation of folding intermediates at the membrane surface) may represent a general property of a larger class of water-soluble proteins for which membrane binding is governed by electrostatic forces.",

        "abstract": "A highly reactive cysteine residue in class pi glutathione S-transferases enhances their susceptibility to chemical alkylation and oxidative stress. Alkylation of the reactive Cys45 in the porcine class pi enzyme (pGSTP1-1) with either N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulpho-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine or iodoacetamide results in a loss of enzyme activity and glutathione-binding function. Similarly, oxidation of pGSTP1-1 with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) also results in a loss of catalytic and glutathione-binding function, but these effects are reversed by the addition of 5 mM glutathione or dithiothreitol. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the H2O2-oxidised enzyme indicates oxidation-induced formation of disulphide bonds involving Cys45. Equilibrium-unfolding studies with guanidinium chloride indicate that the unfolding of Cys45-alkylated and H2O2-oxidised pGSTP1-1 can be described by a two-state model in which the predominant thermodynamically stable species are the folded dimer and unfolded monomer. Unfolding transition curves suggest that the introduction of a large and bulky AEDANS at Cys45 does not affect the unfolding pathway for pGSTP1-1. H2O2-oxidised pGSTP1-1, on the other hand, appears to follow a different unfolding pathway. This appears not to be a result of the introduction of disulphide bonds since the reduction of these bonds in the oxidised protein with dithiothreitol does not affect the unfolding transition. Furthermore, the conformational stability of the oxidised protein is significantly diminished (delta G(H2O) = 11.6 kcal/mol) when compared with unmodified and AEDANS-alkylated enzyme (delta G(H2O) = 22.5 kcal/mol).",

        "abstract": "The urea-induced unfolding of trp aporepressor from Escherichia coli has been studied as a function of pH from 2.5 to 12.0 at 25 degrees C. At pH 7 and above, the unfolding transition, as monitored by changes in the fluorescence intensity at 360 nm, shows a single transition. At low pH, the transition again appears to be a single transition. In the range of 3.5-6.0, the transition is biphasic, indicating the existence of a folding intermediate. The transitions have also been studied using circular dichroism and size exclusion chromatography. The data were fitted by a model in which the dimeric protein first unfolds to form structured monomers, followed by the unfolding of the monomers. From fits with this \"folded monomers\" model, the free energy change for the dimer<-->monomer dissociation becomes less positive as pH is decreased; the free energy change for the unfolding of the monomers is essentially independent of pH. An alternate model is one in which the dimer first undergoes a transition to a partially unfolded dimeric state, with this intermediate then denaturing to unfolded monomers. Both models give adequate fits to the data obtained at a single protein concentration. From a study of the concentration dependence of the urea-induced unfolding at pH 5, the \"folded monomers\" model is found to be more consistent with the data. Size exclusion chromatography data support the description of the intermediate state, which is the most populated state at low pH in the absence of urea, as being a relatively compact monomer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Pyrococcus furiosus is a marine hyperthermophile that grows optimally at 100 degrees C. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) from P. furiosus is a hexamer of identical subunits and has an M(r) = 270,000 +/- 5500 at 25 degrees C. Electron micrographs showed that the subunit arrangement is similar to that of GDH from bovine liver (i.e. 3/2 symmetry in the form of a triangular antiprism). However, GDH from P. furiosus is inactive at temperatures below 40 degrees C and undergoes heat activation above 40 degrees C. Both NAD+ and NADP+ are utilized as cofactors. Apparently the inactive enzyme also binds cofactors, since the enzyme maintains the ability to bind to an affinity column (Cibacron blue F3GA) and is specifically eluted with NADP+. Conformational changes that accompany activation and thermal denaturation were detected by precision differential scanning microcalorimetry. Thermal denaturation starts at 110 degrees C and is completed at 118 degrees C. delta(cal) = 414 Kcal [mol GDH]-1. Tm = 113 degrees C. This increase in heat capacity indicates an extensive irreversible unfolding of the secondary structure as evidenced also by a sharp increase in absorbance at 280 nm and inactivation of the enzyme. The process of heat activation of GDH from 40 to 80 degrees C is accompanied by a much smaller increase in absorbance at 280 nm and a reversible increase in heat capacity with delta(cal) = 187 Kcal [mol GDH]-1 and Tm = 57 degrees C. This absorbance change as well as the moderate increase in heat capacity suggest that thermal activation leads to some exposure of hydrophobic groups to solvent water as the GDH structure is opened slightly. The increase in absorbance at 280 nm during activation is only 12% of that for denaturation. Overall, GDH appears to be well adapted to correspond with the growth response of P. furiosus to temperature.",

        "abstract": "Temperature-induced reversible unfolding and refolding of the three-stranded alpha-helical coiled coil, Lpp-56, were studied by kinetic and thermodynamic methods, using CD spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and scanning calorimetry. It was found that both unfolding and refolding reactions of this protein in neutral solution in the presence of 100 mM NaCl are characterized by unusually slow kinetics, which permits detailed investigation of the mechanism of these reactions. Kinetic analyses show that the unfolding of this coiled coil represents a single-stage first-order reaction, while the refolding represents a single-stage third-order reaction. The activation enthalpy and entropy for unfolding do not depend noticeably on temperature and are both significantly greater than those for the folding reaction, which show a significant dependence on temperature. The activation heat capacity change for the unfolding reaction is close to zero, while it is quite significant for the folding reaction. The correlation between the activation and structural parameters obtained for the Lpp-56 coiled coil suggests that interhelical van der Waals interactions are disrupted in the transition state, which is nevertheless still compact, and water has not yet penetrated into the interface; the transition from the transient state to the unfolded state results in hydration of exposed apolar groups of the interface and the disruption of helices. The low propensity for the Lpp-56 strands to fold and associate is caused by the high number of charged groups at neutral pH. On one hand, these charges give rise to considerable repulsive forces destabilizing the helical conformation of the strands. On the other hand, they align the folded helices in parallel and in register so that the apolar sides face each other, and the oppositely charged groups may form salt links, which are important for the formation of the trimeric coiled coil. A decrease in pH, which eliminates the salt links, dramatically decreases the stability of Lpp-56; its structure becomes less rigid and unfolds much faster.",

N-terminal acetylation has been confirmed by mass spectral analysis of intact and proteolytically digested protein. The histidine-heme loop-forming equilibrium, under denaturing conditions (3 M guanidine hydrochloride), has been measured by pH titration providing an observed pK(a), pK(a)(obs), for each variant. N-terminal acetylation prevents the N-terminal amino group-heme binding equilibrium from interfering with measurements of histidine-heme affinity. Significant deviation is observed from the linear dependence of pK(a)(obs) on the log of the number of monomers in the loop formed, expected for a random coil denatured state. The maximum histidine-heme affinity occurs for a loop size of 37 monomers. For loop sizes of 37-83 monomers, histidine-heme pK(a)(obs) values are consistent with a scaling factor of -4.2+/-0.3. This value is much larger than the scaling factor of -1.5 for a freely jointed random coil, which is commonly used to represent the conformational properties of protein denatured states. For loop sizes of nine to 22 monomers, chain stiffness is likely responsible for the decreases in histidine-heme affinity relative to a loop size of 37. The results are discussed in terms of residual structure and sequence composition effects on the conformational properties of the denatured states of proteins.",

By contrast, under these conditions there is no evidence for a populated intermediate in the folding of its more stable homologue, Im9, even in the presence of 0.4 M sodium sulphate. Previous studies using phi-value analysis have shown that the Im7 intermediate is misfolded, in that three of its four native helices are formed, but are docked in a non-native manner. Using knowledge of the structure of the intermediate of Im7, we have used rational design to stabilise an intermediate formed during the folding of Im9 by the introduction of specific stabilising interactions at positions known to stabilise the Im7 folding intermediate through non-native interactions. We show that the redesigned Im9 sequence folds with three-state kinetics at pH 7.0 and have used phi-value analysis to demonstrate that this species resembles the misfolded intermediate populated during Im7 folding. The redesigned Im9 sequence folds 20-fold faster than the wild-type protein under conditions in which folding is two-state. The data show that intermediate formation is an important feature of folding, even for small proteins such as Im9 for which these partially folded states do not become significantly populated. In addition, they show that the introduction of stabilising interactions can lead to rapid refolding, even when the contacts introduced are non-native.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium stabilities to guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced denaturation and kinetic folding mechanisms have been characterized for three archael histones: hFoB from the mesophile Methanobacterium formicicum; hMfB from the thermophile Methanothermus fervidus; and hPyA1 from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus strain GB-3a. These histones are homodimers of 67 to 69 residues per monomer. The equilibrium unfolding transitions, as measured by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) are highly reversible, two-state processes. The mesophilic hFoB is very unstable and requires approximately 1 M trimethyl-amine-N-oxide (TMAO) to completely populate the native state. The thermophilic histones are more stable, with deltaG degrees (H2O) values of 14 and 16 kcal mol(-1) for hMfB and hPyA1, respectively. The kinetic folding of hFoB and hPyA1 are two-state processes, with no detectable transient kinetic intermediates. For hMfB, there is significant development of CD signal in the stopped-flow dead time, indicative of the formation of a monomeric intermediate, which then folds/associates in a single, second-order step to form the native dimer. While the equilibrium stability to chemical denaturation correlates very well with host growth temperature, there is no simple relationship between folding rates and stability for the archael histones. In the absence of denaturant, the log of the unfolding rates correlate with equilibrium stability. The folding/association of the moderately stable hMfB is the most rapid, with a rate constant in the absence of GdmCl of 3 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), compared to 9 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) for the more stable hPyA1. It appears that the formation of the hMfB burst-phase monomeric ensemble serves to enhance folding efficiency, rather than act as a kinetic trap. The folding mechanism of the archael histones is compared to the folding of other intertwined, segment-swapped, alpha-helical, DNA-binding dimers (ISSADD), including the eukaryotic heterodimeric histones, which fold more rapidly. The importance of monomeric and dimeric kinetic intermediates in accelerating ISSADD folding reactions is discussed.",

The products of denaturation were further characterized by intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) measurements. It has been observed that the reversible unfolding of cyt c by CaCl2 occurs in two distinct stages or involves three species (or states) namely N<-->X<-->D. Characterization of the native state, N intermediate state, X and the end product, D suggests that (i) During N<-->X only heme is exposed and no secondary structure unfolding occurs so that X state remains as compact as the native state. (ii) Stage X<-->D shows the melting of secondary structure. (iii) The end product corresponds to a random coil. and (iv) Thermodynamic characterization of the end product shows that heme plays an important role in the stability of the protein and removal of heme will lead to the unfolding of cyt c.

One specific example is alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT), which undergoes misfolding and aggregation that has been implicated in emphysema and Alzheimer's disease. In this study we have used guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced denaturation to investigate the conformational changes involved in the folding and unfolding of ACT. When the reaction was followed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, one stable intermediate was observed in 1.5 m GdnHCl. The same experiment monitored by fluorescence revealed a second intermediate formed in 2.5 m GdnHCl. Both these intermediates bound the hydrophobic dye ANS. These data suggest a four-state model for ACT folding N <--> I(1) <--> I(2) <--> U. I(1) and I(2) both have a similar loss of secondary structure (20%) compared with the native state. In I(2), however, there is a significant loss of tertiary interactions as revealed by changes in fluorescence emission maximum and intensity. Kinetic analysis of the unfolding reaction indicated that the native state is unstable with a fast rate of unfolding in water of 0.4 s(-1).

        "abstract": "We have previously attempted to simulate domain creation in early protein evolution by recombining polypeptide segments from non-homologous proteins, and we have described the structure of one such de novo protein, 1b11, a segment-swapped tetramer with novel architecture. Here, we have analyzed the thermodynamic stability and folding kinetics of the 1b11 tetramer and its monomeric and dimeric intermediates, and of 1b11 mutants with changes at the domain interface. Denatured 1b11 polypeptides fold into transient, folded monomers with marginal stability (DeltaG<1kcalmol(-1)) which convert rapidly ( approximately 6x10(4)M(-1)s(-1)) into dimers (DeltaG=9.8kcal/mol) and then more slowly ( approximately 3M(-1)s(-1)) into tetramers (DeltaG=28kcalmol(-1)). Segment swapping takes place during dimerization, as suggested by mass spectroscopic analysis of covalently linked peptides derived from proteolysis of a disulfide-linked dimer. Our results confirm that segment swapping and associated oligomerization are both powerful ways of stabilizing proteins, and we suggest that this may have been a feature of early protein evolution.",

        "abstract": "Coulombic interactions between charges on the surface of proteins contribute to stability. It is difficult, however, to estimate their importance by protein engineering methods because mutation of one residue in an ion pair alters the energetics of many interactions in addition to the coulombic energy between the two components. We have estimated the interaction energy between two charged residues, Asp-12 and Arg-16, in an alpha-helix on the surface of a barnase mutant by invoking a double-mutant cycle involving wild-type enzyme (Asp-12, Thr-16), the single mutants Thr----Arg-16 and Asp----Ala-12, and the double mutant Asp----Ala-12, Thr----Arg-16. The changes in free energy of unfolding of the single mutants are not additive because of the coulombic interaction energy. Additivity is restored at high concentrations of salt that shield electrostatic interactions. The geometry of the ion pair in the mutant was assumed to be the same as that in the highly homologous ribonuclease from Bacillus intermedius, binase, which has Asp-12 and Arg-16 in the native enzyme. The ion pair does not form a hydrogen-bonded salt bridge, but the charges are separated by 5-6 A. The mutant barnase containing the ion pair Asp-12/Arg-16 is more stable than wild type by 0.5 kcal/mol, but only a part of the increased stability is attributable to the electrostatic interaction. We present a formal analysis of how double-mutant cycles can be used to measure the energetics of pairwise interactions.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium unfolding and the kinetic folding and unfolding of goat alpha-lactalbumin (GLA) were studied by near- and far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) and by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. Specifically, the influence of environmental conditions such as pH and Ca2+ binding was examined. Compared to the apo-form, the Ca2+-bound form was found to be strongly stabilized in equilibrium conditions at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C. The kinetics of the refolding of apo-GLA show a major change of fluorescence intensity during the experimental dead-time, but this unresolved effect is strongly diminished in holo-GLA. In both cases, however, the chevron plots can adequately be fitted to a three-state model. Moreover, double-mix stopped-flow experiments showed that the native state (N) is reached through one major pathway without the occurrence of alternative tracks. In contrast to the homologous bovine alpha-lactalbumin (BLA), the compactness of GLA is strongly influenced by the presence of Ca2+ ions. Unlike the two-state transition observed in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced equilibrium denaturation experiments at higher pH, an equilibrium intermediate state (I) is involved in denaturation at pH 4.5. In the latter case, analysis of the kinetic data makes clear that the intermediate and the unfolded states (U) show practically no Gibbs free energy difference and that they are in rapid equilibrium with each other. A possible explanation for these variations in stability and in folding characteristics with pH could be the degree of protonation of His107 that directly influences non-native interactions. Variation of environmental conditions and even small differences in sequence, therefore, can result in important effects on thermodynamic and folding parameters.",

The existence of the equilibrium intermediate at around 1 M is corroborated by its enhanced binding of fluorophobic probe 1,8-ANS. The intermediate was found to have a compact shape as measured by its Stokes radius by size-exclusion chromatography. Furthermore, near-UV CD analysis of this enzymatically inactive intermediate showed a significantly disrupted tertiary structure with only a minor change in the secondary structure, which is a characteristic of typical molten globule states.

Protein stability is a key issue for chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. The development of robust proteins/enzymes with the ability to withstand the potentially harsh conditions of industrial operations is of high importance. A number of strategies are currently being employed to achieve this goal. Two particular approaches, (i) directed evolution and (ii) computational protein design, are quite powerful yet have only recently been combined or applied and analyzed in parallel. In directed evolution, libraries of variants are searched experimentally for clones possessing the desired properties. With computational methods, protein design algorithms are utilized to perform in silico screening for stable protein sequences. Here, we used gene libraries of an unstable variant of streptococcal protein G (Gbeta1) and an in vivo screening method to identify stabilized variants. Many variants with notably increased thermal stabilities were isolated and characterized. Concomitantly, computational techniques and protein design algorithms were used to perform in silico screening of the same destabilized variant of Gbeta1. The combined use, and critical analysis, of these methods promises to advance the field of protein design.",

Structural studies have confirmed that this domain belongs to the death domain superfamily which includes PAAD/CARD/DED/DD families. Recently, the 3D structures determined by NMR of NALP1 and ASC PAAD domain, members of the PAAD family, have shown that it is composed of a 6 helix bundle as with other death domain family members. However, helix-3 in the solved structures is unordered in solution. In this study we compare the thermodynamic, folding and stability properties of different members of the PAAD and CARD families and investigate structural conformational changes induced by the helix inducers trifluoroethanol and SDS on the PAAD domain of IFI16 and on the CARD domain of RAIDD. We show that inside the PAAD and CARD families, members have similar thermodynamic properties, however, the DeltaG of folding for PAAD and CARD members are, respectively, -1.4 and -5.5 kcal mol(-1). This difference is attributed to less alpha helical content for PAAD due to the unfolding of helix-3 that lowers bonded energy and increases disorder when compared to CARD members. Despite identical fold between PAAD and CARD families but limited sequence identity, there are striking differences in the thermodynamics of both families.",

This enzyme shows no sequence or structural homology to the chromosomal DHFRs. The active form of the protein is a homotetramer possessing D(2) symmetry and a single active-site pore. Two tryptophans occur per monomer: W38 and its symmetry-related residues (W138, W238, and W338) occur at the dimer-dimer interfaces, while W45 and its symmetry-related partners (W145, W245, and W345) occur at the monomer-monomer interfaces. Two single-tryptophan mutant genes were constructed to determine the structural and functional consequences of four mutations per tetramer. The W45F mutant retains full enzyme activity and the fluorescence environment of the unmutated W38 residues clearly monitors ligand binding and a pH dependent tetramer right harpoon over left harpoon 2 dimers equilibrium. In contrast, four simultaneous W38F mutations at the dimer-dimer interfaces result in tetramer destabilization. The ensuing dimer is relatively inactive, as is dimeric wild-type R67 DHFR. A comparison of emission spectra indicates the fluorescent signal of wild-type R67 DHFR is dominated by the contribution from W38. Equilibrium unfolding/folding curves at pH 5.0, where all protein variants are dimeric, indicate the environment monitored by the W38 residue is slightly less stable than the environment monitored by the W45 residue.",

        "abstract": "A previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of cytochrome b5 (cyt b5) at 25 degrees C displayed localized dynamics on the surface of the protein giving rise to the periodic formation of a cleft that provides access to the heme through a protected hydrophobic channel [Storch and Daggett (1995) Biochemistry 34, 9682]. Here we describe the production and testing of mutants designed to prevent the cleft from opening using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques. Two mutants have been designed to close the surface cleft: S18D to introduce a salt bridge and S18C:R47C to incorporate a disulfide bond. The putative cleft forms between two separate cores of the protein: one is structural in nature and can be monitored through the fluorescence of Trp 22, and the other binds the heme prosthetic group and can be tracked via heme absorbance. An increase in motion localized to the cleft region was observed for each protein, except for the disulfide-containing variant, in MD simulations at 50 degrees C compared to simulations at 25 degrees C. For the disulfide-containing variant, the cleft remained closed. Both urea and temperature denaturation curves were nearly identical for wild-type and mutant proteins when heme absorbance was monitored. In contrast, fluorescence studies revealed oxidized S18C:R47C to be considerably more stable based on the midpoints of the denaturation transitions, Tm and U1/2. Moreover, the fluorescence changes for each protein were complete at approximately 50 degrees C and a urea concentration of approximately 3.9 M, significantly below the temperature and urea concentration (62 degrees C, 5 M urea) required to observe heme release. In addition, solvent accessibility based on acrylamide quenching of Trp 22 was lower in the S18C:R47C mutant, particularly at 50 degrees C, before heme release [presented in the accompanying paper (58)]. The results suggest that a constraining disulfide bond can be designed to inhibit dynamic cleft formation on the surface of cyt b5. Located near the heme, the native dynamics of the cleft may be functionally important for protein-protein recognition and/or complex stabilization.",

Unfolding of the enzyme was monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The steepness of the fluorescence and CD changes between 2 and 8 M urea, and the lack of any discernible plateau suggests that unfolding of the protein is a cooperative process. The unfolding of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase as a function of urea concentration was monitored by fluorescence measurements of the tryptophanyl residues. The kinetic results indicate that the aminotransferase unfolds in a single kinetic phase. Unfolded 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase recovers immediately its catalytic activity upon dilution with buffers of neutral pH. Based on equilibrium and kinetic results, a two-state model for the unfolding of the aminotransferase is proposed.",

Class I mutants significantly decrease the stability and cooperativity of folding of the intermediate. Class II and III mutants show smaller effects on stability and have little effect on cooperativity. Qualitatively similar results to those found in I were obtained for all three classes of mutants in native myoglobin (N), demonstrating that hydrophobic burial is fairly specific to native helix packing sites in I as well as in N. These results suggest that hydrophobic burial along native-like interhelical contacts is important for the formation of the cooperatively folded intermediate.",

Pressure-induced unfolding, monitored by the shift of the center of mass of the fluorescence spectrum, showed that DeltaV(0) is in the range of 60-70 mL/mol, not significantly different between cavity mutants and compact azurin species such as the wild-type and the mutant C3A/C26A, in which the superficial disulphide has been removed. The lack of extra volume in F110S and I7S proves that the engineered cavities, 40 A(3) in I7S and 100 A(3) in F110S, are filled with water molecules. Changes in flexibility of the protein matrix around the chromophore were monitored by the intrinsic phosphorescence lifetime (tau(0)). The application of pressure in the predenaturation range initially decreases the internal flexibility of azurin, the trend eventually reverting on approaching unfolding. The main difference between compact folds, wild-type and C3A/C26A, and cavity mutants is that the inversion point is powered from approximately 3 kbar to 1.5 kbar for F110S and <0.1 kbar for I7S, meaning that in the latter species pressure-induced internal hydration dominates very early over any compaction of the globular fold resulting from the reduction of internal free volume. The similar response between wild-type and the significantly less-stable C3A/C26A mutant suggests that thermodynamic stability per se is not the dominant factor regulating pressure-induced internal hydration of proteins.",

Two of the mutants, containing a total of 14 different substitutions, also footprint operator DNA in vitro. The stability of some of the proteins with multiple-alanine mutations is significantly greater than that predicted from the sum of the single substitutions, suggesting that a subset of the wild-type residues in Arc may interact in an unfavorable fashion.

The three proteins have similar conformational features as shown by the similar characteristics of their CD spectra in the far- and near-ultraviolet region. A metal-ion-binding site was identified in the hybrid glucanase (1-16)AMY x MAC(17-214) by a crystal structure analysis [Keitel, T., Simon, O., Borriss, R. & Heinemann, U. (1993) Proc. Natl Acad.

Surprisingly, for (1-12)AMY x MAC(13-214), which differs from (1-12)AMY x des-Tyr13MAC(14-214) by only one additional amino acid in an N-terminal loop region, the effect of Ca2+ ions on the stability is small. The exchange of a few amino acid residues near the N-terminus of the B. macerans glucanase against amino acids found at comparable positions in the B. amyloliquefaciens glucanase seems to influence very strongly the strength of the Ca2+ binding site and concomitantly the stability of the hybrid glucanases.",

These mutations were designed to probe denatured-state effects on the unfolding equilibrium of this protein. The hydrophilic amino acid Lys was replaced with the hydrophobic amino acids Met, Tyr, Phe, and Trp. The idea was to induce stabilizing hydrophobic interactions in the unfolded state, while having little effect on the folded-state energy due to the high solvent exposure of this site. Fourier transform infrared spectral analyses indicate that none of these mutations significantly affect the native fold of the protein. The stability of each protein to guanidine hydrochloride denaturation was monitored at 25 degrees C by circular dichroism spectroscopy. All four hydrophobic mutants decreased the value of delta Go uH2O, the free energy of unfolding of the protein in the absence of denaturant, by 1.0-1.5 kcal/mol. The delta Go uH2O values for these proteins correlate linearly (correlation coefficient of 0.98) with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid at position 73 of the sequence. These data are consistent with the idea that the position-73 mutants are more buried in the denatured state than in the native state, suggestive of a compact denatured state where such interactions would be possible.",

At pH 7.50, purified human phenylalanine hydroxylase is transiently activated in the presence of 0-4 M urea but slowly inactivated at higher denaturant concentrations. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the enzyme is denatured through at least two distinct transitions. The presence of phenylalanine (L-Phe) shifts the transition midpoint of the first transition from 1.4 to 2.7 M urea, whereas the second transition is unaffected by this substrate. Apparently the free energy of denaturation was almost identical for the free enzyme and for the enzyme-substrate complex, but significant differences in dDeltaG(D)/d[urea] (m(D) values) were observed for the first denaturation transition. In the absence of substrate, a high rate of non-covalent aggregation was observed for the enzyme in the presence of 1-4 M urea. All three tryptophan residues in the enzyme (Trp-120, Trp-187, and Trp-326) were mutated to phenylalanine, either as single mutations or in combination, in order to identify the residues involved in the spectroscopic transitions. A gradual dissociation of the native tetrameric enzyme to increasingly denatured dimeric and monomeric forms was demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography in the presence of denaturants.",

        "abstract": "The intermolecular interactions of the major cold-shock protein from Bacillus subtilis (CspB) in solution in the presence of different salts, including phosphate, have been studied by means of scanning calorimetry and size-exclusion chromatography. Calorimetric results indicate that, in all cases, protein unfolding can be approximated by a 2-state model, but the modes of unfolding can differ depending on the conditions. In the presence of phosphate, the cooperative folding unit is a monomer, whereas in the absence of phosphate, the cooperative unit is a dimer. The difference in the self-association of CspB in the presence and absence of phosphate was supported by size-exclusion chromatography. These results are compared with recent structural studies of CspB in crystal and in solution.",

        "abstract": "The study of proteins from extremophilic organisms continues to generate interest in the field of protein folding because paradigms explaining the enhanced stability of these proteins still elude us and such studies have the potential to further our knowledge of the forces stabilizing proteins. We have undertaken such a study with our model protein HPr from a mesophile, Bacillus subtilis, and a thermophile, Bacillus stearothermophilus. We report here the high-resolution structures of the wild-type HPr protein from the thermophile and a variant, F29W. The variant proved to crystallize in two forms: a monomeric form with a structure very similar to the wild-type protein as well as a domain-swapped dimer. Interestingly, the structure of the domain-swapped dimer for HPr is very different from that observed for a homologous protein, Crh, from B.subtilis. The existence of a domain-swapped dimer has implications for amyloid formation and is consistent with recent results showing that the HPr proteins can form amyloid fibrils. We also characterized the conformational stability of the thermophilic HPr proteins using thermal and solvent denaturation methods and have used the high-resolution structures in an attempt to explain the differences in stability between the different HPr proteins. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the solution properties of the HPr proteins using a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods.",

        "abstract": "The energetics of complementary packing of nonpolar side chains in the hydrophobic core of a protein were analyzed by protein engineering experiments. We have made the mutations Ile----Val, Ile----Ala, and Leu----Ala in a region of the small bacterial ribonuclease barnase where the major alpha-helix packs onto the central beta-sheet. The destabilization resulting from the creation of cavities was determined by measuring the decrease in free energy of folding from reversible denaturation induced by urea, guanidinium chloride, or heat. The different methods give consistent and reproducible results. The loss in free energy of folding for the mutant proteins is 1.0-1.6 kcal/mol per methylene group removed. This exceeds by severalfold the values obtained from model experiments of the partitioning of relevant side chains between aqueous and nonpolar solvents. Much of this discrepancy arises because two surfaces are buried when a protein folds--both the amino acid side chain in question and the portions of the protein into which it packs. These experiments directly demonstrate that the interior packing of a protein is crucial in stabilizing its three-dimensional structure: the conversion of leucine or isoleucine to alanine in the hydrophobic core loses half the net free energy of folding of barnase with a concomitant decrease in yield of the expressed recombinant protein.",

The results from these three techniques were similar, although the stability as measured by fluorescence was slightly lower than that measured by FTIR and SAXS. The resulting phase diagram exhibits the well-known curvature for heat and cold denaturation of proteins, due to the large decrease in heat capacity upon folding. The volume change for unfolding became less negative with increasing temperatures, consistent with a larger thermal expansivity for the unfolded state than for the folded state. Fluorescence-detected pressure-jump kinetics measurements revealed that the curvature in the phase diagram is due primarily to the rate constant for folding, indicating a loss in heat capacity for the transition state relative to the unfolded state. The similar temperature dependence of the equilibrium and activation volume changes for folding indicates that the thermal expansivities of the folded and transition states are similar. This, along with the fact that the activation volume for folding is positive over the temperature range examined, the nonlinear dependence of the folding rate constant upon temperature implicates significant dehydration in the rate-limiting step for folding of Snase.",

        "abstract": "Sequence/structure relationships have been explored by site-directed mutagenesis using a structurally known adenylate kinase. In particular the effects of helix capping and nonpolar core expansion on thermodynamic stability have been analyzed. Six point mutations were produced and characterized by SDS/PAGE, native PAGE, isoelectric focussing, electrophoretic titration, enzyme kinetics, and X-ray structure analysis. Heat-denaturation experiments yielded melting temperatures Tm and melting enthalpy changes delta Hm. The heat capacity change delta Cp of the wild-type enzyme was determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation in conjunction with Tm and delta Hm. Using the wild-type delta Cp value, Gibbs free energy changes delta G at room temperature were calculated for all mutants. Four mutants were designed for helix capping stabilization, but only one of them showed such an effect. Because of electrostatic interference with the induced-fit motion, one mutant decreased the catalytic activity strongly. Two mutants expanded nonpolar cores causing destabilization. The mutant with the lower stability could be crystallized and subjected to an X-ray analysis at 223-pm resolution which showed the structural changes. The enzyme was stabilized by adding a -Pro-His-His tail to the C-terminal alpha-helix for nickel-chelate chromatography. This addition constitutes a helix cap. Taken together, the results demonstrate that stabilization by helix capping is difficult to achieve because the small positive effect is drowned by adverse mutational disruption. Further addition of atoms to nonpolar cores destabilized the protein, although the involved geometry changes were very small, demonstrating the importance of efficient packing.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the possible relationship between biological activity and structural stability in selected regions of the insulin molecule, we have analyzed the guanidine hydrochloride induced reversible unfolding of a series of mutant insulins using a combination of near- and far-UV circular dichroism (CD). The unfolding curves are reasonably described on the basis of a two-state denaturation scheme; however, the observation of subtle differences between near- and far-UV CD detected unfolding indicates that intermediates may be present. Three regions of the insulin molecule are analyzed in detail with respect to their contribution to folding stability, i.e., the central B-chain helix, the NH2-terminal A-chain helix, and the B25-B30 extended chain region. Considerable enhancement of folding stability is engineered by mutations at the N-cap of the central B-chain helix and at the C-cap of the NH2-terminal A-chain helix. Mutations that confer increased stability in these regions are identical to those that lead to enhanced biological activity. In contrast, for insulin species modified in the B25-B30 region of the molecule, we observe no correlation between global folding stability and bioactivity. Mutations in the three regions examined are found to affect stability in a nearly independent fashion, and stabilizing mutations are generally found to enhance the cooperativity of the unfolding transition. We conclude that highly potent insulins (i.e., HisA8, ArgA8, GluB10, and AspB10) elicit enhanced activity because these mutations stabilize structural motifs of critical importance for receptor recognition.",

        "abstract": "We have used differential scanning calorimetry to study the effects of phalloidin on F and G actin stability. For F actin, saturating concentrations of phalloidin induced an important shift on the transition temperature, Tm, from 69.5 degrees C to 83.5 degrees C. However, the calorimetric enthalpy remained unchanged. Using lower phalloidin concentrations, monomers linked to phalloidin, as well as neighboring unlinked monomers, were both stabilized. Contrary to previous reports, phalloidin was also shown to affect G actin, shifting its Tm from 59.5 degrees C to 75 degrees C. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain this finding: first, it could indicate a real interaction of phalloidin with G actin, and second, heating of the specimen during the scan could have induced polymerization of some G actin to the F form. The resulting F polymer would then interact with phalloidin, thus shifting the equilibrium between G and F actin towards the polymeric form.",

        "abstract": "Barnase, a small extracellular ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and its intracellular inhibitor barstar have co-evolved to bind tightly and rapidly. Barnase has also evolved to be catalytically active. The active site of barnase and its binding site for barstar use the same subset of amino acids. The exception is Glu73 (the general base in catalysis), which although located at the centre of the binding site, is separated by three ordered water molecules from barstar. We examined in this work the contribution of Glu73 to both catalysis and barstar binding. Truncation mutants of the general base (Glu73 --> Ala or Ser) retain a residual RNase activity of about 0.3% while mutants with larger hydrophobic replacements (Glu 73 --> Trp or Phe) have virtually no catalytic activity. This, and binding data of 3'-GMP with the different barnase mutants suggest that the loss in activity results from the elimination of the general base, which can be substituted to some extent by water or other polar side-chains in truncation mutants. All of the Glu73 mutations lead to a weakening of the free energy of complex formation with barstar by 1.4 to 3.0 kcal/mol (including Gln). This is surprising, since Glu73 does not interact directly with barstar and there is an electrostatic repulsion between Glu73 on barnase and the negatively charged binding surface of barstar. A newly developed method of constructing double mutant cycles between multiple mutations at the same site appears to pinpoint a favourable interaction between Glu73 and one of its nearest neighbours in barstar, Asp39. The coupling energy between those residues is presumably indirect: the carboxylate of Glu73 organizes neighbouring positively charged groups in barnase, Lys27, Arg83, and Arg87 to interact with Asp39 in barstar. This emphasizes that an apparent interaction between a pair of residues as measured with double mutant cycles is the sum of their direct and indirect interactions.",

        "abstract": "In order to clarify the role played by the N-terminal region for the conformational stability of the thermophilic esterase 2 (EST2) from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, two mutant forms have been investigated: a variant obtained by deleting the first 35 residues at the N-terminus (EST2-36del), and a variant obtained by mutating Lys102 to Gln (K102Q) to perturb the N-terminus by destroying the salt bridge E43-K102. The temperature- and denaturant-induced unfolding of EST2 and the two mutant forms have been studied by means of circular dichroism (CD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fluorescence measurements. In line with its thermophilic origin, the denaturation temperature of EST2 is high: T(d)=91 degrees C and 86 degrees C if detected by recording the CD signal at 222 nm and 290 nm, respectively. This difference suggests that the thermal denaturation process, even though reversible, is more complex than a two-state Nright arrow over left arrowD transition. The non-two-state behaviour is more pronounced in the case of the two mutant forms. The complex DSC profiles of EST2 and both mutant forms have been analysed by means of a deconvolution procedure. The thermodynamic parameters characterizing the two transitions obtained in the case of EST2 are: T(d,1)=81 degrees C, Delta(d)H(1)=440 kJ mol(-1), Delta(d)C(p,1)=7 kJ K(-1)mol(-1), T(d,2)=86 degrees C, Delta(d)H(2)=710 kJ mol(-1), and Delta(d)C(p,2)=9 kJ K(-1)mol(-1). The first transition occurs at lower temperatures in the two mutant forms, whereas the second transition is always centred at 86 degrees C. The results indicate that EST2 possesses two structural domains whose coupling is tight in the wild-type protein, but markedly weakens in the two mutant forms as a consequence of the perturbations in the N-terminal region.",

        "abstract": "Enzyme stability can be an important parameter in the design of recombinant toxins because unstable proteins are often degraded before they can reach their cellular target. There is great interest in the design of human pancreatic ribonuclease variants that could be cytotoxic against tumoral cells. To this end, some residues in the protein need to be substituted, but this may result in a loss of stability. Previous papers have reported the production of N- and C-terminal human pancreatic ribonuclease variants with increased thermal stability. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different amino acid changes at the N-terminus of the protein to its thermostability increase. We show that this increase correlates with the helical propensity of the first alpha-helix of the protein. On the other hand, deletion of the four last residues of the protein does not affect its thermal stability. These results set the basis for the design of a human pancreatic ribonuclease template on which amino acid substitutions can be made that could render the enzyme cytotoxic, without an important loss in its stability.",

Two mutants, BstHU-A27S and BstHU-V42I, in which Ala27 and Val42 in BstHU were replaced by the corresponding amino acids Ser27 and Ile42, respectively, in the homologue from a mesophile B. subtilis (BsuHU), were less stable than the wild-type BstHU (63.9 degreesC), showing Tm values of 58.4 degreesC and 60.1 degreesC, respectively, as estimated by circular dichroism (CD) analysis at pH 7.0. The denaturation of two mutants was further characterized using differential scanning calorimetry; the Tm values obtained by calorimetric analysis were in good agreement with those estimated by CD analysis. The results suggest that Ala27 and Val42 are partly responsible for enhancing the thermostability of BstHU. When considered together with previous results, it is revealed that Gly15, Ala27, Glu34, Lys38, and Val42 are essential for the thermostability of thermophilic protein BstHU. Moreover, five thermostabilizing mutations were simultaneously introduced into BsuHU, which resulted in a quintuple mutant with a Tm value of 71.3 degreesC, which is higher than that of BstHU, and also resulted in insusceptibility to proteinase digestion.",

Distinctly different, more complex DSC curves were obtained for the thermal denaturation of the cAMP-protein and cGMP-protein complexes. The DSC data indicate intermolecular cooperation among CAP dimers, with the extent of oligomerization remaining unchanged during unfolding of the protein. The DSC curves for the thermal denaturation of the cAMP-protein complex and cGMP-protein complex have been resolved into three and two components, respectively, according to the model of independent two-state processes. Analysis of the DSC data suggests two and three independent domains for cGMP-protein and cAMP-protein complexes, respectively, with dissociation of mononucleotide occurring in the second component in both cases during protein denaturation. Furthermore, our studies indicate that the presence of either ligand alters the degree of oligomerization of CAP dimers, cAMP having a greater effect than cGMP.",

        "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been employed to characterize the thermal denaturation of CPL1 lysozyme and its isolated fragments in the absence and presence of choline. The heat capacity function of CPL1 lysozyme shows two peaks with Tm values of 43.5 and 51.4 degrees C. At saturating concentrations of choline the second transition disappears, and the Tm is shifted to higher temperatures. The DSC thermogram of the C-CPL1 protein corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain of CPL1 lysozyme has a single peak with a Tm of 42.9 degrees C. The effect of choline is very similar to that observed for the whole CPL1 lysozyme. The NH2-terminal fragment obtained by proteolytic digestion shows a Tm of 52 degrees C, close to that of 51.4 degrees C found for the second transition of CPL1, and choline does not affect the Tm nor the denaturation enthalpy. These data suggest that choline is bound to the COOH-terminal domain of the protein. Deconvolution of the excess heat capacity curve of the CPL1 lysozyme shows that the data can be fitted to two two-state independent transitions. The analysis of the DSC curves showed that the NH2-terminal unfolding enthalpy steadily decreases with increasing concentrations of choline. These results indicate that, under saturating concentrations of choline, whole CPL1 could unfold as a single cooperative unit.",

For this purpose expansion coefficients of both the native and unfolded state of a variety of proteins have been determined and used together with compressibility coefficients to calculate the difference between isobaric and isochoric heat capacity, (cp - cv), for the unfolding transition. This difference delta (cp - cv) = (c - c) - (c - c) turns out to be a positive number that is larger than the experimental isobaric heat capacity change (formula:see text) [corrected] for the proteins studied. The generally observed positive heat capacity change on unfolding can therefore alternatively be interpreted as resulting from the difference in work involved in changing the intra- and intermolecular interactions including the weak, highly distance-dependent, van der Waals interactions, for the unfolded and native state, respectively. The difference in expansion work against the atmospheric pressure is negligible. This macroscopic interpretation cannot rule out that part of the denaturational heat capacity increase is also due to the different interaction with water of the native and unfolded conformations of the protein.",

H. J., et al. (1999) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1431, 37-44]. For a detailed understanding of the higher thermostability of these V(HH) fragments, knowledge of their structure and conformational dynamics is required. As a first step toward this goal, we report here the essentially complete (1)H and (15)N NMR backbone resonance assignments of a llama V(HH) antibody fragment, and an extensive analysis of the structure at higher temperatures. The H-D exchange NMR data at 300 K indicate that the framework of the llama V(HH) fragment is highly protected with a DeltaG(ex) of >5.4 kcal/mol, while more flexibility is observed for surface residues, particularly in the loops and the two outer strands (residues 4-7, 10-13, and 58-60) of the beta-sheet. The CD data indicate a reversible, two-state unfolding mechanism with a melting transition at 333 K and a DeltaH(m) of 56 kcal/mol. H-D exchange studies using NMR and ESI-MS show that below 313 K exchange occurs through local unfolding events whereas above 333 K exchange mainly occurs through global unfolding. The lack of a stable core at high temperatures, observed for V(HH) fragments, has also been observed for conventional antibody fragments. The main distinction between the llama V(HH) fragment and conventional antibody fragments is the reversibility of the thermal unfolding process, explaining its retained functionality after exposure to high temperatures.",

For the oxidized form of Gly-76 iso-2, an estimate of stability by guanidine hydrochloride induced unfolding indicates that the mutation destabilizes the protein by 1.2 kcal/mol under standard conditions of neutral pH and 20 degrees C (delta G degrees u = 3.8 kcal/mol for normal Pro-76 iso-2 versus 2.6 kcal/mol for Gly-76 iso-2). The kinetics of folding/unfolding have been monitored by fluorescence changes throughout the transition region using stopped-flow mixing. The rates for fast and slow fluorescence-detected refolding are unchanged, while fast unfolding is increased in rate 3-fold in the mutant protein compared to normal iso-2. A new kinetic phase in the 1-s time range is observed in fluorescence-detected unfolding of the mutant protein. The presence of the new phase is correlated with the presence of species with an altered folded conformation in the initial conditions, suggesting assignment of the phase to unfolding of this species. The fluorescence-detected and absorbance-detected slow folding phases have been monitored as a function of final pH by manual mixing between pH 5.5 and 8 (0.3 M guanidine hydrochloride, 20 degrees C).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Formation of the MetJ:SAM:DNA ternary complex is significantly more exothermic (delta H congruent to -99 kJ.mol-1) than either MetJ:DNA or MetJ:SAM binary complexes alone (delta H congruent to -10 kJ.mol-1 each). The protein is also significantly more stable to unfolding (delta Tm congruent to 5.4 degrees C) when bound to DNA. These observations suggest that binding of SAM to the protein-DNA complex leads to a significant reduction in dynamic flexibility of the ternary complex, with considerable entropy-enthalpy compensation, not necessarily involving any overall conformational change.",

        "abstract": "There is little information on the egg proteins of gastropod mollusks. Here we focus on PV2, a novel neurotoxin from snail eggs, studying its size, shape, structure, and stability, using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, electron microscopy and partial proteolysis. Results indicate that PV2 is a compact and well folded oligomer of 130x44 A. It is an octamer of four 98 kDa heterodimers composed of 67 and 31 kDa subunits. Subunits are held together by disulfide bonds. Dimers are assembled into native PV2 by non-covalent forces. The larger subunit is more susceptible to proteolysis, indicating it is less compactly folded and/or more exposed. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence showed a single class of tryptophyl side chains occluded in hydrophobic regions. Native structure shows loss of secondary structure (alpha+beta) at 6 M urea or 60-70 degrees C; the effects on the quaternary structure suggest an unfolding without disassembling of the protein. The 3D model of PV2 presented here is the first for an egg proteinaceous neurotoxin in animals.",

Polyethylene glycol of low Mw favours the ionization of the tyrosine (TYR) residues of albumin. Such variation might be a consequence of the change in dielectric constant at the domain of the protein by PEG binding. PEGs of high Mws stabilize the native compact state of human albumin showing negative preferential interaction with the protein. Interaction between PEGs and albumin is thermodynamically unfavourable, and becomes even more unfavourable for denatured proteins whose surface areas are larger than those of native ones leading to a stabilization of the unfolded state, which is manifested as a lowering of the thermal transition temperature. PEG 8000 perturbs the structure of the protein surface, partially modifying the layer of water and the microenvironment of the superficial aromatic residues (tryptophan, TRP and TYR) which is in agreement with the modifications of the UV spectrum of albumin by PEG 8000 and circular dichroism (CD) spectrum at high temperatures.",

        "abstract": "The effect of membrane binding on the structure and stability of the cytotoxin alpha-sarcin has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. The thermal unfolding of alpha-sarcin in aqueous solution fits into a two-state transition characterized by a transition temperature (Tm) of 52.6 degrees C and a calorimetric enthalpy (delta Hcal) of 136 kcal/mol. Upon interaction with phosphatidylglycerol vesicles, alpha-sarcin undergoes conformational changes, as deduced from the FTIR and fluorescence emission spectra. These changes result in a decreased Tm and delta Hcal values for the thermal unfolding of phospholipid-bound alpha-sarcin. The lower Tm value for lipid-bound alpha-sarcin is also observed at the level of secondary and tertiary structures, based on analyses of both the amide I' infrared spectrum and the tryptophan emission of the protein as a function of temperature, respectively. The results obtained indicate a protein destabilization promoted by the phospholipid interaction.",

        "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to investigate the thermal stability of three different ceruloplasmins (from sheep, chicken, and turtle) in their native state and after limited proteolysis. The three undegraded proteins showed a similar structural organization in three calorimetric domains, although their temperature of unfolding varied from 57.8 degrees C (turtle) to 71.2 degrees C (sheep) to 82.1 degrees C (chicken). The spectroscopic and the catalytic properties were totally lost at temperatures corresponding to the unfolding of the less thermostable domain in the case of sheep and chicken ceruloplasmins and to the unfolding of the most thermostable domain in the turtle protein. Trypsin, but not plasmin, digestion caused a significant decrease of the thermal stability of sheep and chicken ceruloplasmins. Turtle ceruloplasmin was insensitive to both proteases. Comparing the thermodynamic parameters of the sheep protein in its undegraded and cleaved states revealed a mismatch between the three calorimetric domains and the 3-fold internal replication of the primary structure, which is evident in the highly homologous, fully sequenced human protein. Copper removal caused the rearrangement of the molecule in only two calorimetric domains, suggesting a role of the metal atoms in organizing a new calorimetric domain, which was tentatively assigned to the less thermostable cooperative unit of the native protein.",

        "abstract": "Chicken apocytochrome c has been shown to possess a much stronger tendency to fold spontaneously in aqueous solution than the equivalent enzyme from other species. In the present work, the amino acid that determines its folding ability was elucidated by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type chicken apocytochrome c and three mutants V92A, S103A, and V92A/S103A were expressed in Escherichia coli. The wild-type apoprotein and S103A exhibited the same folding property during dialysis renaturation processes as that chemically prepared from chicken cytochrome c, while those containing V92A mutation did not. Quantitative studies by 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) titration demonstrated that the V92A mutation decreased the helix content that could be induced and confirmed that valine 92 is the major determinant of the folding propensity of chicken apocytochrome c. Furthermore, CD spectra, turbidity measurements, and a translocation assay on a model membrane system showed that the V92A mutation also drastically altered the conformation of apocytochrome c after being incorporated into lipid bilayer and decreased the aggregation of phospholipid vesicles after association of the apoprotein, thus rendering the molecule more competent for translocation across the membrane. Our results showed that a single amino acid substitution could radically alter the folding propensity of an unfolded polypeptide chain and thus influence the conformation following its insertion into phospholipid bilayer.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the contribution of hydrogen bonds by tyrosine -OH groups to protein stability. The amino acid sequences of RNases Sa and Sa3 are 69 % identical and each contains eight Tyr residues with seven at equivalent structural positions. We have measured the stability of the 16 tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants. For two equivalent mutants, the stability increases by 0.3 kcal/mol (RNase Sa Y30F) and 0.5 kcal/mol (RNase Sa3 Y33F) (1 kcal=4.184 kJ). For all of the other mutants, the stability decreases with the greatest decrease being 3.6 kcal/mol for RNase Sa Y52F. Seven of the 16 tyrosine residues form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the average decrease in stability for these is 2.0(+/-1.0) kcal/mol. For the nine tyrosine residues that do not form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the average decrease in stability is 0.4(+/-0.6) kcal/mol. Thus, most tyrosine -OH groups contribute favorably to protein stability even if they do not form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Generally, the stability changes for equivalent positions in the two proteins are remarkably similar. Crystal structures were determined for two of the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of RNase Sa: Y80F (1.2 A), and Y86F (1.7 A). The structures are very similar to that of wild-type RNase Sa, and the hydrogen bonding partners of the tyrosine residues always form intermolecular hydrogen bonds to water in the mutants. These results provide further evidence that the hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions of polar groups in the tightly packed interior of folded proteins are more favorable than similar interactions with water in the unfolded protein, and that polar group burial makes a substantial contribution to protein stability.",

        "abstract": "The structure of insulin exhibits local and nonlocal differences among crystal forms and so provides an important model for analysis of protein dynamics. A novel combination of order and disorder has recently been inferred from 2D-NMR studies of the monomeric analogue des-pentapeptide(B26-B30) insulin (DPI) under acidic conditions [the molten-globule hypothesis; Hua, Q.X., Kochoyan, M., & Weiss, M.A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 2379-2383]. Distance-geometry structures are similar in general to crystal structures but differ by rigid-body displacements of alpha-helices; the hydrophobic core is not well ordered due to insufficient long-range restraints. To test whether such informational uncertainty may represent physical disorder, we have performed complementary studies of the thermal unfolding of DPI and its interaction with 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS). Experimental design is based on a predicted analogy between DPI and A-state models of protein-folding intermediates (the \"molten globule\"). Unfolding is monitored by five distinct biophysical probes: photochemical dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), 1H-NMR chemical shifts, and slowly exchanging amide 1H-NMR resonances in D2O solution. The results provide evidence that DPI adopts a compact partially folded state. Because the 2D-NMR spectrum of an engineered insulin monomer under physiological conditions is similar to that of DPI under acidic conditions [Weiss, M.A., Hua, Q.X., Frank, B.H., Lynch, C., & Shoelson, S.E. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7373-7389], we propose that the functional form of insulin is a molten globule.",

        "abstract": "The crystal structures of two thermally stabilized subtilisin BPN' variants, S63 and S88, are reported here at 1.8 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. The micromolar affinity calcium binding site (site A) has been deleted (Delta75-83) in these variants, enabling the activity and thermostability measurements in chelating conditions. Each of the variants includes mutations known previously to increase the thermostability of calcium-independent subtilisin in addition to new stabilizing mutations. S63 has eight amino acid replacements: D41A, M50F, A73L, Q206W, Y217K, N218S, S221C, and Q271E. S63 has 75-fold greater stability than wild type subtilisin in chelating conditions (10 mm EDTA). The other variant, S88, has ten site-specific changes: Q2K, S3C, P5S, K43N, M50F, A73L, Q206C, Y217K, N218S, and Q271E. The two new cysteines form a disulfide bond, and S88 has 1000 times greater stability than wild type subtilisin in chelating conditions. Comparisons of the two new crystal structures (S63 in space group P2(1) with A cell constants 41.2, 78.1, 36.7, and beta = 114.6 degrees and S88 in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with cell constants 54.2, 60.4, and 82.7) with previous structures of subtilisin BPN' reveal that the principal changes are in the N-terminal region. The structural bases of the stabilization effects of the new mutations Q2K, S3C, P5S, D41A, Q206C, and Q206W are generally apparent. The effects are attributed to the new disulfide cross-link and to improved hydrophobic packing, new hydrogen bonds, and other rearrangements in the N-terminal region.",

By exploiting the thermodynamic linkage between ligand binding and stability, interactions of a protein with small molecules, nucleic acids, or other proteins can be detected and quantified. Determination of protein stability can therefore provide a universal monitor of biochemical function. Yet, the use of stability measurements as a functional probe is underutilized, because such experiments traditionally require large amounts of protein and special instrumentation. Here we present the quantitative cysteine reactivity (QCR) technique to determine protein stabilities rapidly and accurately using only picomole quantities of material and readily accessible laboratory equipment. We demonstrate that QCR-derived stabilities can be used to measure ligand binding over a wide range of ligand concentrations and affinities.

        "abstract": "The denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding of octameric mitochondrial creatine kinase, dimeric cytosolic muscle-type creatine kinase, and monomeric arginine kinase was investigated. Stable unfolding intermediates for all three enzymes were manifested by a strongly biphasic red shift of intrinsic protein fluorescence upon increasing denaturant concentrations. In the intermediate state, all proteins were monomeric and enzymatically inactive, but still retained a globular shape. Native tertiary structure interactions were largely disrupted, while at least 50% of the secondary structures were conserved, as suggested by near- and far-UV circular dichroism, respectively. A significantly increased surface hydrophobicity of the intermediate conformation, compared to both the native and the fully unfolded states, was observed by the binding of the hydrophobic fluorescent dye ANS. The observed properties agree formally with the definition of the molten globule state, but can be alternatively explained by a sequential unfolding of individual domains, involving a transient exposure of domain interfaces. Very similar unfolding profiles for all three proteins suggest that the formation of stable unfolding intermediates is not a consequence of the specific oligomeric structures of the CKs but rather due to a common, probably two-domain architecture of the guanidino kinase protomers.",

This allowed comparison of T. maritima CheY with B. subtilis CheY and determination of the thermodynamic qualities responsible for the enhanced thermostability of T. maritima CheY. The stability of the thermophilic CheY protein is a direct result of the increased enthalpy contribution at the temperature of zero entropy, T(s), and the decreased heat capacity change upon unfolding, resulting in a decreased dependence of the free energy of unfolding on temperature. It was found that neither purely entropic nor purely enthalpic contributions alone (as reflected by T(s)) were sufficient to account for the increase in stability.",

Our results further reveal that the two-disulfide variant proteins, while possessing the same global fold as the wild-type, display marked differences in their folding pathway-in particular, the absence of a characteristic alpha-helix to beta-sheet transition, which is a fundamental feature associated with misfolding of proteins into amyloid fibrils, especially in the context of prion diseases. These surprising characteristics of disulfide mutant prion proteins have important implications for the understanding of the generic aberrant processes leading to amyloid fibril formation and protein aggregation, as well as providing insight into possible therapeutic strategies.",

Comparison of these data to that derived from an analysis of a large alignment of SH3 domain sequences revealed a very good correlation between the distinct pattern of conservation observed at each core position and the thermodynamic stability of mutants. Conservation was also found to correlate well with the unfolding rates of mutants, but not to the folding rates, suggesting that evolution selects more strongly for optimal native state packing interactions than for maximal folding rates. Structural analysis suggests that residue-residue core packing interactions are very similar in all SH3 domains, which provides an explanation for the correlation between conservation and mutant stability effects studied in a single SH3 domain. We also demonstrate a correlation between stability and the in vivo activity of mutants, and between conservation and activity. However, the relationship between conservation and activity was very strong only for the three most conserved hydrophobic core positions. The weaker correlation between activity and conservation seen at the other seven core positions indicates that maintenance of protein stability is the dominant selective pressure at these positions. In general, the pattern of conservation at hydrophobic core positions appears to arise from conserved packing constraints, and can be effectively utilized to predict the destabilizing effects of amino acid substitutions.",

The pKA values of the 11 residues titrating under folding conditions (above pH 2.2) were determined by two-dimensional 1H NMR. The pKA value of the remaining residue, Asp 93 which forms a salt link with Arg 69 and titrates at much lower pH values, was determined by changes in the pH dependence of the stability of the protein upon mutation to Asn: pKAsp93A at low ionic strength (50 mM) and pKAsp93A at high ionic strength (600 mM). The overall titration of the native state is nonideal, and the protein retains fractionally ionized residues other than Asp 93 throughout the experimental pH range of 0.2-6.3. Protonation events taking place at pH values below 2 were further characterized by the pH dependence of the unfolding kinetics of wild-type and charge-mutant proteins. By comparing the observed pH dependence of the protein stability with that calculated from the pKA values for the native protein, we demonstrate that the pKA values of the denatured state are significantly lower than those reported for model compounds: the pKA values of the denatured state appear on average 0.4 units lower than previous estimates in the presence of chemical denaturant. The results have direct implications for calculations of the energetics of proton equilibria and suggest that the acid/thermally denatured state is not an extended coil where the residues are isolated from one another by the intervening solvent but is compact and involves intramolecular charge repulsion.",

        "abstract": "Non-glycine residues in proteins are rarely observed to have \"left-handed helical\" conformations. For glycine, however, this conformation is common. To determine the contributions of left-handed helical residues to the stability of a protein, two such residues in phage T4 lysozyme, Asn55 and Lys124, were replaced with glycine. The mutant proteins fold normally and are fully active, showing that left-handed non-glycine residues, although rare, do not have an indispensable role in the folding of the protein or in its activity. The thermodynamic stability of the Lys124 to Gly variant is essentially identical with that of wild-type lysozyme. The Asn55 to Gly mutant protein is marginally less stable (0.5 kcal/mol). These results indicate that the conformational energy of a glycine and a non-glycine residue in the left-handed helical conformation are very similar. This is consistent with some theoretical energy distributions, but is inconsistent with others, which suggest that replacements of the sort described here might increase the stability of the protein by up to 5 kcal/mol. Crystallographic analysis of the mutant proteins shows that the backbone conformation of the Lys124 to Gly variant is essentially identical with that of the wild-type structure. In the case of the Asn55 to Gly replacement, however, the (phi, psi) values of residue 55 change by about 20 degrees. This suggests that the energy minimum for left-handed glycine residues is not the same as that for non-glycine residues. This is strongly indicated also by a survey of accurately determined protein crystal structures, which suggests that the energy minimum for left-handed glycine residues is near (phi = 90 degrees, psi = 0 degrees), whereas that for non-glycine residues is close to (phi = 60 degrees, psi = 30 degrees). This apparent energy minimum for glycine is not clearly predicted by any of the theoretical (phi, psi) energy contour maps.",

        "abstract": "The temperature-dependent conformational equilibrium of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase has been studied in the temperature range from 1 to 30 degrees C by means of dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. At 28 degrees C and in the presence of 0.7 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), the radius of gyration (RG) and the Stokes radius (RS) are 2.44 and 3.09 nm, respectively. Decreasing the temperature effects unfolding of the molecule, a process that involves two stages. The two stages correspond to the successive unfolding of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The peak maxima of the excess heat capacity, determined from differential calorimetric scans, extrapolated to 0 scan rate, are positioned at 16.5 degrees C for the N-terminal domain and at 6.3 degrees C for the C-terminal domain. At 4.5 degrees C, the radius of gyration and the Stokes radius increase to 7.8 and 4.8 nm, respectively. The persistence length and the length of the statistical chain segment of the unfolded polypeptide chain are 1.74 and 3.48 nm, corresponding to five and ten amino acids, respectively. At 1 degrees C, the dimensions of the unfolded chain nearly agree with the predicted dimensions under theta conditions. Thus, the conformational changes upon cold denaturation can be described by a transition from a compactly folded molecule to a random coil. The conformation-dependent ratio rho = RGRS-1 increases from rho = 0.79 to rho = 1.63. The volume of the unfolded chain is 30 times larger than that of the folded chain in the native state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The DNA-binding domain of the c-myb protooncogene product consists of three homologous tandem repeats of 51-52 amino acids (denoted as R1, R2, and R3 from the N-terminal side). In order to analyze conformational and thermodynamic characteristics of the homologous repeats, we have examined the DNA-binding domain by circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The CD spectra for the three individual repeats are significantly different in the fine profiles, indicating subtle differences in their conformations. The melting analyses for the fragments show that the thermal stability of each fragment is different from one another, with the following order of stability: R1(Tm = 61 degrees C) approximately greater than R3(57 degrees C) > R2(43 degrees C), where R2 is much less stable than the other repeats. The denaturing process for the whole DNA-binding domain, measured by DSC, is characterized by a very broad transition ranging from 30 to 80 degrees C. The denaturation curve can be fit well by a three-state transition with one intermediate state. The transition temperature for the native-to-intermediate transition coincides with the melting temperature of R2, indicating that the intermediate state corresponds to the unfolding of unstable R2. The CD spectrum of the whole domain is almost identical to the sum of the individual spectra. Thus, these results suggest that the individual repeats in the whole DNA-binding domain behave independently in terms of conformation and stability. The addition of DNA to the DNA-binding fragment drastically changed the melting profile, in which the broad transition curve was replaced by a sharp peak at 58 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Two single amino acid mutant proteins of beta-lactamase PC1 from Staphylococcus aureus, P2 Thr40----Ile and P54 Asp146----Asn, have been investigated using urea-gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism and sedimentation velocity. Investigation of the folded states of the mutants has shown that compared to wild-type PC1 they are slightly more expanded, and have reduced aromatic circular dichroism, but the same content of secondary structure as PC1. The mutants exhibit fast refolding kinetics to the folded state, in contrast to PC1, which refolds only slowly. We conclude from these results that the folded mutants are in a state close to but distinct from the native state of PC1 and have certain properties in common with the compact intermediate in the folding of beta-lactamase. Therefore, these single amino acid substitutions result in a folding pathway blocked at a point located after collapse of the already folded structural units into a globular shape, and close to the final reshuffling step that leads to the native state of the wild-type enzyme.",

        "abstract": "In order to determine the role of the C-terminal helix in the folding and stability of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase, a mutant deleted of the 12 C-terminal residues (PGK delta 404-415) was constructed. This mutant folds in a conformation very similar to that of the wild-type protein, but exhibits a very low activity (0.1% of that of the wild-type enzyme). The main structural effect of the deletion of the C-terminal helix is an increase in flexibility of the whole protein and a decrease in stability by about 5 kcal/mol. The structural properties of the truncated protein are very similar, at least qualitatively, to those in the isolated domains. The accessibility of the thiol group of Cys 97 is identical to that in the isolated N-domain. The large solvent effect on the tryptophan fluorescence in the native protein at very low concentration of denaturant reveals an increase of flexibility of the C-domain, similar to that observed on the isolated C-domain. NMR measurements show that the pH dependence of His C2H and C4H chemical shifts in the truncated protein perfectly matches those of the isolated domains. The addition of the missing peptide provokes a 40-fold increase in enzyme activity at saturation. A dissociation constant of 80 microM was determined. This peptide, which displays a random structure in solution, folds in a helical structure in the region 405-410 as assessed by TRNOESY. All these results show that the C-terminal part of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase is not necessary for most of the initial folding steps but acts to lock the C-domain on the N-domain, thus ensuring the expression of full enzyme activity. Without this sequence, the protein has the sum of the properties of the two isolated domains.",

In pursuit of delineating the structural-functional features of Escherichia coli PDF (EcPDF), we investigated the mechanistic pathway for the guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced unfolding of the enzyme by monitoring the secondary structural changes via CD spectroscopy. The experimental data revealed that EcPDF is a highly stable enzyme, and it undergoes slow denaturation in the presence of varying concentrations of GdmCl. The most interesting aspect of these studies has been the abrupt reversal of the unfolding pathway at low to moderate concentrations of the denaturant, but not at high concentration. An energetic rationale for such an unprecedented feature in protein chemistry is offered.",

The removal of a single hydroxyl group from the hydrophobic core of HT, through the replacement of a Tyr by Phe, resulted in further elevation of the T(m) value of the oxidized form by approximately 6 degrees C, the T(m) value of the reduced one remaining essentially unaltered. As a result, the redox potential of the mutant with higher stability in the oxidized form exhibited a negative shift of approximately 20 mV relative to that of wild-type HT in an enthalpic manner. These findings indicated that the redox function of a protein can be enthalpically regulated through the stability of the oxidized form by altering the contextual stereochemical packing of hydrophobic residues in the protein interior using protein engineering.",

        "abstract": "Pepsin, a gastric aspartic proteinase, is a zymogen-derived protein that undergoes irreversible alkaline denaturation at pH 6-7. Detailed knowledge of the structure of the alkaline-denatured state is an important step in understanding the mechanism of the formation of the active enzyme. An extensive analysis of the denatured state at pH 8.0 was performed using a variety of techniques including (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and solution X-ray scattering. This analysis indicates that the denatured state under these conditions has a compact and globular conformation with a substantial amount of secondary and tertiary structures. The data suggest that this partially structured species has a highly folded region and a flexible region. The NMR measurements suggest that the folded region contains His53 and is located at least partly in the N-terminal lobe of the protein. The alkaline-denatured state experiences a further reversible denaturation step at higher pH or on heating; the midpoints of the unfolding transition are pH 11.5 (at 25 degrees C) and 53.1 degrees C (at pH 8.0), respectively. The present findings suggest that the proteolytic processing of pepsinogen has substantially modified the ability of the protein to fold, such that its folding process cannot progress beyond the partially folded intermediate of pepsin.",

        "abstract": "The burial of nonpolar surface area is known to enhance markedly the conformational stability of proteins. The contribution from the burial of polar surface area is less clear. Here, we report on the tolerance to substitution of Ser75 of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A), a residue that has the unusual attributes of being buried, conserved, and polar. To identify variants that retain biological function, we used a genetic selection based on the intrinsic cytotoxicity of ribonucleolytic activity. Cell growth at 30 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 44 degrees C correlated with residue size, indicating that the primary attribute of Ser75 is its small size. The side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser75 forms a hydrogen bond with a main-chain nitrogen. The conformational stability of the S75A variant, which lacks this hydrogen bond, was diminished by DeltaDeltaG = 2.5 kcal/mol. Threonine, which can reinstate this hydrogen bond, provided a catalytically active RNase A variant at higher temperatures than did some smaller residues (including aspartate), indicating that a secondary attribute of Ser75 is the ability of its uncharged side chain to accept a hydrogen bond. These results provide insight on the imperatives for the conservation of a buried polar residue.",

        "abstract": "In several experimental techniques D2O rather then H2O is often used as a solvent for proteins. Concerning the influence of the solvent on the stability of the proteins, contradicting results have been reported in literature. In this paper the influence of H2O-D2O solvent substitution on the stability of globular protein structure is determined in a systematic way. The differential scanning calorimetry technique is applied to allow for a thermodynamic analysis of two types of globular proteins: hen's egg lysozyme (LSZ) with relatively strong internal cohesion (\"hard\" globular protein) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is known for its conformational adaptability (\"soft\" globular protein). Both proteins tend to be more stable in D2O compared to H2O. We explain the increase of protein stability in D2O by the observation that D2O is a poorer solvent for nonpolar amino acids than H2O, implying that the hydrophobic effect is larger in D2O. In case of BSA the transitions between different isomeric forms, at low pH values the Nm and F forms, and at higher pH values Nm and B, were observed by the presence of a supplementary peak in the DSC thermogram. It appears that the pH-range for which the Nm form is the preferred one is wider in D2O than in H2O.",

        "abstract": "To examine the importance of side chain packing to protein stability, each of the 11 leucines in staphylococcal nuclease was substituted with isoleucine and valine. The nine valines were substituted with leucine and isoleucine, while the five isoleucines, previously substituted with valine, were substituted with leucine and methionine. These substitutions conserve the hydrophobic character of these side chains but alter side chain geometry and, in some cases, size. In addition, eight threonine residues, previously substituted with valine, were substituted with isoleucine to test the importance of packing at sites normally not occupied by a hydrophobic residue. The stabilities of these 58 mutant proteins were measured by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest library of single packing mutants yet characterized. As expected, repacking stability effects are tied to the degree of side chain burial. The average energetic cost of moving a single buried methyl group was 0.9 kcal/mol, albeit with a standard deviation of 0.8 kcal/mol. This average is actually slightly greater than the value of 0.7-0.8 kcal/mol estimated for the hydrophobic transfer energy of a methylene from octanol to water. These results appear to indicate that van der Waals interactions gained from optimal packing are at least as important in stabilizing the native state of proteins as hydrophobic transfer effects.",

        "abstract": "All 44 possible double mutant permutations of isoleucine, leucine, and valine were constructed in 11 pairings of six sites in the core of staphylococcal nuclease. The stabilities of these mutants were determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. Comparison of the stabilities of all double mutants with those expected from addition of the corresponding single mutants showed that the effects of the two single mutations are energetically independent of each other in 30 of the double mutants. However, a substantial minority, 14, of the double mutants have stability effects that are not additive. In these cases, it appears that direct van der Waals contacts between the two side chains are present. The requirement of direct van der Waals contact for the interdependence of mutational stability effects is somewhat surprising in light of results previously reported by others. In addition, it was found that double mutants that did not alter or lower the overall number of atoms in the core and that showed nonadditive behavior were more stable than expected from addition of the effects of the corresponding single mutants. A net increase in the number of atoms in the core usually, but not always, resulted in a mutant that was less stable than expected. In contrast to previous staphylococcal nuclease double mutants, energetically significant changes to the denatured state do not appear to be occurring in these packing mutants. These conclusions imply that attempts to engineer protein stability based on single mutant data will be generally successful if overall core size is preserved and if residues are not in van der Waals contact.",

This is the first time that a large number of multiple mutants with all possible variations and all possible lower-order mutants has been systematically constructed in any protein core. Stabilities were determined by solvent denaturation. The energetic effects of these multiple mutants have been analyzed in combination with the stability data from the component single and double mutants. It was found that most of the stability changes in triple and quadruple mutants cannot be correctly predicted from stability effects of component single mutants. However, if the interaction energy between pairs of side chains in the component double mutants is taken into account, correct stability prediction can be made for most triple and quadruple mutants. The data further show that while packing interactions unique to triple and quadruple mutations do occur, they are of much less energetic significance than interactions between pairs of residues. The results presented here show that the packing of a protein interior can be closely approximated in most cases as a series of short-range, nearest-neighbor interactions. This has profound implications for rational protein design and structure prediction.",

        "abstract": "One of the necessary conditions for a protein to be foldable is the presence of a complete set of folding elements (FEs) that are short contiguous peptide segments distributed over an amino acid sequence. Previous studies indicated the FE assembly model of protein folding, in which the FEs interact with each other and coalesce to form an intermediate(s) early in the folding reaction. This suggests that a clue to the understanding of the determinants of protein foldability can be found by investigating how the FEs interact with each other early in the folding and thereby elucidating roles of the FEs in protein folding. To reveal the formation process of FE-FE interactions, we studied the early folding events of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) utilizing systematic sequence perturbation analysis. Here, systematic single amino acid substitutions were introduced inside of the FEs (W30X in FE2, V40X in FE3, N59X in FE4, and I155X in FE10; X refers to various amino acid residues), and their kinetic refolding reactions were measured by stopped-flow circular dichroism and fluorescence. We show that the interactions around Trp30 and Ile155 are formed in the burst phase intermediate, while those around Val40 and Asn59 are formed in the transition state of the subsequent folding phase (tau5-phase) and in much later processes, respectively. These and previous results suggest that FE2 and FE10, and also FE1 and FE7, involved in the loop subdomain of DHFR, interact with each other within a millisecond time range, while the stable FE3-FE4 interactions are formed in the later processes. This may highlight the important roles of the FEs mainly inside of the loop subdomain in formation of the burst phase intermediate having a hydrophobic cluster and native-like overall topology and in acquisition of the foldability of DHFR.",

        "abstract": "The thermal stability of cholera toxin free in solution and in association with its cell-surface receptor ganglioside GM1 has been studied by using high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and differential solubility thermal gel analysis. In the absence of ganglioside GM1, cholera toxin undergoes two distinct thermally induced transitions centered at 51 and 74 degrees C, respectively. The low-temperature transition has been assigned to the irreversible thermal denaturation of the active A subunit. The second transition has been assigned to the reversible unfolding of the B subunit pentamer. The isolated B subunit pentamer exhibits a single transition also centered at 74 degrees C, suggesting that the attachment of the A subunit does not contribute to the stability of the pentamer. In the intact toxin, the A subunit dissociates from the B subunit pentamer at a temperature that coincides with the onset of the B subunit thermal unfolding. In aqueous solution, the denatured A subunit precipitates after dissociation from the B subunit pentamer. This phenomenon can be detected calorimetrically by the appearance of an exothermic heat effect. In the presence of ganglioside GM1, the B subunit is greatly stabilized as indicated by an increase of 20 degrees C in the transition temperature. In addition, ganglioside GM1 greatly enhances the cooperative interactions between B subunits. In the absence of ganglioside, each monomer within the B pentamer unfolds in an independent fashion whereas the fully ganglioside-bound pentamer behaves as a single cooperative unit. On the contrary, the thermotropic behavior of the A subunit is only slightly affected by the presence of increasing concentrations of ganglioside GM1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The shape and the energetics of a functional cavity in the R2 subdomain (90-141) of the c-Myb DNA-binding domain were investigated by spectroscopy and thermodynamic analysis. We focused on the valine 103 residue located in front of the cavity. Nine mutants, in which valine 103 was substituted with alanine, 2-aminobutyric acid, norvaline, norleucine, leucine, isoleucine, allo -isoleucine, cyclohexylglycine, and cyclohexylalanine, were chemically synthesized and analyzed. These mutants provided a wide distribution of sizes which ranged from forming additional cavity space to filling and overflowing the cavity space. Temperature-scanning circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry revealed a linear relationship between the van't Hoff enthalpy and the thermal transition temperature for the cavity-filling mutations. On the other hand, the mutants with side-chains larger than the side-chain of leucine resulted in a relatively low transition enthalpy and temperature, most likely due to the exposure of the side-chain to solvent and the increase in the entropy of the folded states. Branching at the beta-carbon atom reduced the unfolding free energy due to the steric constraint in the cavity. In particular, the mutational elongation of the side-chain from beta-carbon to the trans -to-CO direction proved to be more hindered than that from beta-carbon to the trans -to-NH. The unfolding free energy versus side-chain volume formed a bell-shaped plot with a maximum free energy for the leucine mutant. The difference in the transition free energy for cavity-filling mutants with beta-unbranched side-chains were two to four times larger than the difference in the transfer energy from organic solvent to water. Therefore, the increase in unfolding free energy would most likely be attributed to van der Waals interactions in the cavity wall, which would be a origin of stabilization by the sliding of tryptophan 95 into the cavity upon DNA binding.",

        "abstract": "Structural studies on G-protein-coupled receptors have been hampered for many years by their instability in detergent solution and by the number of potential conformations that receptors can adopt. Recently, the structures of the beta(1) and beta(2) adrenergic receptors and the adenosine A(2a) receptor were determined in the antagonist-bound state, a receptor conformation that is thought to be more stable than the agonist-bound state. In contrast to these receptors, the neurotensin (NT) receptor NTS1 is much less stable in detergent solution. We have therefore used a systematic mutational approach coupled with activity assays to identify receptor mutants suitable for crystallization, both alone and in complex with the peptide agonist NT. The best receptor mutant NTS1-7m contained four point mutations. It showed increased stability compared to the wild-type receptor, in the absence of ligand, after solubilization with a variety of detergents. In addition, NTS1-7m bound to NT was more stable than unliganded NTS1-7m. Of the four thermostabilizing mutations, only one residue (A86L) is predicted to be in the lipid environment. In contrast, I260A appears to be buried within the transmembrane helix bundle, F342A may form a distant part of the putative ligand-binding site, whereas F358A is likely to be in a region that is important for receptor activation. NTS1-7m binds NT with a similar affinity for the wild-type receptor. However, agonist dissociation was slower, and NTS1-7m activated G-proteins poorly. The affinity of NTS1-7m for the antagonist SR48692 was also lower than that of the wild-type receptor. Thus, we have successfully stabilized NTS1 in an agonist-binding conformation that does not efficiently couple to G-proteins.",

        "abstract": "In order to understand the contribution of hydrophobic residues to the conformational stability of human lysozyme, five Ile mutants (Ile --> Val) in the interior of the protein were constructed. The thermodynamic parameters characterizing the denaturation of these mutant proteins were determined by scanning calorimetry, and the three-dimensional structure of each mutant protein was solved at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. The thermodynamic analyses at 64.9 degrees C and at pH 2.7 revealed the following. (1) The stabilities of all the mutant proteins were decreased as compared with that of the wild-type protein. (2) The changes in the calorimetric enthalpies were larger than those in the Gibbs energies, and were compensated by entropy changes. (3) The destabilization mechanism of the mutant proteins differs, depending on the location of the mutation sites. X-ray analyses showed that the overall structures of all the mutant human lysozymes examined were identical to that of the wild-type protein, and only small structural rearrangements were observed locally around some of the mutation sites. The most striking change among the mutant proteins was found in the mutant protein, 159V, which contains a new water molecule in the cavity created by the mutation. The thermodynamic stabilities of the mutant proteins are discussed in light of the high-resolution X-ray structures of the wild-type and five mutant human lysozymes examined.",

The abilities of TF to associate with Factor VIIa and Factor X in a ternary complex and to enable proteolytic activation of Factor X by Factor VIIa reside in the extracellular domain of TF. We describe the expression of the surface domain of TF (truncated TF, tTF) in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli and the biochemical and physical characterization of the recombinant proteins. Wild-type tTF and several glycosylation-site mutants were secreted efficiently by S. cerevisiae under the control of the yeast prepro-alpha-signal sequence; the T13A,N137D double mutant was the most homogeneous variant expressed in milligram quantities. Wild-type tTF was expressed in a non-native state in E. coli inclusion bodies as a fusion protein with a poly(His) leader. The fusion protein could be fully renatured and the leader removed by proteolysis with thrombin; the correct molecular mass (24,729 Da) of the purified protein was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Recombinant tTFs from yeast, E. coli and Chinese hamster ovary cells were identical in their abilities to bind Factor VIIa, to enhance the catalytic activity of Factor VIIa and to enhance the proteolytic activation of Factor X by Factor VIIa. Furthermore, CD, fluorescence emission and NMR spectra of the yeast and E. coli proteins indicated that these proteins are essentially identical structurally.",

        "abstract": "Six individual amino acid substitutions at separate positions in the tertiary structure of subtilisin BPN' (EC 3.4.21.14) were found to increase the stability of this enzyme, as judged by differential scanning calorimetry and decreased rates of thermal inactivation. These stabilizing changes, N218S, G169A, Y217K, M50F, Q206C, and N76D, were discovered through the use of five different investigative approaches: (1) random mutagenesis; (2) design of buried hydrophobic side groups; (3) design of electrostatic interactions at Ca2+ binding sites; (4) sequence homology consensus; and (5) serendipity. Individually, the six amino acid substitutions increase the delta G of unfolding between 0.3 and 1.3 kcal/mol at 58.5 degrees C. The combination of these six individual stabilizing mutations together into one subtilisin BPN' molecule was found to result in approximately independent and additive increases in the delta G of unfolding to give a net increase of 3.8 kcal/mol (58.5 degrees C). Thermodynamic stability was also shown to be related to resistance to irreversible inactivation, which included elevated temperatures (65 degrees C) or extreme alkalinity (pH 12.0). Under these denaturing conditions, the rate of inactivation of the combination variant is approximately 300 times slower than that of the wild-type subtilisin BPN'. A comparison of the 1.8-A-resolution crystal structures of mutant and wild-type enzymes revealed only independent and localized structural changes around the site of the amino acid side group substitutions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Three wild-type cold shock proteins taken from mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic bacteria are studied using these methods. The model is validated by comparison with experimental data collected for these proteins. In addition, a number of single point mutants and three designed sequences are examined. The results from this study demonstrate that the sensitivity of protein stability toward salt is correlated with thermostability in the cold shock protein family. The calculations indicate that the mesophile is stabilized by the presence of salt while the thermophile and hyperthermophile are destabilized. A decomposition of the salt influence at a residue level permits identification of regions of the protein sequences that contribute toward the observed salt-dependent stability. This model is used to rationalize the effect of various point mutations with regard to sensitivity toward salt. Finally, it is demonstrated that designed cold shock protein variants exhibit electrostatic properties similar to the natural thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins.",

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli glutaredoxin (MW 9700) catalyzes intracellular redox reactions utilizing a disulfide/dithiol enzymatic mechanism involving the active-site residues -Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys-. It is functionally related to the thioredoxin family and is expected to share similar three-dimensional structure [Eklund, H., Cambillau, C., Sj\u00f6berg, B.-M., Holmgren, A., J\u00f6rnvall, H., H\u00f6\u00f6g, J.-O., & Br\u00e4nd\u00e9n, C.-I. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 1443-1449]. We constructed an overexpression system in which production of glutaredoxin is controlled by temperature-sensitive expression of the phage T7 promoter. In addition to glutaredoxin, a second gene product is observed; this species, which we call glutaredoxin N, is glutaredoxin extended by the sequence Met-Arg-Arg-Glu-Ile- at the N terminus. We have begun characterization of the structure and stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of glutaredoxin (grx-S2 and grx-(SH)2, respectively). Secondary structure calculated from CD data agrees with that predicted from the three-dimensional model of Eklund et al. The cooperative denaturation reactions of oxidized and reduced glutaredoxin were measured in temperature-induced and guanidine hydrochloride induced unfolding experiments. Surprisingly, oxidized and reduced glutaredoxins are very similar in stability. In heat-induced denaturation, monitored by CD, Tm is 55 and 57 degrees C for oxidized and reduced, respectively. In GuHCl denaturation, monitored by fluorescence, the midpoint denaturant concentrations are 2 M for both oxidized and reduced. It follows that the redox potentials of the disulfide bond are similar in unfolded and folded glutaredoxin. This is unexpected because in E. coli thioredoxin the oxidized form is far more stable than the reduced [Kelley, R.F., Shalongo, W., Jagannadham, M.V., & Stellwagen, E. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 1406-1411] and the redox potential of folded thioredoxin is significantly more negative than that of unfolded thioredoxin [Lin, T.-Y., & Kim, P.

        "abstract": "Here we report the conformational stability of homodimeric desulfoferrodoxin (dfx) from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC 27774). The dimer is formed by two dfx monomers linked through beta-strand interactions in two domains; in addition, each monomer contains two different iron centers: one Fe-(S-Cys)(4) center and one Fe-[S-Cys+(N-His)(4)] center. The dissociation constant for dfx was determined to be 1 microM (DeltaG = 34 kJ/mol of dimer) from the concentration dependence of aromatic residue emission. Upon addition of the chemical denaturant guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) to dfx, a reversible fluorescence change occurred at 2-3 M GuHCl. This transition was dependent upon protein concentration, in accord with a dimer to monomer reaction [DeltaG(H(2)O) = 46 kJ/mol of dimer]. The secondary structure did not disappear, according to far-UV circular dichroism (CD), until 6 M GuHCl was added; this transition was reversible (for incubation times of < 1 h) and independent of dfx concentration [DeltaG(H(2)O) = 50 kJ/mol of monomer]. Thus, dfx equilibrium unfolding is at least three-state, involving a monomeric intermediate with native-like secondary structure. Only after complete polypeptide unfolding (and incubation times of > 1 h) did the iron centers dissociate, as monitored by disappearance of ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorption, fluorescence of an iron indicator, and reactivity of cysteines to Ellman's reagent. Iron dissociation took place over several hours and resulted in an irreversibly denatured dfx. It appears as if the presence of the iron centers, the amino acid composition, and, to a lesser extent, the dimeric structure are factors that aid in facilitating dfx's unusually high thermodynamic stability for a mesophilic protein.",

It consists of two subunits - one small (29 amino acid residues) and one large (86 amino acids residues) - held together by disulfide bonds. The thermal unfolding of napin has been followed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) measurements. The thermal unfolding is characterized by a three state transition with T(M1) and T(M2) at 323.5 K and 335.8 K, respectively; DeltaC(P1) and DeltaC(P2) are 2.05 kcal mol(-1) K(-1) and 1.40 kcal mol(-1) K(-1), respectively. In the temperature range 310-318 K, the molecule undergoes dimerisation. Isothermal equilibrium unfolding by guanidinium hydrochloride also follows a three state transition, N <_-_-> I <_-_-> U with DeltaG(1H2O) and DeltaG(2H2O) values of 5.2 kcal mol(-1) and 5.1 kcal mol(-1) at 300 K, respectively. Excess heat capacity values obtained, are similar to those obtained from DSC measurements. There is an increase in hydrodynamic radius from 20 A to 35.0 A due to unfolding by guanidinium hydrochloride. In silico alignment of sequences of napin has revealed that the internal repeats (40%) spanning residues 31 to 60 and 73 to 109 are conserved in all Brassica species. The internal repeats may contribute to the greater stability of napin. A thorough understanding of the structure and stability of these proteins is essential before they can be exploited for genetic improvements for nutrition.",

        "abstract": "Cocaine is considered to be the most addictive of all substances of abuse and mediates its effects by inhibiting monoamine transporters, primarily the dopamine transporters. There are currently no small molecules that can be used to combat its toxic and addictive properties, in part because of the difficulty of developing compounds that inhibit cocaine binding without having intrinsic effects on dopamine transport. Most of the effective cocaine inhibitors also display addictive properties. We have recently reported the use of cocaine esterase (CocE) to accelerate the removal of systemic cocaine and to prevent cocaine-induced lethality. However, wild-type CocE is relatively unstable at physiological temperatures (tau(1/2) approximately 13 min at 37 degrees C), presenting challenges for its development as a viable therapeutic agent. We applied computational approaches to predict mutations to stabilize CocE and showed that several of these have increased stability both in vitro and in vivo, with the most efficacious mutant (T172R/G173Q) extending half-life up to 370 min. Here we present novel X-ray crystallographic data on these mutants that provide a plausible model for the observed enhanced stability. We also more extensively characterize the previously reported variants and report on a new stabilizing mutant, L169K. The improved stability of these engineered CocE enzymes will have a profound influence on the use of this protein to combat cocaine-induced toxicity and addiction in humans.",

Both disulfide mutants are less stable and exist as molten globules in the monomeric state. Interestingly, both mutants dimerize, though with slightly lower affinities compared to the native protein. NMR studies suggest a molten globule-like structure also in the dimeric state. Structures, sequence analysis, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the conserved hydrophobic residues are packed against each other in the protein core and that H bonding and van der Waals interactions stabilize the dimer interface. Deleting either disulfide in IL-8 results in substantial loss in receptor activity, indicating that both disulfides are critical for function in the folded protein. These data together suggest that the packing interactions of the hydrophobic core determine IL-8 monomer fold, that disulfides play only a marginal role in dimer formation, and that the stability imparted by the disulfides is intimately coupled to fold and function.",

As monitored by far- and near-UV CD at 222 and 289 nm, the lack of coincidence between two unfolding transition curves was observed, which suggests the existence of a third conformational species in addition to native and unfolded states. The three-state model, in which a stable intermediate is populated, was employed to estimate the thermodynamic parameters for the GdnCl-induced unfolding. It was found that the transition from the native to intermediate states proceeds with significant changes in enthalpy and entropy due to an extremely cooperative process, while the transition from the intermediate to unfolded states shows a low cooperativity with small enthalpy and entropy changes. These results indicate that the highest energy barrier for the GdnCl-induced unfolding of hen lysozyme is located in the process from the native state to the intermediate state, and this process is largely responsible for the cooperativity of protein unfolding.",

The backbone structure of F46L, F46V, and F46A was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme, retaining the correct active site structure. However, one water molecule was included in the hydrophobic core of F46A, forming two hydrogen bonds with the backbone peptide chain. The side chain of Met29 in F46V and F46A adopted two different conformations in an equal occupancy. A trapped water molecule and two conformations of Met29 represent changes that minimize the cavity volume. Nevertheless, the replacement of Phe46 with the above residues resulted in a marked decrease in both thermal stability and folding reaction.

        "abstract": "A DNA fragment encoding Bacillus licheniformis GrpE (BlGrpE) with double mutations at codons 52 and 134 was obtained during PCR cloning. Leu52 and Leu134 in BlGrpE were individually replaced with Pro and His to generate BlGrpE-L52P and BlGrpE-L134H. BlGrpE and BlGrpE-L52P synergistically stimulated the ATPase activity of B. licheniformis DnaK (BlDnaK); however, BlGrpE-L134H and the double-mutated protein (BlGrpE-L52P/L134H) had no co-chaperone function. BlGrpE, BlGrpE-L52P, and BlGrpE-L134H mainly interacted with the monomer of BlDnaK but non-specific interaction was observed for BlGrpE-L52P/L134H. Measurement of intrinsic fluorescence revealed a significant alteration of the microenvironment of aromatic acid residues in the mutant proteins. As compared with BlGrpE, quenching of 208-nm and 222-nm signals were observed in the mutant BlGrpEs and the single-mutated proteins were more sensitive to thermal denaturation.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of hyperthermophilic microorganisms and the analysis of hyperthermostable enzymes has established the fact that multisubunit enzymes can survive for prolonged periods at temperatures above 100 degreesC. We have carried out homology-based modeling and direct structure comparison on the hexameric glutamate dehydrogenases from the hyperthermophiles Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis whose optimal growth temperatures are 100 degreesC and 88 degreesC, respectively, to determine key stabilizing features. These enzymes, which are 87% homologous, differ 16-fold in thermal stability at 104 degreesC. We observed that an intersubunit ion-pair network was substantially reduced in the less stable enzyme from T. litoralis, and two residues were then altered to restore these interactions. The single mutations both had adverse effects on the thermostability of the protein. However, with both mutations in place, we observed a fourfold improvement of stability at 104 degreesC over the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic properties of the enzymes were unaffected by the mutations. These results suggest that extensive ion-pair networks may provide a general strategy for manipulating enzyme thermostability of multisubunit enzymes. However, this study emphasizes the importance of the exact local environment of a residue in determining its effects on stability.",

        "abstract": "To determine the kinetic barrier in the folding of horse cytochrome c, a CO-liganded derivative of cytochrome c, called carbonmonoxycytochrome c, has been prepared by exploiting the thermodynamic reversibility of ferrocytochrome c unfolding induced by guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl), pH 7. The CO binding properties of unfolded ferrocytochrome c, studied by 13C NMR and optical spectroscopy, are remarkably similar to those of native myoglobin and isolated chains of human hemoglobin. Equilibrium unfolding transitions of ferrocytochrome c in the presence and the absence of CO observed by both excitation energy transfer from the lone tryptophan to the ferrous heme and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) indicate no accumulation of structural intermediates to a detectable level. Values of thermodynamic parameters obtained by two-state analysis of fluorescence transitions are DeltaG(H2O) = 11.65(+/-1.13) kcal x mol(-1) and C(m) = 3.9(+/-0.1) M GdnHCl in the presence of CO, and DeltaG(H2O)=19.3(+/-0.5) kcal x mol(-1) and C(m) = 5.1(+/-0.1) M GdnHCl in the absence of CO, indicating destabilization of ferrocytochrome c by approximately 7.65 kcal x mol(-1) due to CO binding. The native states of ferrocytochrome c and carbonmonoxycytochrome c are nearly identical in terms of structure and conformation except for the Fe2+-M80 --> Fe2+-CO replacement. Folding and unfolding kinetics as a function of GdnHCl, studied by stopped-flow fluorescence, are significantly different for the two proteins. Both refold fast, but carbonmonoxycytochrome c refolds 2-fold faster (tau = 1092 micros at 10 degrees C) than ferrocytochrome c. Linear extrapolation of the folding rates to the ordinate of the chevron plot projects this value of tau to 407 micros. The unfolding rate of the former in water, estimated by extrapolation, is faster by more than 10 orders of magnitude. Significant differences are also observed in rate-denaturant gradients in the chevron. Formation and disruption of the Fe2+-M80 coordination contact clearly impose high-energy kinetic barriers to folding and unfolding of ferrocytochrome c. The unfolding barrier due to the Fe2+-M80 bond provides sufficient kinetic stability to the native state of ferrocytochrome c to perform its physiological function as an electron donor.",

        "abstract": "The activity of human immunodeficiency virus protease is markedly increased at elevated salt concentration. The structural basis of this effect has been explored by several independent methods by using both the wild-type enzyme and its triple mutant (Q7K/L33I/L63I) (Mildner, A. M., Rothrock, D. J., Leone, J. W., Bannow, C. A., Lull, J. M., Reardon, I. M., Sarcich, J. L., Howe, W. J., Tomich, C.-S. C., Smith, C. W., Heinrikson, R. L., and Tomasselli, A. G. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 9405-9413), designed to better resist autolysis. Monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of the two enzymes during urea-mediated denaturation has shown that at high NaCl concentration, both the conformational stability ( DeltaG0) and the transition midpoint (D1/2) between the folded and unfolded states increase, indicating that the salt stabilizes the enzyme structure. These equilibrium data are supported by kinetic studies on the urea-mediated unfolding by measuring fluorescence change, red shifting in the maximum of the emission spectrum, and far- and near-UV CD. The salt effects observed in urea-mediated unfolding reactions prevail upon heat denaturation. All these findings support the existence of a two-state equilibrium between the folded and unfolded proteins. The pH dependence of fluorescence intensity indicated that the conformation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease should change in the catalytically competent pH region. It is concluded that preferential hydration stabilizes the protease structure in the presence of salt, providing entropic contribution to enhance the catalytic activity.",

(1993) Protein Eng. 6, 183-187]. In order to determine whether or not the information obtained is applicable to other regions, we prepared mutant lysozymes with Gly-Pro and Pro-Gly sequences at position 47, which is located in the beta-sheet, positions 70-71, which are located in the loop, positions 117-118, which are located in the beta-turn, and positions 121-122, which are located in the 3(10)-helix. The free energy changes of the native and mutant lysozymes for unfolding were determined at pH 5.5 and 35 degrees C. However, a mutant lysozyme with the Gly-Pro sequence was not always stabler than that with the Pro-Gly sequence at the same site. On the other hand, in order to determine whether or not strain caused by these sequences exists in the folded or unfolded state, the structures of these mutant lysozymes were determined by use of energy minimization. On comparison of the differences in the free energy change between the mutant lysozymes with Gly-Pro and Pro-Gly sequences at the same site with those in their total local conformational energies, it was found there is a good correlation between them. Therefore, it was suggested that the difference in total local conformational energy caused by the introduction of a Gly-Pro or Pro-Gly sequence could be estimated by use of the energy minimized structure. Moreover, the correlation indicated that the differences in the free energy change between Gly-Pro and Pro-Gly lysozymes may be reflected by the differences in the total local conformational energies in their folded state. It was suggested that the energy levels in the unfolded states of mutant lysozymes with Gly-Pro and Pro-Gly sequences at the same site in a Gdn-HCl solution were almost identical.",

        "abstract": "The urea-induced dissociation and subsequent conformational transitions of the nucleotide-bound form of GroEL were studied by light scattering, 4,4'-bis(1-anilino-8- naphthalenesulfonic acid) binding, and intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence. Magnesium ion alone (10 mM) stabilizes GroEL and leads to coordination of the structural transitions monitored by the different parameters. The midpoint of the light-scattering transition that monitored dissociation of the 14-mer with bound magnesium was raised to approximately 3 M, which is considerably higher than the ligand-free form of the protein, which exhibits a transition with a midpoint at approximately 2 M urea. Binding of ADP results in destabilization of the GroEL oligomeric structure, and complete dissociation of the 14-mer in the presence of 5 mM ADP occurs at about 2 M urea with the midpoint of the transition at approximately 1 M urea. The same destabilization by ADP and stabilization by Mg2+ were seen when the conformation was followed by the intrinsic fluorescence. Complexation with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, 5'-adenylimidodiphosphate gave an apparent stability of the quaternary structure that was between that observed with Mg2+ and that with ADP. The ADP-bound form of the protein demonstrated increased hydrophobic exposure at lower urea concentrations than the uncomplexed GroEL. In addition, the GroEL-ADP complex is more accessible for proteolytic digestion by chymotrypsin than the uncomplexed protein, consistent with a more open, flexible form of the protein. The implication of the conformational changes to the mechanism of the GroEL function is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to study the effect on the stability of human apomyoglobin (apoMb) of modifying the size, hydrophobicity, and charge of a central residue in the G.B helix-helix packing interface. Some stability measurements have also been made on the corresponding holomyoglobins (heme present). Cys-110, a central helix pairing residue in the G helix, has been changed to Ala, Ser, Asp, and Leu. Stability to low-pH-induced unfolding has been measured for both native apoMb and the compact folding intermediate discovered by Griko et al. [Griko, Y. V., Privalov, P. L., Venyaminov, S. Y., & Kutyshenko, V. P. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 202, 127-138]. As judged by its circular dichroism spectrum, this intermediate has a substantial helix content (about 35%). Whether or not this inferred helical structure is closely related to the myoglobin structure is not yet known. The mutational evidence shows that integrity of G.B helix pairing is important for the stability of apoMb as well as of myoglobin and that this helix pairing site is very sensitive to both steric and electrostatic disruption. Our results also suggest that G.B helix pairing does not stabilize the compact intermediate; hence, disrupting this site destabilizes the native protein relative to the compact intermediate. Such selective destabilization of the native state relative to equilibrium folding intermediates is not restricted to acid denaturation: urea denaturation of the Leu mutant appears to display at least one stable intermediate, while wild-type and the remaining mutant apoMbs undergo two-state urea unfolding transitions.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium and kinetic properties of the unfolding-refolding transitions of Escherichia coli derived rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein have been examined using several different denaturants. This protein, which contains 2 tryptophans but no prolines or cysteines, has a predominantly beta-structure: its 10 antiparallel beta-strands are organized into 2 orthogonal sheets surrounding a large solvent-filled internal cavity. For urea and guanidine hydrochloride, the completely reversible transition was monitored by circular dichroism, absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Each of these data sets was best fit by a simple, two-state model involving only native and unfolded forms. However, linear extrapolation to determine the free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant resulted in different values for the free energy of folding depending upon which denaturant was used. When fluorescence was used to monitor the transition, the extrapolated free energy estimates for the two denaturants were markedly different: 10.03 +/- 0.24 kcal mol-1 for urea versus 5.22 +/- 0.33 kcal mol-1 for guanidine hydrochloride. The midpoints of these transitions were 5.51 and 1.36 M, respectively. The transition caused by either denaturant as monitored by circular dichroism and absorbance spectroscopy was virtually coincident with that monitored by fluorescence, further supporting the assignment of a two-state model for the equilibrium results. The addition of a 2-fold molar excess of ligand (oleate) increased the extrapolated estimates approximately 2.5 kcal mol-1 for both denaturants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The unfolded (U(exch)) state of the drkN SH3 domain is significantly populated and exists in equilibrium with the folded (F(exch)) state under non-denaturing conditions near physiological pH. Denaturation experiments have been performed on the drkN SH3 domain in order to monitor the change in ellipticity, fluorescence intensity, and chemical shift between the U(exch) state and chemically or thermally denatured states. Differences between the unfolded and chemically or thermally denatured states highlight specific areas of residual structure in the unfolded state that are cooperatively disrupted upon denaturation. Results provide evidence for cooperative interactions in the unfolded state involving residues of the central beta-sheet, particularly the beta4 strand. Denaturation as well as hydrogen-exchange experiments demonstrate a non-native burial of the Trp ring within this \"cooperative\" core of the unfolded state. These findings support the presence of non-native hydrophobic clusters, organised by Trp rings, within disordered states.",

Excellent agreement was observed between experiment and the results from eight (independent) molecular dynamics simulations of unfolding at 373 K. We used a combination of heteronuclear NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations to characterise the denatured ensemble, and found that it contained very little persistent, residual structure. However, those regions that adopt helical structure in the native state were found by simulation to be poised for helix formation in the denatured state.

The denaturation profiles were analyzed to obtain the thermodynamic parameters associated with the unfolding of the protein. The data not only conform to the simple A2 if 2U model of unfolding but also are well described by the linear extrapolation model for the nature of denaturant-protein interactions. In addition, both the conformational stability (DeltaGs) and the DeltaCp for the protein unfolding is quite high, at about 18.79 kcal/mol and 5.32 kcal/(mol K), respectively, which may be a reflection of the relatively larger size of the dimeric molecule (Mr 49 000) and, perhaps, a consequent larger buried hydrophobic core in the folded protein. The simple two-state (A2 if 2U) nature of the unfolding process, with the absence of any monomeric intermediate, suggests that the quaternary interactions alone may contribute significantly to the conformational stability of the oligomer-a point that may be general to many oligomeric proteins.",

The relative stabilities, among the different sites and different variants at the same site, monitored either through the changes in the position of the maximum of the amide I' band and the tyrosine band, or the maximum of the band assigned to the beta-sheet structure, corroborate the results of a previous study using fourth-derivative UV absorbance spectroscopy. In addition, variants at position 108 are the most critical for ribonuclease structure and stability. The V108G variant seems to present a greater conformational flexibility than the other variants. The pressure- and temperature-denaturated states of all the ribonucleases characterized retained some secondary structure. However, their spectral maxima were centered at different wavenumbers, which suggests that pressure- and temperature-denaturated states do not have the same structural characteristics.

To determine if the lower stability of alpha-lactalbumin results from specific substitutions required for its adaptation to a new function, the effects of lysozyme-based and other substitutions on thermal stability were determined. Unblocking the upper cleft in alpha-lactalbumin by replacing Tyr103 with Ala, perturbs stability and structure but Pro, which also generates an open cleft, is compatible with normal structure and activity. These effects appear to reflect alternative enthalpic and entropic forms of structural stabilization by Tyr and Pro. Of 23 mutations, only three, which involve substitutions for residues in flexible substructures adjacent to the functional site, increase stability. Two are lysozyme-based substitutions for Leu110, a component of a region with alternative helix and loop conformations, and one is Asn for Lys114, a residue whose microenvironment changes when alpha-lactalbumin interacts with its target enzyme. While all substitutions for Leu110 perturb activity, a Lys114 to Asn mutation increases T(m) by more than 10 degrees C and reduces activity, but two other destabilizing substitutions do not affect activity. It is proposed that increased stability and reduced activity in Lys114Asn result from reduced flexibility in the functional site of alpha-lactalbumin.",

Its homologous N- and C-terminal domains are separated by a linker that appears disordered in NMR studies. In a study of an N-domain fragment of Paramecium CaM (PCaM1-75), the addition of linker residues 76 to 80 (MKEQD) raised the Tm by 9 degrees C and lowered calcium binding by 0.54 kcal/mol (Sorensen et al., [Biochemistry 2002;41:15-20]), showing that these tether residues affect energetics as well as being a barrier to diffusion. To determine the individual contributions of residues 74 through 80 (RKMKEQD) to stability and calcium affinity, we compared a nested series of 7 fragments (PCaM1-74 to PCaM1-80). For the first 4, PCaM1-74 through PCaM1-77, single amino acid additions at the C-terminus corresponded to stepwise increases in thermostability and decreases in calcium affinity with a net change of 13.5 degrees C in Tm and 0.55 kcal/mol in free energy. The thermodynamic properties of fragments PCaM1-77 through PCaM1-80 were nearly identical. We concluded that the 3 basic residues in the sequence from 74 to 77 (RKMK) are critical to the increased stability and decreased calcium affinity of the longer N-domain fragments. Comparisons of NMR (HSQC) spectra of 15N-PCaM1-74 and 15N-PCaM1-80 and analysis of high-resolution structural models suggest these residues are latched to amino acids in helix A of CaM. The addition of residues E78, Q79, and D80 had a minimal effect on sites I and II, but they may contribute to the mechanism of energetic communication between the domains.",

        "title": "Structure of a rapidly formed intermediate in ribonuclease T1 folding.", 
        "abstract": "Kinetic intermediates in protein folding are short-lived and therefore difficult to detect and to characterize. In the folding of polypeptide chains with incorrect isomers of Xaa-Pro peptide bonds the final rate-limiting transition to the native state is slow, since it is coupled to prolyl isomerization. Incorrect prolyl isomers thus act as effective traps for folding intermediates and allow their properties to be studied more easily. We employed this strategy to investigate the mechanism of slow folding of ribonuclease T1. In our experiments we use a mutant form of this protein with a single cis peptide bond at proline 39. During refolding, protein chains with an incorrect trans proline 39 can rapidly form extensive secondary structure. The CD signal in the amide region is regained within the dead-time of stopped-flow mixing (15 ms), indicating a fast formation of the single alpha-helix of ribonuclease T1. This step is correlated with partial formation of a hydrophobic core, because the fluorescence emission maximum of tryptophan 59 is shifted from 349 nm to 325 nm within less than a second. After about 20 s of refolding an intermediate is present that shows about 40% enzymatic activity compared to the completely refolded protein. In addition, the solvent accessibility of tryptophan 59 is drastically reduced in this intermediate and comparable to that of the native state as determined by acrylamide quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence. Activity and quenching measurements have long dead-times and therefore we do not know whether enzymatic activity and solvent accessibility also change in the time range of milliseconds. At this stage of folding at least part of the beta-sheet structure is already present, since it hosts the active site of the enzyme. The trans to cis isomerization of the tyrosine 38-proline 39 peptide bond in the intermediate and consequently the formation of native protein is very slow (tau = 6,500 s at pH 5.0 and 10 degrees C). It is accompanied by an additional increase in tryptophan fluorescence, by the development of the fine structure of the tryptophan emission spectrum, and by the regain of the full enzymatic activity. This indicates that the packing of the hydrophobic core, which involves both tryptophan 59 and proline 39, is optimized in this step. Apparently, refolding polypeptide chains with an incorrect prolyl isomer can very rapidly form partially folded intermediates with native-like properties.",

        "title": "Similar hydrophobic replacements of Leu99 and Phe153 within the core of T4 lysozyme have different structural and thermodynamic consequences.", 
        "abstract": "Two bulky amino acids within the core of phage T4 lysozyme have each been replaced in turn with a series of hydrophobic amino acids. In one set of experiments, Leu99 was replaced with Phe, Met, Ile, Val and Ala. In the second series, Phe153 was replaced with Leu, Met, Ile, Val and Ala. The double mutant in which both Leu99 and Phe153 were replaced with alanine was also constructed. The change in stability of the protein associated with each substitution and the crystal structure of each variant have been determined. In the case of replacements at position 99 the protein behaves in a relatively rigid manner, and changes very little in response to substitutions. In contrast, the protein is more flexible and adjusts much more in response to substitutions of Phe153. In both cases there is a roughly linear dependence between the stability of the mutant protein relative to wild-type (delta delta G) and the difference in the hydrophobic strength of the amino acids involved in the substitution based on solvent transfer measurements (delta delta Gtr). The change in delta delta G is, however, much greater than delta delta Gtr. For the Phe153 replacements the discrepancy is about 1.9-fold, while for the Leu99 series it is about 2.6-fold. Mutants such as Leu99-->Ala, for which the protein remains essentially rigid, tend to create larger cavities and so incur a larger energy of destabilization. Mutants such as Phe153-->Ala, for which the protein structure tends to relax, result in smaller cavities and so are less destabilized. Mutants L99I and L99V are less stable than expected from considerations of transfer free energy and cavity formation due to introduced strain caused by the replacement of Leu99 with a residue of different shape. Mutant F153L is more stable than the reference wild-type, even though the transfer free energy of Leu is less than that of Phe. The increase in stability is apparently due to torsional strain in the side-chain of Phe153 that is present in wild-type lysozyme, but is relieved in the mutant structure.",

        "abstract": "The guanidine-hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) induced unfolding and refolding characteristics of the co-chaperonin GroES from Escherichia coli, a homoheptamer of subunit molecular mass 10,000 Da, were studied by using intrinsic fluorescence, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) binding, and size-exclusion HPLC. When monitored by tyrosine fluorescence, the unfolding reaction of GroES consisted of a single transition, with a transition midpoint at around 1.0 M Gdn-HCl. Interestingly, however, ANS binding and size-exclusion HPLC experiments strongly suggested the existence of an intermediate state in the transition. In order to confirm the existence of an intermediate state between the native heptameric and unfolded monomeric states, a tryptophan residue was introduced into the interface of GroES subunits as a fluorescent probe. The unfolding reaction of GroES I48W as monitored by tryptophyl fluorescence showed a single transition curve with a transition midpoint at 0.5 M Gdn-HCl. This unfolding transition curve as well as the refolding kinetics were dependent on the concentration of GroES protein. CD spectrum and size-exclusion HPLC experiments demonstrated that the intermediates assumed a partially folded conformation at around 0.5 M Gdn-HCl. The refolding of GroES protein from 3 M Gdn-HCl was probed functionally by measuring the extent of inhibition of GroEL ATPase activity and the enhancement of lactate dehydrogenase refolding yields in the presence of GroEL and ADP. These results clearly demonstrated that the GroES heptamer first dissociated to monomers and then unfolded completely upon increasing the concentration of Gdn-HCl, and that both transitions were reversible. From the thermodynamic analysis of the dissociation reaction, it was found that the partially folded monomer was only marginally stable and that the stability of GroES protein is governed mostly by the association of the subunits.",

        "abstract": "The circular dichroism spectrum of barnase has been analyzed by examining the spectra of a series of mutants in which every single aromatic residue has been replaced. The spectrum of wild-type barnase is quite atypical for a protein of the alpha + beta class, with very low intensities and a minimum in the far-UV at 231 nm. The minimum at 231 nm is associated with the presence of Trp-94. Many other mutations involving aromatic residues have an effect on the spectral features in the far-UV. The major features in the near-UV spectra arise from essentially additive contributions of the three tryptophan residues Trp-35, Trp-71, and Trp-94. Tyrosine contributions are less prominent, with Tyr-78 and Tyr-97 contributing the most to the CD spectrum. The close charge-aromatic interaction between Trp-94 and His-18, which is important for the fluorescence properties of the protein, contributes little to the CD spectrum, as does the close aromatic-aromatic interaction between Tyr-13 and Tyr-17. However, the observed near-UV spectrum of wild-type barnase could not be simulated by the sum of the contributions of aromatic residues defined by difference spectra of protein variants carrying aromatic residues. Aromatic residues play an important role in determining the circular dichroism spectrum of proteins not only in the near-UV but also in the far-UV region.",

        "abstract": "The temperature and guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) dependence of the structural stability of diphtheria toxin has been investigated by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. In 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 8.0 and in the absence of GuHCl, the thermal unfolding of diphtheria toxin is characterized by a transition temperature (Tm) of 54.9 degrees C, a calorimetric enthalpy change (delta H) of 295 kcal/mol, and a van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpy ratio of 0.57. Increasing the GuHCl concentration lowers the transition temperature and the calorimetric enthalpy change. At the same time, the van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpy ratio increases until it reaches a value of 1 at 0.3 M GuHCl and remains constant thereafter. At low GuHCl concentrations (0-0.3 M), the thermal unfolding of diphtheria toxin is characterized by the presence of two transitions corresponding to the A and B domains of the protein. At higher GuHCl concentrations (0.3-1 M), the A domain is unfolded at all temperatures, and only one transition corresponding to the B domain is observed. Under these conditions, the most stable protein conformation at low temperatures is a partially folded state in which the A domain is unfolded and the B domain folded. A general model that explicitly considers the energetics of domain interactions has been developed in order to account for the stability and cooperative behavior of diphtheria toxin. It is shown that this cooperative domain interaction model correctly accounts for the temperature location as well as the shape and area of the calorimetric curves. Under physiological conditions, domain-domain interactions account for most of the structural stability of the A domain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The role of domains as folding units was investigated with a two-domain protein, yeast phosphoglycerate kinase. Each of the domains was produced independently by site-directed mutagenesis. It has been previously demonstrated by several criteria that these domains are able to fold in vivo into a quasi-native structure [Minard et al. (1989a) Protein Eng. 3, 55-60; Fairbrother et al. (1989) Protein Eng. 3, 5-11]. In the present study, the reversibility of the unfolding-refolding process induced by guanidine hydrochloride was investigated for the intact protein and the isolated domains. The transitions were followed by circular dichroism for both domains and the intact protein and by the variations in enzyme activity for the intact protein. Tryptophan residues were used as intrinsic conformational probes of the C-domain. An extrinsic fluorescent probe, N-[[(iodoacetyl)amino]ethyl]-8-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS), was bound to the unique cysteinyl residue Cys97 to observe the conformational events in the N-domain. The unfolding-refolding transitions of each domain in the intact protein and in the isolated domains prepared by site-directed mutagenesis were compared. It was shown that the two domains are able to refold in a fully reversible process. A hyperfluorescent intermediate was detected during the folding of both the isolated C-domain and the intact yeast phosphoglycerate kinase. The stability of each isolated domain was found to be similar, the free energy of unfolding being approximately half that of the intact molecule.",

        "abstract": "We report a comprehensive analysis of sequence features that allow for the production of autonomous human heavy chain variable (V(H)) domains that are stable and soluble in the absence of a light chain partner. Using combinatorial phage-displayed libraries and conventional biophysical methods, we analyzed the entire former light chain interface and the third complementarity determining region (CDR3). Unlike the monomeric variable domains of camelid heavy chain antibodies (V(H)H domains), in which autonomous behavior depends on interactions between the hydrophobic former light chain interface and CDR3, we find that the stability of many in vitro evolved V(H) domains is essentially independent of the CDR3 sequence and instead derives from mutations that increase the hydrophilicity of the former light chain interface by replacing exposed hydrophobic residues with structurally compatible hydrophilic substitutions. The engineered domains can be expressed recombinantly at high yield, are predominantly monomeric at high concentrations, unfold reversibly, and are even more thermostable than typical camelid V(H)H domains. Many of the stabilizing mutations are rare in natural V(H) and V(H)H domains and thus could not be predicted by studying natural sequences and structures. The results demonstrate that autonomous V(H) domains with structural properties beyond the scope of natural frameworks can be derived by using non-natural mutations, which differ from those found in camelid V(H)H domains. These findings should enable the development of libraries of synthetic V(H) domains with CDR3 diversities unconstrained by structural demands.",

        "abstract": "The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) folds into an active structure and then converts slowly to a more stable, but low-activity, \"latent\" conformation [Hekman, C. M., & Loskutoff, D. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11581-11587]. Thus, the folding of PAI-1 is apparently under kinetic control. We have determined the urea denaturation and refolding transitions of both latent and active PAI-1 proteins by using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. While folding of active PAI-1 is reversible, the denaturation and refolding of latent PAI-1 are not. Instead, denatured latent PAI-1 refolds in lower concentrations of urea to give the active protein. Thus, the high-stability latent conformation is kinetically inaccessible over a range of urea concentrations. Complete denaturation of latent PAI-1 occurs at 5.5 M urea [delta G(H2O) approximately 21 kcal] whereas active PAI-1 denatures in only 3.8 M urea [delta G(H2O) approximately 12 kcal]. The fluorescence emission profile, as a function of urea of both the active and latent forms of the protein, reveals intermediates with partial structure. Circular dichroism measurements and limited protease digestion with Lys-C suggest that the intermediate in the denaturation of latent PAI-1 retains most of the secondary structure of the fully folded protein, whereas the intermediate in the denaturation of active PAI-1 exhibits significant loss of secondary structure. The Lys-C digestion patterns show that the active protein is more susceptible to proteolysis near sheet A than is the latent form. The studies suggest a model for the kinetically controlled folding pathway of PAI-1.",

A corollary of this theory suggests that enzyme residues involved in function are not optimized for stability. We tested this hypothesis by mutating functionally important residues in the active site of T4 lysozyme. Six mutations at two catalytic residues, Glu-11 and Asp-20, abolished or reduced enzymatic activity but increased thermal stability by 0.7-1.7 kcal.mol-1. Nine mutations at two substrate-binding residues, Ser-117 and Asn-132, increased stability by 1.2-2.0 kcal.mol-1, again at the cost of reduced activity. X-ray crystal structures show that the substituted residues complement regions of the protein surface that are used for substrate recognition in the native enzyme. In two of these structures the enzyme undergoes a general conformational change, similar to that seen in an enzyme-product complex. These results support a relationship between stability and function for T4 lysozyme. Other evidence suggests that the relationship is general.",

        "abstract": "The role of electrostatic interactions in the stability and the folding of the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 (NTL9) was investigated by determining the effects of varying the pH conditions. Urea denaturations and thermal unfolding experiments were used to measure the free energy of folding, DeltaG degrees, at 18 different pH values, ranging from pH 1.1 to pH 10.5. Folding rates were measured at 19 pH values between pH 2.1 and pH 9.5, and unfolding rates were determined at 15 pH values in this range using stopped-flow fluorescence experiments. The protein is maximally stable between pH 5.5 and 7.5 with a value of DeltaG degrees =4.45 kcal mol(-1). The folding rate reaches a maximum at pH 5.5, however the change in folding rates with pH is relatively modest. Over the pH range of 2.1 to 5.5 there is a small increase in folding rates, ln (k(f)) changes from 5.1 to 6.8. However, the change in stability is more dramatic, with a difference of 2.6 kcal mol(-1) between pH 2.0 and pH 5.4. The change in stability is largely due to the smaller barrier for unfolding at low pH values. The natural log of the unfolding rates varies by approximately four units between pH 2.1 and pH 5.5. The stability of the protein decreases above pH 7.5 and again the change is largely due to changes in the unfolding rate. ln (k(f)) varies by less than one unit between pH 5.5 and pH 9.5 while DeltaG degrees decreases by 2.4 kcal mol(-1) over the range of pH 5. 4 to pH 10.0, which corresponds to a change in ln K(eq) of 4.0.

We have generated the series Val-->Ala-->Gly and Val<==>Thr at five positions, as well as the side-chain deletion Ile-->Val at residue 49 and Ala-->Gly at residue 77. In the series Val-->Ala-->Gly, the ranking order in terms of stability is Val > Ala > Gly at all positions. However, the change in free energy on deletion of methylene groups varies greatly. When Val and Thr are interchanged, the wild-type residue is always the more stable, but by a different amount at each position. We have attempted to rationalize the data by relating it to changes in solvent-accessible surface area, packing density, and statistically derived pseudo-energy functions that depend on phi, psi angles. There is no significant correlation of the energies with any of the variables except with the pseudo-energy function, but the deviations from these values are large. We conclude that thermodynamic scales for beta-sheet propensity are currently of insufficient precision for general design purposes, although they may be useful in special cases.",

Stability parameters characterizing the guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curves were also calculated on the basis of a two-state transition. The transitions of the wild-type occurs at 0.82 M GdnHCl and that of the c71s mutant at 0.55 M GdnHCl. These differences in the half denaturation concentration of GdnHCl reflect already the significant stability differences between the two proteins. A quantitative measure are the Gibbs energies DeltaG(0)(D)(buffer) at 25 degrees C of 15.5 kJ/mol for the wild-type and 8.0 kJ/mol for the mutant. We characterized also the alkyl chain binding properties of the two proteins by measuring the interaction parameters for the complex formation with 1-O-Decanyl-beta-D-glucoside using isothermal titration microcalorimetry. The dissociation constants, K(d), for wild-type SCP2 are 335 microM at 25 degrees C and 1.3 mM at 35 degrees C.

The parameters for the c71s mutant at 25 degrees C are K(d)=413 microM and DeltaH(b)=16.6 kJ/mol.

In the pH range of 5-9, there is an average increase in T(m) values of P48A and P48S of 0.4 degrees C and 0.2 degrees C, respectively, relative to the wild-type protein. The other mutants are less stable than the wild type. Analysis of the effects of such Pro substitutions in MBP and in three other proteins studied to date suggests that substitutions are more likely to be stabilizing if the carbonyl group i-3 or i-4 to the mutation site is not hydrogen bonded in the wild-type protein.",

        "abstract": "The crystal structure of the staphylococcal nuclease mutant V66K, in which valine 66 is replaced by lysine, has been solved at 1.97 A resolution. Unlike lysine residues in previously reported protein structures, this residue appears to bury its side-chain in the hydrophobic core without salt bridging, hydrogen bonding or other forms of electrostatic stabilization. Solution studies of the free energy of denaturation, delta GH2O, show marked pH dependence and clearly indicate that the lysine residue must be deprotonated in the folded state. V66K is highly unstable at neutral pH but only modestly less stable than the wild-type protein at high pH. The pH dependence of stability for V66K, in combination with similar measurements for the wild-type protein, allowed determination of the pKa values of the lysine in both the denatured and native forms. The epsilon-amine of this residue has a pKa value in the denatured state of 10.2, but in the native state it must be 6.4 or lower. The epsilon-amine is thus deprotonated in the folded molecule. These values enabled an estimation of the epsilon-amine's relative change in free energy of solvation between solvent and the protein interior at 5.1 kcal/mol or greater. This implies that the value of the dielectric constant of the protein interior must be less than 12.8. Lysine is usually found with the methylene groups of its side-chain partly buried but is nevertheless considered a hydrophilic surface residue. It would appear that the high pKa value of lysine, which gives it a positive charge at physiological pH, is the primary reason for its almost exclusive confinement to the surface proteins. When deprotonated, this amino acid type can be fully incorporated into the hydrophobic core.",

        "abstract": "Cold denaturation of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (yPGK) was investigated by a combination of far UV circular dichroism (CD), steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, and small angle X-ray scattering. It was shown that cold denaturation of yPGK cannot be accounted for by a simple two-state process and that an intermediate state can be stabilized under mild denaturing conditions. Comparison between far UV CD and fluorescence shows that in this state the protein displays a fluorescence signal corresponding mainly to exposed tryptophans, whereas its CD signal is only partially modified. Comparison with spectroscopic data obtained from a mutant missing the last 12 amino-acids (yPGK delta404) suggests that lowering the temperature mainly results in a destabilization of hydrophobic interactions between the two domains. Small angle X-ray scattering measurements give further information about this stabilized intermediate. At 4 degrees C and in the presence of 0.45 M Gdn-HCl, the main species corresponds to a protein as compact as native yPGK, whereas a significant proportion of ellipticity has been lost. Although various techniques have shown the existence of residual structures in denatured proteins, this is one example of a compact denatured state devoid of its main content in alpha helices.",

        "abstract": "Overexpression of cloned genes in bacteria often leads to insoluble refractile body formation requiring solubilization and refolding to obtain biologically active proteins. A refolding pathway was established for a model protein, porcine growth hormone (PGH), yielding an appreciably high recovery of 85%. The conditions include the dilution of a urea, beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME) denatured PGH solution in a refolding environment containing 3.5 M urea and 10 mM beta-ME/HED at a 10:1 ratio at pH 9.1 and 0.5 mg/mL PGH. The intrinsic fluorescence-detected transition of PGH in urea gives 3.8 kcal/mol for the free energy of denaturation (delta GH2O) of PGH. The native-like conformation of PGH is dependent on disulfide bonds because reduced and carboxymethylated PGH is devoid of tertiary structure as assessed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Physical analysis of C-terminally truncated recombinant PGH indicated no significant difference in the free energy of denaturation of P-band in urea as full-length PGH. This suggests that the first disulfide, forming the large loop domain of PGH, provides a significantly greater contribution to the conformational stability of PGH than the second disulfide, which forms the carboxy-terminal small loop domain. The rate of formation of native structure during refolding was biphasic, with native structure identified by intrinsic fluorescence and hydrophobicity spectroscopy prior to disulfide bond formation. Thus \"framework\" intermediates are prerequisites for correct disulfide formation and tertiary folding of PGH. This study shows how a protein refolds, forms disulfides, and self-associates, which may be useful for examining the refolding of other recombinant proteins.",

        "abstract": "DsbA, a 21-kDa protein from Escherichia coli, is a potent oxidizing disulfide catalyst required for disulfide bond formation in secreted proteins. The active site of DsbA is similar to that of mammalian protein disulfide isomerases, and includes a reversible disulfide bond formed from cysteines separated by two residues (Cys30-Pro31-His32-Cys33). Unlike most protein disulfides, the active-site disulfide of DsbA is highly reactive and the oxidized form of DsbA is much less stable than the reduced form at physiological pH. His32, one of the two residues between the active-site cysteines, is critical to the oxidizing power of DsbA and to the relative instability of the protein in the oxidized form. Mutation of this single residue to tyrosine, serine, or leucine results in a significant increase in stability (of approximately 5-7 kcal/mol) of the oxidized His32 variants relative to the oxidized wild-type protein. Despite the dramatic changes in stability, the structures of all three oxidized DsbA His32 variants are very similar to the wild-type oxidized structure, including conservation of solvent atoms near the active-site residue, Cys30. These results show that the His32 residue does not exert a conformational effect on the structure of DsbA. The destabilizing effect of His32 on oxidized DsbA is therefore most likely electrostatic in nature.",

        "abstract": "Lys-234 has been postulated to participate in beta-lactamase catalysis by acting as an electrostatic anchor for the C3 carboxylate of penicillins [Herzberg, O., & Moult, J. (1987) Science 236, 694-701]. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the Lys-234 in Bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase into Glu-234 or Ala-234. The wild-type, Glu-234, and Ala-234 beta-lactamases have been expressed in Bacillus subtilis and purified to homogeneity. The wild-type, K234E, and K234A enzymes have virtually identical circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra, similar thermal stabilities at neutral pH, and the same susceptibilities to proteolysis, indicating the lack of significant structural perturbation caused by the mutation. At acidic and basic pH the mutant enzymes have the same native circular dichroism as the wild-type enzyme but the thermal stability is significantly different. The mutations cause perturbations of the pK values of the ionizing groups responsible for the pH dependence of the catalytic reaction in both the free enzyme and the E.S complex. As expected, conversion of Lys-234 to Ala or Glu decreased substrate binding (Km) by 1-2 orders of magnitude for several penicillin and cephalosporin substrates at neutral and higher pH. However, at low pH, Km is essentially the same for the K234E and K234A enzymes as for the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, decreases of 2-3 orders of magnitude in kcat were also observed, indicating substantial effects on the transition-state binding, as well as on ground-state binding. Surprisingly, changing the C3 carboxylate of phenoxymethylpenicillin to a hydroxymethyl group led to little difference in kinetic properties with the K234E or K234A enzyme. The results of this investigation indicate the Lys-234 is an important active-site residue involved in both ground-state and transition-state binding.",

However, notwithstanding these similarities between the sequences of the cytochromes c-552 and c-551 that were compared, it is very likely that these differences in stability could be due to some heretofore undefined differences in their spatial structures.

The site binding enthalpies, DeltaHb, with the exception of Me-alpha-DNS-GalN, are the same at both temperatures and range from -47.1 +/- 1.0 kJ mol-1 for N-acetyllactosamine to -4.4 +/- 0.3 kJ mol-1 for fucose, and the site binding constants range from 3.82 +/- 0.9 x 10(5)M-1 for Me-alpha-DNS-GalN at 283.2 K to 0.46 +/- 0.05 x 10(3) M-1 for fucose at 297.2 K. The binding reactions are mainly enthalpically driven except for fucose and exhibit enthalpy-entropy compensation. The binding enthalpies of the disaccharides are about twice the binding enthalpies of the monosaccharides in contrast to concanavalin A where the binding enthalpies do not double for the disaccharides. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements show that denaturation of the ECorL dimer results in dissociation into its monomer subunits. The binding constants from the increase in denaturation temperature of ECorL in the presence of saccharides are in agreement with values from isothermal titration calorimetry results. The thermal denaturation of ECorL occurs around 333 K, well below the 344-360 K denaturation temperature of other legume lectins of similar size and tertiary structure, undoubtedly due to the difference in its quaternary structure relative to other legume lectins.

        "abstract": "CheY, the 129 amino acid chemotactic protein from Escherichia coli, is a good model for studies of folding of parallel alpha/beta proteins. We report here the thermodynamic characterization of the wild-type CheY at different pH values and in different buffers and denaturation conditions. The denaturation of CheY by urea monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence fits the two-state unfolding model. The stability of the protein is ionic strength dependent, probably due to the presence of three Asp residues in very close proximity in its active site. The presence of a Mg2+ ion, which seems to interact with Asp 13 in the active site, stabilizes the native structure by up to 6.9 kJ mol-1. The CheY maximum stability (31.7 +/- 2.1 kJ mol-1), without magnesium, is reached at pH 5.1. Analysis of scanning calorimetry data has shown that temperature-induced unfolding of CheY is not a two-state process and proceeds through a highly populated intermediate state, corresponding to protein dimers, as was subsequently confirmed by direct cross-linking experiments. According to circular dichroism, fluorescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ANS binding experiments, this \"intermediate dimer\" at pH 2.5 exhibits all known characteristics of the \"molten globule\" state. The reversible dimerization of \"molten globules\" might explain such peculiarities as the increased stability or the cooperative unfolding found for the molten globule state of some proteins.",

We examined the bacterial expression characteristics and stability of this library using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter screen, SDS-PAGE analysis, and chemical denaturation, respectively. The high throughput GFP reporter screen demonstrates that a large fraction of our library expresses significant levels of soluble protein in bacteria. However, SDS-PAGE analysis of expression cultures indicates the ratio of soluble to insoluble protein expressed varies greatly for randomly chosen library members. We also tested the stabilities of several representative variants by guanidinium chloride denaturation. All variants tested displayed cooperative unfolding transitions similar to wild-type, and two exhibited free energies of unfolding equal to wild-type 10FnIII. This work demonstrates the utility of GFP-based screening as a tool for analysis of high-complexity protein libraries.

        "abstract": "The refolding of ribonuclease T1 involves two major slow processes that exhibit properties of prolyl isomerization reactions. A comparison of the wild-type protein and a designed variant where the cis Ser54-Pro55 bond was replaced by a Gly54-Asn55 bond indicated that the faster of these reactions is the isomerization of Pro55. Here we report the replacement of the other cis proline of ribonuclease T1 at position 39 by alanine. The Pro39Ala variant is similar to the wild-type protein in secondary and tertiary structure, and the enzymatic activity towards RNA and a dinucleotide substrate remains almost unchanged. The fluorescence emission of the single Trp59 is lowered by the Pro39Ala substitution, probably because Trp59 is in close contact to Pro39 in wild-type ribonuclease T1. Unlike the substitution of cis Pro55, the Pro39Ala mutation is strongly destabilizing and reduces the Gibbs free energy of the folded protein by about 20 kJ/mol. Pro39 is buried in native RNase T1 and located near the active site. The observed destabilization could originate from the presence of a cis alanyl bond in the Pro39Ala variant or from a local distortion caused by the incorporation of a trans alanyl peptide bond in the interior of the protein. In the refolding kinetics the replacement of Pro39 leads to a disappearance of the fast-refolding species. Refolding still involves two consecutive slow steps. The first and faster step could be the isomerization of the remaining cis Pro55. The second, very slow step is a novel reaction that appears to have no counterpart in the refolding of the wild-type protein. All mutant molecules must undergo this reaction before reaching the native state. These major changes in the folding kinetics strongly indicate that cis-Pro39 is indeed of major importance for the folding of the wild-type protein. They indicate, moreover, that some new feature of protein folding kinetics is observed in these studies of the Pro39Ala variant.",

S38 Xyl1 and thermophilic Thermomonospora fusca TfxA family 11 xylanases were built and compared with the three-dimensional (3D) structures of homologous enzymes. Some of the structural features identified as potential contributors to the higher thermostability of TfxA were introduced in Xyl1 by site-directed mutagenesis in an attempt to improve its thermostability and thermophilicity. A new Y11-Y16 aromatic interaction, similar to that present in TfxA and created in Xyl1 by the T11Y mutation, improved both the thermophilicity and thermostability. Indeed, the optimum activity temperature (70 vs. 60 degrees C) and the apparent Tm were increased by about 9 degrees C, and the mutant was sixfold more stable at 57 degrees C. The combined mutations A82R/F168H/N169D/delta170 potentially creating a R82-D169 salt bridge homologous to that present in TfxA improved the thermostability but not the thermophilicity. Mutations R82/D170 and S33P seemed to be slightly destabilizing and devoid of influence on the optimal activity temperature of Xyl1. Structural analysis revealed that residues Y11 and Y16 were located on beta-strands B1 and B2, respectively. This interaction should increase the stability of the N-terminal part of Xyl1. Moreover, Y11 and Y16 seem to form an aromatic continuum with five other residues forming putative subsites involved in the binding of xylan (+3, +2, +1, -1, -2). Y11 and Y16 might represent two additional binding subsites (-3, -4) and the T11Y mutation could thus improve substrate binding to the enzyme at higher temperature and thus the thermophilicity of Xyl1.",

        "abstract": "We recently reported stretched kinetics during the formation of a collapsed, long-lived intermediate state of the large two-domain enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). It was postulated that intrinsic roughness of the energy landscape on the way downhill to the intermediate causes the lack of a single time-scale. Here, we investigate several alternative explanations for stretched refolding dynamics in more detail: tyrosine fluorescence, multiple tryptophan probes, and rate differences between independently folding domains. To this end, we systematically simplify PGK in several steps from the full protein with two tryptophan residues and all tyrosine residues probed, to a single domain with only one tryptophan residue and no tyrosine residue probed. The kinetics in the 10 micros to 10 ms range are revealed by laser-induced temperature-jump relaxation experiments. The isolated N-terminal domain forms an intermediate by nearly single-exponential kinetics, but the isolated C-terminal domain shows strongly non-exponential kinetics. Thus, domain interaction and a cis-proline residue between the two domains are ruled out as the sole contributors to heterogeneity during the earliest folding dynamics of the C-terminal domain. We apply two limiting models for the roughness of the energy landscape. A sequential three-state model lumps all the roughness into a single trap. The \"strange kinetics\" model with logarithmic oscillations developed by Klafter and co-workers distributes the roughness over a larger number of states. Both models explain our data about equally well, but the coincidental values of rate constants in all of our double-exponential fits, and the absence of a spectroscopic signature distinct from the endpoints of the folding process favors more roughness than can be explained by just a single trap.",

The choice of mutants and conditions provided in-built controls for artifacts that might distort the interpretation of kinetics, such as the non-linearity of kinetic and equilibrium data with concentration of denaturant. We measured unfolding rate constants over a complete range of denaturant concentration by using by 1H/2H-exchange kinetics under conditions that favour folding, conventional stopped-flow methods at higher denaturant concentrations and continuous flow. Under conditions that favour multi-state kinetics, plots of the rate constants for unfolding against denaturant concentration fitted quantitatively to the equation for three-state kinetics, with a sigmoid component for a change of rate determining step, as did the refolding kinetics. The position of the transition state on the reaction pathway, as measured by solvent exposure (the Tanford beta value) also moved with denaturant concentration, fitting quantitatively to the same equations with a change of rate determining step. The sigmoid behaviour disappeared under conditions that favoured two-state kinetics. Those data combined with direct structural observations and simulation support a minimal reaction pathway for the folding of barnase that involves two detectable folding intermediates. The first intermediate, I(1), is the denatured state under physiological conditions, D(Phys), which has native-like topology, is lower in energy than the random-flight denatured state U and is suggested by molecular dynamics simulation of unfolding to be on-pathway. The second intermediate, I(2), is high energy, and is proven by the change in rate determining step in the unfolding kinetics to be on-pathway. The change in rate determining step in unfolding with structure or environment reflects the change in partitioning of this intermediate to products or starting materials.",

Two nonconservative mutations at W74 of r-[K2tPA] have been constructed, expressed, and purified, resulting in one variant molecule containing a W74L mutation (r-[K2tPA/W74L]) and another containing a W74S mutation (r-[K2tPA/W74S]). In both cases, binding of EACA and 7-AHpA was virtually eliminated in the mutated kringles. Two additional conservative mutations at W74 of r-[K2tPA] have been similarly generated, resulting in r-[K2tPA/W74F] and r-[K2tPA/W74Y]. For these mutants, binding of the same ligands to the variant recombinant kringle domain is retained, although it is significantly weaker in nature. The 1H-NMR spectra of each of the variant kringles demonstrates that all retain the general gross conformations of their wild-type counterpart but that some environmental changes of proton resonances occur at particular aromatic amino acid residues that may be involved in omega-amino acid binding. Differential scanning calorimetric analyses of each of the variant kringles suggest that none of the mutations led to substantial destabilization of their structures, again suggestive of gross conformational similarities in all r-[K2tPA] molecules constructed. We conclude that the aromatic character present at position 74 of wild-type r-[K2tPA] is of great importance to its ability to interact with omega-amino acid ligands, with tryptophan being the most effective amino acid at that position.",

The urea-induced unfolding of GOD was a two-state process with dissociation and unfolding of the native dimeric enzyme molecule occurring in a single step. On the contrary, the GdmCl-induced unfolding of GOD was a multiphasic process with stabilization of a conformation more compact than the native enzyme at low GdmCl concentrations and dissociation along with unfolding of enzyme at higher concentrations of GdmCl. The GdmCl-stabilized compact dimeric intermediate of GOD showed an enhanced stability against thermal and urea denaturation as compared to the native GOD dimer. Comparative studies on GOD using GdmCl and NaCl demonstrated that binding of the Gdm(+) cation to the enzyme results in stabilization of the compact dimeric intermediate of the enzyme at low GdmCl concentrations. An interesting observation was that a slight difference in the concentration of urea and GdmCl associated with the unfolding of GOD was observed, which is in violation of the 2-fold rule for urea and GdmCl denaturation of proteins. This is the first report where violation of the 2-fold rule has been observed for a multimeric protein.",

        "abstract": "The folding of membrane proteins was addressed using outer membrane protein porin from the soil bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans (P. den.). IR spectroscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis were used to probe the effect of mutagenesis on the thermal stability of the protein. Secondary structure analysis by amide I ir spectroscopy showed that the wild-type protein was predominantly composed of beta-sheet, which supports the x-ray crystal structure information (A. Hirsch, J. Breed, K. Saxena, O.-M. H. Richter, B. Ludwig, K. Diederichs, and W. Welte, FEBS Letters, 1997, Vol. 404, pp. 208-210). The mutants E81Q, W74C, and E81Q/D148N were shown to have similar secondary structure composition as the wild type. Wild-type protein and the mutants in detergent micelles underwent irreversible denaturation as a result of heating. Transition temperature calculated from the amide I analysis revealed that mutant porins were slightly less stable compared to the wild type. The protein in micelles showed complete monomerization of the trimer above 85 degrees C. In native-like conditions (provided by liposomes), no change was observed in the secondary structure of the protein until 95 degrees C. This is supported by SDS-PAGE as no change in quaternary structure was observed, proving that the proteins are structurally thermostable in liposomes as compared to micelles. Our studies demonstrated that porins resistant to detergents and proteases are highly thermostable as well.",

        "abstract": "The propensity for peptide bonds to adopt the trans configuration in native and unfolded proteins, and the relatively slow rates of cis-trans isomerization reactions, imply that the formation of cis peptide bonds in native conformations are likely to limit folding reactions. The role of the conserved cis Gly95-Gly96 peptide bond in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherichia coli was examined by replacing Gly95 with alanine. The introduction of a beta carbon at position 95 is expected to increase the propensity for the trans isomer and perturb the isomerization reaction required to reach the native conformation. Although G95A DHFR is 1.30 kcal mol(-1) less stable than the wild-type protein, it adopts a well-folded structure that can be chemically denatured in a cooperative fashion. The mutant protein also retains the complex refolding kinetic pattern attributed to a parallel-channel mechanism in wild-type DHFR. The spectroscopic response upon refolding monitored by Trp fluorescence and the absence of a Trp/Trp exciton coupling apparent in the far-UV CD spectrum of the wild-type protein, however, indicated that the tertiary structure of the folded state for G95A DHFR is altered. The addition of methotrexate (MTX), a tight-binding inhibitor, to folded G95A DHFR restored the exciton coupling and the fluorescence properties through five slow kinetic events whose relaxation times are independent of the ligand and the denaturant concentrations. The results were interpreted to mean that MTX-binding drives the formation of the cis isomer of the peptide bond between Ala95 and Gly96 in five compact and stable but not wild-type-like conformations that contain the trans isomer. Folding studies in the presence of MTX for both wild-type and G95A DHFR support the notion that the cis peptide bond between Gly95 and Gly96 in the wild-type protein forms during four parallel rate-limiting steps, which are primarily controlled by folding reactions, and lead directly to a set of native, or native-like, conformers. The isomerization of the cis peptide bond is not a source of the parallel channels that characterize the complex folding mechanism for DHFR.",

We compared their thermostability also with the mesophilic counterpart, CDA(Bsubt), isolated from Bacillus subtilis (growth at 37 degrees C). The DNA fragments encoding CDA(Bcald) and CDA(Bpsy) were sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequences showed 70% identity. High sequence similarity was also found with the mesophilic CDA(Bsubt). Both enzymes were found to be homotetramers of approximately 58 kDa. CDA(Bcald) was found to be highly thermostable, as expected, up to 65 degrees C, whereas CDA(Bpsy) showed higher specific activity at lower temperatures and was considerably less thermostable than CDA(Bcald). After partial denaturation at 72 degrees C for 30 min, followed by renaturation on ice, CDA(Bcald) recovered 100% of its enzymatic activity, whereas CDA(Bpsy) as well as CDA(Bsubt) were irreversibly inactivated. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of CDA(Bcald) and CDA(Bpsy) at temperatures ranging from 10 to 95 degrees C showed a markedly different thermostability of their secondary structures: at 10 and 25 degrees C the CD spectra were indistinguishable, suggesting a similar overall structure, but as temperature increases up to 50-70 degrees C, the alpha-helices of CDA(Bpsy) unfolded almost completely, whereas its beta-structure and the aromatic amino acids core remained pretty stable. No significant differences were seen in the secondary structures of CDA(Bcald) with increase in temperature.",

        "abstract": "The dinuclear copper center (TtCuA) forming the electron entry site in the subunit II of the cytochrome c oxidase in Thermus thermophilus shows high stability toward thermal as well as denaturant-induced unfolding of the protein at ambient pH. We have studied the effect of pH on the stability of the holo-protein as well as of the apo-protein by UV-visible absorption, far-UV, and visible circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results show that the holo-protein both in the native mixed-valence state as well as in the reduced state of the metal ions and the apo-protein of TtCuA were extremely stable toward unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride at ambient pH. The thermal unfolding studies at different values of pH suggested that decreasing pH had almost no effect on the thermal stability of the protein in the absence of the denaturant. However, the stability of the proteins in presence of the denaturant was considerably decreased on lowering the pH. Moreover, the stability of the holo-protein in the reduced state of the metal ion was found to be lower than that in the mixed-valence state at the same pH. The denaturant-induced unfolding of the protein at different values of pH was analyzed using a two-state unfolding model. The values of the free energy of unfolding were found to increase with pH. The holo-protein showed that the variation of the unfolding free energy was associated with a pKa of approximately 5.5. This is consistent with the model that the protonation of a histidine residue may be responsible for the decrease in the stability of the holo-protein at low pH. The results were interpreted in the light of the reported crystal structure of the protein.",

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of bacteriorhodopsin in the purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-dependent spectroscopy in the pH range from 5 to 11. Monitoring of protein fluorescence and absorbance in the near-UV and visible regions indicates that changes primarily occur in tertiary structure with denaturation. Far-UV circular dichroism shows only small changes in the secondary structure, unlike most globular water-soluble proteins of comparable molecular weight. The DSC transition can best be described as a two-state denaturation of the trimer. Thermodynamic analysis of the calorimetric transition reveals some similarity between the unfolding of bacteriorhodopsin and water-soluble proteins. Specifically, a pH dependence of the midpoint temperature of denaturation is seen as well as a temperature-dependent enthalpy of denaturation. Proteolysis experiments on denatured purple membrane suggest that bacteriorhodopsin may be partially extruded from the membrane as it denatures. Exposure of buried hydrophobic residues to the aqueous environment upon denaturation is consistent with the observed temperature-dependent enthalpy.",

Several mutant proteins with m- characteristics of guanidinium chloride denaturation were found to denature via a three-state mechanism with increasing temperature. Enthalpy changes for the transitions from the native to intermediate and from the intermediate to denatured states were determined. In the case of the triple mutant, the enthalpy of the second endothermic transition is greater than that of the first. Observation of this second transition provides an explanation for the previously reported large changes in the delta H denaturation for the triple mutant versus wild-type nuclease. The sequence specificity of structure in the intermediate state is discussed with relevance to m values of guanidinium chloride denaturation. The enthalpic level of the intermediate state depends upon the amino acid sequence, suggesting that stabilizing mutations can increase the extent or cohesion of structure present in the intermediate.",

        "abstract": "In order to gain greater insight into the effects of beta-branched amino acids on protein alpha-helices, hydrophobic amino acids with varying degrees of beta-branching, including the fully beta-substituted L-2-amino-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid (ADBA), were incorporated into the protein T4 lysozyme. The unnatural and natural amino acids were substituted at two solvent-exposed alpha-helical sites, Ser 44 and Asn 68, in the protein using the technique of unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. The stabilities of the mutant proteins were determined by using a heat of inactivation assay and from their circular dichroism thermal denaturation curves. Surprisingly, while substitution of the amino acid with the greatest degree of beta-branching, ADBA, destabilizes the protein by 2.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C (0.69 +/- 0.03 kcal/mol) relative to Ala at site 44, the same substitution stabilizes the protein by 1.0 +/- 0.1 degree C (0.27 +/- 0.03 kcal/mol) at site 68. The difference observed at these two positions illustrates the extent to which the local context can mediate the impact of a particular mutation. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in parallel to model the structures of the mutant proteins and to examine the energetic consequences of incorporating ADBA. Together, these results suggest that the conformationally restricted beta-branched amino acids are destabilizing, in part, because the beta-branched methyl groups can cause distortions in the local helix backbone. In addition, it is proposed that in some contexts the conformational rigidity of beta-branched amino acids may be stabilizing because it lowers the entropic cost of forming favorable side-chain van der Waals interactions.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disorder characterized by the death of both upper and lower motor neurons and by 3- to 5-yr median survival postdiagnosis. The only US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of ALS, Riluzole, has at best, moderate effect on patient survival and quality of life; therefore innovative approaches are needed to combat neurodegenerative disease. Some familial forms of ALS (fALS) have been linked to mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). The dominant inheritance of mutant SOD1 and lack of symptoms in knockout mice suggest a \"gain of toxic function\" as opposed to a loss of function. A prevailing hypothesis for the mechanism of the toxicity of fALS-SOD1 variants, or the gain of toxic function, involves dimer destabilization and dissociation as an early step in SOD1 aggregation. Therefore, stabilizing the SOD1 dimer, thus preventing aggregation, is a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we report a strategy in which we chemically cross-link the SOD1 dimer using two adjacent cysteine residues on each respective monomer (Cys111). Stabilization, measured as an increase in melting temperature, of \u223c20 \u00b0C and \u223c45 \u00b0C was observed for two mutants, G93A and G85R, respectively. This stabilization is the largest for SOD1, and to the best of our knowledge, for any disease-related protein. In addition, chemical cross-linking conferred activity upon G85R, an otherwise inactive mutant. These results demonstrate that targeting these cysteine residues is an important new strategy for development of ALS therapies.",

Here we demonstrate that, in the absence of ligand, in vitro LUSH exists in a partial molten globule state. The presence of short-chain n-alcohols at pharmacologically relevant concentrations less than 50 mM shifts the conformational equilibrium to a more compact state that exhibits reduced binding of the fluorescent dye 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid. Equilibrium unfolding studies of LUSH-alcohol complexes reveal that, for a series of short-chain n-alcohols, each methylene group can contribute approximately 1 K cal mol(-1) to the overall stability of the protein-alcohol complex. Using NMR spectroscopy, we have identified the regions of LUSH that show increased conformational stability on binding alcohols. These residues primarily line the alcohol-binding pocket. The results presented here provide a direct measure of the degree of stability that alcohol imparts on LUSH. These observations may represent a model for how ethanol can stabilize alternative protein conformations in alcohol-sensitive human proteins and ultimately lead to the observed changes in higher order function throughout the central nervous system.",

In this study, the mechanism by which the central domain moves between the two catalytic sites located on the N-terminal and C-terminal domains was probed by expressing this domain as an independent protein and measuring its structure, stability, and ability to catalyze the ATP/phosphate partial reaction in conjunction with the engineered N-terminal domain protein (residues 1-340 of the native PPDK). The encoding gene was engineered to express the central domain as residues 381-512 of the native PPDK. The central domain was purified and shown to be soluble, monomeric (13,438 Da), and stable (deltaG = 4.3 kcal/mol for unfolding in buffer at pH 7.0, 25 degrees C) and to possess native structure, as determined by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR analysis. The main chain structure of the central domain in solution aligns closely with that of the X-ray structure of native PPDK (the root-mean-square deviation is 2.2 A). Single turnover reactions of [14C]ATP and phosphate, carried out in the presence of equal concentrations of central domain and the N-terminal domain protein, did not produce the expected products, in contrast to efficient product formation observed for the N-terminal central domain construct (residues 1-553 of the native PPDK). These results are interpreted as evidence that the central domain, although solvent-compatible, must be tethered by the flexible linkers to the N-terminal domain for the productive domain-domain docking required for efficient catalysis.",

        "abstract": "This study elucidates the importance of thermal reversibility as it pertains to the minimization of recombinant human Flt3 ligand aggregation and its potential role for determining solution conditions that can achieve the greatest long-term storage stability. Both thermal reversibility and Tm were evaluated as microcalorimetric parameters of stability within the range extending from pH 6 to 9, where the Tm was shown to plateau near 80 degrees C. Within this region, the reversibility was shown to decrease from 96. 6% to 15.2% while the pH was increased from 6 to 9, respectively. Accelerated stability studies conducted at 50 degrees C exhibited rates of aggregation augmented by pH that inversely correlated with the thermal reversibility data. Namely, high thermal reversibility at the Tm plateau correlated with slower rates of aggregation. Enthalpic calorimetric to van't Hoff ratios (DeltaH1/DeltaHv) yielded results close to unity within the plateau region, suggesting that the unfolding of rhFlt3 ligand was approximately two-state. Evidence that unfolding preceded the formation of the aggregate was provided by far-UV CD data of a soluble islolate of the aggregated product exhibiting a 28% loss of alpha-helix offset by a 31% gain in beta-sheet. This information combined with the thermal reversibility data provided compelling evidence that unfolding was a key event in the aggregation pathway at 50 degrees C. Minimization of aggregation was achieved at pH 6 and corroborated by evidence acquired from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion data. Correspondingly, the bioactivity was found to be optimal at pH 6. The findings link thermal reversibility to the propensity of Flt3 ligand to aggregate once unfolded in the Tm plateau region and provide a basis for relating the reversibility of thermal denaturation to the prediction of long-term storage stability in aqueous solution.",

        "title": "Is the continuity of the domains required for the correct folding of a two-domain protein?", 
        "abstract": "The role of domains in protein folding has been widely studied and discussed. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether the continuity of the domains in a protein is an essential requirement in determining the folding pathway. Previous studies have shown that the isolated structural domains of the two-domain monomeric enzyme, yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (yPGK), are able to fold independently into a quasinative structure, but they neither reassociate nor generate a functional enzyme [Minard, P., Hall, L., Betton, J. M., Missiakas, D., & Yon, J. M. (1989) Protein Eng. 3, 55-60; Fairbrother, W. J., Bowen, D., Hall, L., Williams, R. J. P. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 184, 617-625; Missiakas, D., Betton, J. M., Minard, P., & Yon, J. M. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8683-8689]. In the present work, two circularly permuted variants of the yPGK gene were constructed. The natural adjacent chain termini were directly connected and the new extremities were created within the N-domain (at residues 71 and 72) or the C-domain (at residues 291 and 292), respectively. These two proteins were overexpressed and purified. They exhibit 14% and 23% of the wild-type enzyme activity, respectively. The two mutants fold in a compact conformation with slight changes in the secondary and tertiary structure probably related to the presence of a heterogeneous population of molecules. The unfolding studies reveal a large decrease in stability. From the present data it appears that, although the circular permutations induce some perturbations in the structure and stability of the protein, the continuity of the domains is not required for the protein to reach a native-like and functional structure.",

        "abstract": "A characteristic property of the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex is the mutual activation of the alpha and beta subunit upon complex formation. It has been speculated that this mutual activation results from the conformational change due to the alpha/beta subunit interaction. To elucidate this mechanism, we investigated the thermodynamic parameters of association for the various combinations of the alpha and beta subunits from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium using isothermal titration calorimetry. The negative association enthalpy of the S. typhimurium alpha subunit with the beta subunit from E. coli (or S. typhimurium) was about 20 kJ mol-1 larger than that of the E. coli alpha subunit at 40 degrees C. However, the favorable enthalpy of the S. typhimurium alpha subunit was perfectly compensated by the unfavorable association entropy, therefore, the Gibbs energy of association was similar to that of the E. coli alpha subunit. Furthermore, the site-directed mutagenesis study revealed that a single mutation (K109N; [Asn109] alpha subunit) of the E coli alpha subunit at the subunit interface from E. coli to the S. typhimurium type could change the characteristics of the thermodynamic parameters of association to the S. typhimurium alpha subunit type. The heat-capacity changes of the association of the alpha subunit with the beta subunit were quite great, 6.37-8.21 kJ mol-1 K-1, compared with that due to a decrease in accessible surface area in the subunit interface. The analysis of the thermodynamic parameters of association suggested that the complex formation couples with the folding (rearrangements) of the alpha subunit monomer or/and beta subunit dimer.",

        "abstract": "The role of intersubunit side chain-side chain interactions in the stability of the Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (eAATase) homodimer was investigated by directed mutagenesis at 10 different interface contacts. The urea-mediated unfolding pathway of this enzyme proceeds through the formation of a dimeric intermediate, D*, that retains only 40% of the native enzyme secondary structure as judged by circular dichroism. Disruption of any single intersubunit interaction results in a >2.6 kcal mol(-1) decrease in native state stability, independent of its location or nature. However, the stability of D* with respect to U, the unfolded monomer, is the same for all mutants. The stability of the eAATase interface cannot be ascribed to the contribution of a few hot spots, or to the accumulation of a large number of weak interactions, but only to the presence of multiple important and interconnected interactions. It is proposed that a \"molten interface\" structure, flexible enough to accommodate point mutations, accounts for the stability of D*. Nuclei of tertiary structure, which are not involved in native intersubunit contacts, likely provide a scaffold for the unstructured interface of D*. Such a scaffold would account for the cooperative unfolding of the intermediate.",

        "title": "Rupture of the hydrogen bond linking two Omega-loops induces the molten globule state at neutral pH in cytochrome c.", 
        "abstract": "His26Tyr and His33Tyr mutants were obtained from the Cys102Thr variant of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c. Spectroscopic studies show that a mutation at position 26 at pH 7.0 enhances flexibility of the peptide, alters the heme pocket region and the axial coordination to heme-iron, and reduces protein stability. The His26Tyr mutant shows properties typical of the molten globule. Further, formation of an axially misligated minor low spin species occurs with partial displacement of Met80, the axial ligand of the heme-iron in the native protein. The pK(a) determined for the alkaline transition of this mutant is 7.48 (+/- 0.05), approximately 0.5 lower than that of the wild-type protein. Hence, the alkaline conformer is populated at pH 7.0, and the sixth ligand of the misligated species is proposed to be a lysine. Furthermore, a reduction in catalytic activity indicates that the functional properties are altered. The results suggest that the structural and functional changes observed in the His26Tyr mutant are because the mutation frees the two Omega-loops that, in the native protein, are linked by the hydrogen bond between His26 and Glu44. Hence, one may infer that the His26-Glu44 hydrogen bond is essential for the rigidity and stability of the native protein. In its absence, the heightened flexibility of the peptide fold results in conversion of the macromolecule to a molten globule state, even at neutral pH. Ligand exchange at the sixth coordination position of the heme-iron(III) observed as the minor species (i.e., the alkaline conformer) is therefore induced by a long-range effect. This result is of interest since mutations reported to date, which stabilize the alkaline conformer, all occur in the loop including Met80. By contrast, only very minor spectroscopic (and, thus, structural) changes are observed for the His33Tyr mutant. This suggests that His33 does not form intramolecular bonds considered important for the protein structure and stability, and is consistent with the high variability of residues at position 33 in cytochromes c.",

All but the Leu mutant, which is as stable as the wild-type but has different cooperative units in the course of unfolding, showed destabilization in terms of free energy. Similar losses in free energy, however, were caused by different reasons, i.e. by increased entropy for the Ala mutant and by decreased enthalpy for the Ile mutant, with a tendency that increases in entropy are accompanied by increases in enthalpy. The gain in entropy that caused the largest loss in free energy for the Gly mutant was unexpectedly smaller than that for the Ala mutant. The changes in enthalpy and entropy induced by the mutations exhibited some correlations with hydrophobicity, while no clear correlation was found between the changes in free energy and hydrophobicity.",

Thermodynamic parameters obtained from detailed calorimetric analyses gave a nearly proportional relation between the entropy change and the enthalpy change of denaturation, i.e. T delta delta S degrees = -0.03 (+/- 0.11) + 1.14 (+/- 0.03) delta delta H, with the linear correlation coefficient 0.996 for 18 data points.

All the mutant forms lost stability, losses in free energy at 82.21 degrees C at pH 7.0 obtained by calorimetric measurements ranging from 10.3 kcal (mol dimer)-1 for the Gly mutant, which involved a loss in enthalpy without a compensating loss in entropy, to 0.84 kcal (mol dimer)-1 for the Ile mutant, which involved comparable losses in enthalpy and entropy. A gain in enthalpy for the Ala mutant was overcome by a gain in entropy, resulting in a loss in free energy by 6.78 kcal (mol dimer)-1. It was found that decreases in enthalpy and entropy showed good correlation with increasing side-chain hydrophobicity, while no such correlation was present for free energy. Replacements with Gly, Ala, Met and Phe altered the thermal denaturational scheme from N2 reversible 2D, which was the case for the Leu and Ile mutants as well as for the wild-type, to N2 reversible 2N* reversible 2D, where the first step can be regarded as a dissociation of the native dimer followed by a major unfolding in the second step. The free energy acquired by forming the dimer was estimated to be 2.03 kcal mol-1 for the Ala mutant at 66.95 degrees C at pH 9.5 and lower for the other three mutants.",

The cross-link varied in length from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. The conformational stability was determined by guanidine hydrochloride-induced equilibrium denaturation and flexibility was assessed by H2O/D2O amide exchange. The cross-link has substantial effects on both conformational stability and flexibility which depend on its length. In general, the addition of a cross-link enhances conformational stability and decreases flexibility. The optimal length for enhanced stability and decreased flexibility was the 6-carbon link. For the 6-carbon link the Gibbs free energy of unfolding was 8.0 kcal/mol compared to 4.5 kcal/mol for insulin, and the amide exchange rate decreased by at least 3-fold. A very short cross-link (i.e. the 2-carbon link) caused conformational strain that was detectable by a lack of stabilization in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding and enhancement in the amide exchange rate compared to insulin. The effect of the cross-link length on insulin hydrodynamic properties is discussed relative to previously obtained receptor binding results.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant human monoclonal antibodies have become important protein-based therapeutics for the treatment of various diseases. The antibody structure is complex, consisting of beta-sheet rich domains stabilized by multiple disulfide bridges. The dimerization of the C(H)3 domain in the constant region of the heavy chain plays a pivotal role in the assembly of an antibody. This domain contains a single buried, highly conserved disulfide bond. This disulfide bond was not required for dimerization, since a recombinant human C(H)3 domain, even in the reduced state, existed as a dimer. Spectroscopic analyses showed that the secondary and tertiary structures of reduced and oxidized C(H)3 dimer were similar, but differences were observed. The reduced C(H)3 dimer was less stable than the oxidized form to denaturation by guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), pH, or heat. Equilibrium sedimentation revealed that the reduced dimer dissociated at lower GdmCl concentration than the oxidized form. This implies that the disulfide bond shifts the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Interestingly, the dimer-monomer dissociation transition occurred at lower GdmCl concentration than the unfolding transition. Thus, disulfide bond formation in the human C(H)3 domain is important for stability and dimerization. Here we show the importance of the role played by the disulfide bond and how it affects the stability and monomer-dimer equilibrium of the human C(H)3 domain. Hence, these results may have implications for the stability of the intact antibody.",

However, the introduction of extra disulfide bonds into proteins as a general approach to protein stabilization yields rather inconsistent results. By modeling studies, we selected positions to introduce additional disulfide bonds into ribonuclease A at regions that had proven to be crucial for the initiation of the folding or unfolding process, respectively. However, only two out of the six variants proved to be more stable than unmodified ribonuclease A. The comparison of the thermodynamic and kinetic data disclosed a more pronounced effect on the unfolding reaction for all variants regardless of the position of the extra disulfide bond. Native-state proteolysis indicated a perturbation of the native state of the destabilized variants that obviously counterbalances the stability gain by the extra disulfide bond.",

The results showed that all the osmolytes applied in this study obviously prevented AK unfolding and inactivation that was due to a GdnHCl denaturant by reducing the inactivation rate constants (k(i)), increasing the transition free energy changes (DeltaDeltaG(i)) and increasing the value for the midpoint of denaturation (C(m)). Furthermore, the osmolytes remarkably prevented AK aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner during AK refolding.

        "abstract": "Although the folding of alpha-helical repeat proteins has been well characterized, much less is known about the folding of repeat proteins containing beta-sheets. Here we investigate the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of Internalin B (InlB), an extracellular virulence factor from the bacterium Lysteria monocytogenes. This domain contains seven tandem leucine-rich repeats, of which each contribute a single beta-strand that forms a continuous beta-sheet with neighboring repeats, and an N-terminal alpha-helical capping motif. Despite its modular structure, InlB folds in an equilibrium two-state manner, as reflected by the identical thermodynamic parameters obtained by monitoring its sigmoidal urea-induced unfolding transition by different spectroscopic probes. Although equilibrium two-state folding is common in alpha-helical repeat proteins, to date, InlB is the only beta-sheet-containing repeat protein for which this behavior is observed. Surprisingly, unlike other repeat proteins exhibiting equilibrium two-state folding, InlB also folds by a simple two-state kinetic mechanism lacking intermediates, aside from the effects of prolyl isomerization on the denatured state. However, like other repeat proteins, InlB also folds significantly more slowly than expected from contact order. When plotted against urea, the rate constants for the fast refolding and single unfolding phases constitute a linear chevron that, when fitted with a kinetic two-state model, yields thermodynamic parameters matching those observed for equilibrium folding. Based on these kinetic parameters, the transition state is estimated to comprise 40% of the total surface area buried upon folding, indicating that a large fraction of the native contacts are formed in the rate-limiting step to folding.",

Both proteins fold at neutral pH, although they are substantially less stable than wild type. The activity of M102K is about 35% that of wild type, while that of L133D is about 4%. M102K could be crystallized, and its structure was determined at high resolution. The crystal structure (at pH 6.8) of the mutant is very similar to that of wild type except for the alpha-helix that includes residues 108-113. In wild-type lysozyme, one side of this helix is exposed to solvent and the other contacts Met 102. In the M102K structure this alpha-helix becomes much more mobile, possibly allowing partial access of Lys 102 to solvent. The stability of M102K, determined by monitoring the unfolding of the protein with CD, is pH-dependent, consistent with the charged form of the substituted amino acid being more destabilizing than the uncharged form. The pKa of Lys 102 was estimated to be 6.5 both by differential titration and also by NMR analysis of isotopically labeled protein with 13C incorporated at the C epsilon position of all lysines. As the pH is lowered below pH 6.5, the overall three-dimensional structure of M102K at room temperature appears to be maintained to pH 3 or so, although there is evidence for some structural adjustment possibly allowing solvent accessibility to the protonated form of Lys 102.",

In this study, thermal denaturation, monitored by circular dichroism, was used to determine the free energy of denaturation of the A state (delta GA<-->D) for Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-ferricytochrome c. Specifically, we examined the wild-type protein, seven variants with amino acid substitutions at the interface between the N- and C-terminal helices, and two variants with mutations at a position close to, but not involved in, the interface. A plot of delta GA<-->D versus delta GN<-->D (the free energy of denaturation of the native state) has a slope near unity, showing that the evolutionarily conserved helix-helix interaction stabilizes the A state to the same degree that it stabilizes the native state.",

        "abstract": "The thermodynamics and kinetics of unfolding of 28 bacteriophage T4 lysozyme variants were compared by using urea gradient gel electrophoresis. The mutations studied cause a variety of sequence changes at different residues throughout the polypeptide chain and result in a wide range of thermodynamic stabilities. A striking relationship was observed between the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of the amino acid replacements: All the substitutions that destabilized the native protein by 2 kcal/mol or more also increased the rate of unfolding. The observed increases in unfolding rate corresponded to a decrease in the activation energy of unfolding (delta Gu) at least 35% as large as the decrease in thermodynamic stability (delta Gu). Thus, the destabilizing lesions bring the free energy of the native state closer to that of both the unfolded state and the transition state for folding and unfolding. Since a large fraction of the mutational destabilization is expressed between the transition state and the native conformation, the changes in folding energetics cannot be accounted for by effects on the unfolded state alone. The results also suggest that interactions throughout much of the folded structure are altered in the formation of the transition state during unfolding.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the role of W140 in the folding of Staphylococcal nuclease. For this purpose, we constructed the 19 possible substitution mutations at residue 140. Only three mutants, W140F, W140H, and W140Y, adopted native-like structures under physiological conditions and showed native-like enzymatic activities. In contrast, the other 16 mutants took on compact unfolded structures under physiological conditions and the enzymatic activities of these mutants were decreased to approximately 70% of wild-type levels. These 16 mutants maintained substrate-induced foldability. These results strongly indicate that the side-chain information encoded by residue 140 is essential to maintain a stable native structure, and that this residue must be an aromatic side chain. The order of thermal stability was wild type > W140H > W140F = W140Y. Therefore, the five-membered nitrogen-containing ring of the indole is thought to bear the essential information. In the crystal structure of staphylococcal nuclease, the five-membered ring is at the local center of the C-terminal cluster through hydrophobic interactions. This cluster plays a key role in the interaction connecting the C-terminal region and the N-terminal beta-core. Mutants other than W140H, W140F, and W140Y lost the ability to form the local core, which caused the loss of the long-range interactions between the C-terminal and N-terminal regions. Inhibitor or substrate binding to these mutants compensates for the lack of long-range interactions generated by W140.",

        "abstract": "The energetics of a salt bridge formed between the side chains of aspartic acid 70 (Asp70) and histidine 31 (His31) of T4 lysozyme have been examined by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The pKa values of the residues in the native state are perturbed from their values in the unfolded protein such that His31 has a pKa value of 9.1 in the native state and 6.8 in the unfolded state at 10 degrees C in moderate salt. Similarly, the aspartate pKa is shifted to a value of about 0.5 in the native state from its value of 3.5-4.0 in the unfolded state. These shifts in pKa show that the salt bridge is stabilized 3-5 kcal/mol. This implies that the salt bridge stabilizes the native state by 3-5 kcal/mol as compared to the unfolded state. This is reflected in the thermodynamic stability of mutants of the protein in which Asp70, His31, or both are replaced by asparagine. These observations and consideration of the thermodynamic coupling of protonation state to folding of proteins suggest a mechanism of acid denaturation in which the unfolded state is progressively stabilized by protonation of its acid residues as pH is lowered below pH 4. The unfolded state is stabilized only if acidic groups in the folded state have lower pKa values than in the unfolded state. When the pH is sufficiently low, the acid groups of both the native and unfolded states are fully protonated, and the apparent unfolding equilibrium constant becomes pH independent. Similar arguments apply to base-induced unfolding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "A gene encoding a serine-type protease has been cloned from Aquifex pyrophilus using a sequence tag containing the consensus sequence of proteases as a probe. Sequence analysis of the cloned gene reveals an open reading frame of 619 residues that has three canonical residues (Asp-140, His-184, and Ser-502) that form the catalytic site of serine-type proteases. The size of the mature form (43 kDa) and its localization in the cell wall fraction indicate that both the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of the protein are processed during maturation. When the cloned gene is expressed in Escherichia coli, it is weakly expressed as active and processed forms. The pH optimum of this protease is very broad, and its activity is completely inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The half-life of the protein is 6 h at 105 degreesC, suggesting that it is one of the most heat-stable proteases. The cysteine residues in the mature form may form disulfide bonds that are responsible for the strong stability of this protease, because the thermostability of the protein is significantly reduced in the presence of reducing reagent.",

There are three peaks P1, P2 and P3 in the curve for the system with the molar mixing ratio SDS/BSA = 1. With the increase in the amount of SDS, the peak P3 grows at the expense of P1 and P2. There is only a single peak P3 in the curve for the systems SDS/BSA > 7, and no peak at SDS/BSA = 50 and 100. There is a single peak P12 in the curve for BSA at pH 7 and in the presence of 0.05 M NaCl, indicating that the heat-induced transition is suppressed. There are two peaks P12 and P3 for the systems SDS/BSA = 1-5; the area ratio of the peak P3 to P12 increases with the increase in the amount of SDS. There is only a single peak P3 when SDS/BSA > 7, and no peak at SDS/BSA = 50. It is concluded that the peak P3 is a product of SDS regardless of the presence or absence of NaCl.

One or two ordered water molecules were found in the cavities created in some mutants (I106A, I59A and I59G). The cavity volumes for these three mutants were bigger than those that remained empty in the other mutants. The stability of the mutant proteins with the newly introduced water molecules was about 8 kJ/mol higher than that expected from the change in hydrophobic surface area (DeltaDeltaASAHP) exposed upon denaturation.

        "abstract": "Cytochrome c(551) (cyt c(551)) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a small protein (82 residues) that folds via a three-state pathway with the accumulation in the microsecond time-range of a compact collapsed intermediate. The presence of a single His residue, at position 16, permits the study of the refolding at pH 7.0 in the absence of miscoordination events. Here, we report on folding kinetics in the millisecond time-range as a function of urea under different pH conditions. Analysis of this process (over-and-above proline cis-trans isomerization) at pH 7.0, suggests the existence of a multiple transition state pathway in which we postulate three transition states. Taking advantage of site-directed mutagenesis we propose that the first \"unfolded-like\" transition state (t(1)) originates from the electrostatic properties of the collapsed state, while the second transition state (t(2)) involves the interaction between the N and C-terminal helices and is stabilized by the salt bridge between Lys10 and Glu70 ( approximately 1 kcal mol(-1)). Our results suggest that, contrary to other cytochromes c, the roll-over effect observed for cyt c(551) at low denaturant concentration can be interpreted in terms of a broad energy barrier without population of any intermediates. The third and more \"native-like\" transition state (M) can be associated with the breaking/formation of the Fe(3+)-Met61 bond. This strong interaction is stabilized by the hydrogen bond between Trp56 and heme propionate 17 (HP-17) as suggested by the increase in the unfolding rate at high denaturant concentration of the Trp56Phe site-directed mutant.",

        "abstract": "The structural and energetic perturbations caused by cavity-creating mutations (Leu-41-->Val and Leu-41-->Ala) in the dimeric 4-alpha-helical-bundle protein ROP have been characterized by CD spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Deconvolution of the CD spectra showed a decrease in alpha-helicity as a result of the amino acid exchanges that follows qualitatively the overall decrease in conformational stability. Transition enthalpies are sensitive probes of the energetic change associated with point mutations. delta H zero values at the respective transition temperatures, T 1/2 (71.0, 65.3, and 52.9 degrees C at 0.5 mg/ml) decrease from 580 +/- 20 to 461 +/- 20 kJ/(mol of dimer) and 335 +/- 20 kJ/(mol of dimer) for wild-type ROP (Steif, C., Weber, P., Hinz, H.-J., Flossdorf, J., Cesareni, G., Kokkinidis, M. Biochemistry 32:3867-3876, 1993), L41V, and L41A, respectively. The conformational stabilities at 25 degrees C expressed by the standard Gibbs energies of denaturation, delta GzeroD, are 71.7, 61.1, and 46.1 kJ/(mol of dimer). The corresponding transition enthalpies have been obtained from extrapolation using the cDp(T) and cNp(T) functions. Their values at 25 degrees C are 176.3, 101.9, and 141.7 kJ/(mol of dimer) for wild-type ROP, L41V, and L41A, respectively. When the stability perturbation resulting from the cavity creating mutations is referred to the exchange of 1 mol of CH2 group, the average delta delta GzeroD value is -5.0 +/- 1 kJ/(mol of CH2 group). This decrease in conformation stability suggests that dimeric ROP exhibits the same susceptibility to Leu-->Val and Leu-->Ala exchanges as small monomeric proteins. Careful determinations of the partial specific heat capacities of wild-type and mutated protein solutions suggest that the mutational effects are predominantly manifested in the native rather than the unfolded state.",

        "abstract": "Lactose repressor protein, regulator of lac enzyme expression in Escherichia coli, maintains its structure and function at extremely low protein concentrations (<10(-)12 M). To examine the unfolding and dissociation of this tetrameric protein, structural transitions in the presence of varying concentrations of urea were monitored by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and functional activities. The spectroscopic data demonstrated a single cooperative transition with no evidence of folded dimeric or monomeric species of this protein. These spectroscopic transitions were reversible provided a long incubation step was employed in the refolding reaction at approximately 3 M urea. The refolded repressor protein possessed the same functional and structural properties as wild-type repressor protein. The absence of concentration dependence expected for tetramer dissociation to unfolded monomer (M4 <--> 4U) in the spectral transitions indicates that the disruption of the monomer-monomer interface and monomer unfolding are a concerted reaction (M4 <--> U4) that may occur prior to the dissociation of the dimer-dimer interface. Thus, we propose that the unfolded monomers remain associated at the C-terminus by the 4-helical coiled-coil structure that forms the dimer-dimer interface and that this intermediate is the end point detected in the spectral transitions. Efforts to confirm the existence of this species by ultracentrifugation were inhibited by the aggregation of this intermediate. Based upon these observations, the wild-type fluorescence and CD data were fit to a model, M4 <--> U4, which resulted in an overall DeltaG degrees for unfolding of 40 kcal/mol. Using a mutant protein, K84L, in which the monomer-monomer interface is stabilized, sedimentation equilibrium results demonstrated that the dimer-dimer interface of lac repressor could persist at higher levels of urea than the monomer-monomer interface. The tetramer-dimer transition monitored using this mutant repressor yields a DeltaG degrees of 20.4 kcal/mol. Using this free energy value for the dissociation process of U4 <--> 4U, an overall free energy change of approximately 60 kcal/mol was calculated for dissociation of all interfaces and unfolding of the tetrameric lac repressor, reflecting the exceptional stability of this protein.",

        "abstract": "To get new structural insights into different phases of the renaturation of ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1), the refolding of the thermally unfolded protein was initiated by rapid temperature jumps and detected by time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The characteristic spectral changes monitoring the formation of secondary structure and tertiary contacts were followed on a time scale of 10(-3) to 10(3) seconds permitting the characterization of medium and slow folding reactions. Additionally, structural information on the folding events that occurred within the experimental dead time was indirectly accessed by comparative analysis of kinetic and steady-state refolding data. At slightly destabilizing refolding temperatures of 45 degrees C, which is close to the unfolding transition region, no specific secondary or tertiary structure is formed within 180 ms. After this delay all infrared markers bands diagnostic for individual structural elements indicate a strongly cooperative and relatively fast folding, which is not complicated by the accumulation of intermediates. At strongly native folding temperatures of 20 degrees C, a folding species of RNase T1 is detected within the dead time, which already possesses significant amounts of antiparallel beta-sheets, turn structures, and to some degree tertiary contacts. The early formed secondary structure is supposed to comprise the core region of the five-stranded beta-sheet. Despite these nativelike characteristics the subsequent refolding events are strongly heterogeneous and slow. The refolding under strongly native conditions is completed by an extremely slow formation or rearrangement of a locally restricted beta-sheet region accompanied by the further consolidation of turns and denser backbone packing. It is proposed that these late events comprise the final packing of strand 1 (residues 40-42) of the five-stranded beta-sheet against the rest of this beta-sheet system within an otherwise nativelike environment. This conclusion was supported by the comparison of refolding of RNase T1 and its variant W59Y RNase T1 that enabled the assignment of these very late events to the trans-->cis isomerization reaction of the prolyl peptide bond preceding Pro-39.",

It is shown that the thermal transition of interleukin-1 beta is completely reversible below pH 2.5, only partly reversible in the pH range 2.5-3.5, and irreversible above pH 3.5. Analysis of the reversible unfolding of interleukin-1 beta shows that the heat denaturation is well approximated by a two-state transition and is accompanied by a significant increase of heat capacity. The partial heat capacity of denatured interleukin-1 beta is very close to that expected for the completely unfolded protein. This permitted us to assign the thermodynamic characteristics of interleukin-1 beta denaturation to its complete unfolding and to correlate them with structural features of the protein. The contributions of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions to the stability of interleukin-1 beta are analyzed and compared to those for other globular proteins. It is shown that the Gibbs energy of a hydrogen bond in a beta-sheet structure is greater than in alpha-helices.",

        "abstract": "All known cochaperonin protein 10 (cpn10) molecules are heptamers of seven identical subunits noncovalently linked by beta-strand interactions. Cpn10 from the deep-branching, hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (Aacpn10) shows high homology with mesophilic and other thermophilic cpn10 sequences, except for a 25-residue C-terminal extension not found in any other cpn10. Prior to atomic structure information, we here address the role of the tail by biophysical means. A tail-lacking variant (Aacpn10-del25) also adopts a heptameric structure in solution and exhibits nativelike substrate-refolding activity. Thermal and chemical perturbations of both Aacpn10 and Aacpn10-del25, probed by far-UV circular dichroism, demonstrate that both proteins have high thermodynamic stability. Heptamer-monomer dissociation midpoints were defined by isothermal titration calorimetry; at 25 degrees C, the values for Aacpn10 and Aacpn10-del25 are within 2-fold of each other and close to reported midpoints for mesophilic cpn10 proteins. In contrast, the monomer stabilities for the A. aeolicus proteins are significantly higher than those of mesophilic homologues at 30 degrees C; thus, heptamer thermophily is a result of more stable monomers. Electron microscopy data reveals that Aacpn10-del25 heptamers are prone to stack on top of each other forming chainlike molecules; the electrostatic surface pattern of a structural model can explain this behavior. Taken together, the unique tail in Aacpn10 is not required for heptamer structure, stability, or function; instead, it appears to be an ancient strategy to avoid cochaperonin aggregation at extreme temperatures.",

The protein contains a long alpha-helical stretch between residues 32 and 49. The central residue of this helix, Pro40, has been replaced by Ser. The stabilities of the oxidized states of two proteins, the single mutant M37L and the double mutant M37L,P40S, have been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and also by a series of isothermal guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) melts in the temperature range of 277 to 333 K. The P40S mutation was found to stabilize the protein at all temperatures upto 340 K though both proteins had similar Tm values of about 356 K. At 298 K, the M37L,P40S mutant was found to be more stable than M37L by 1.5 kcal/mol. A combined analysis of GuHCl and calorimetric data was carried out to determine the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity change upon unfolding. At 298 K there was a large, stabilizing enthalpic effect in P40S though significant enthalpy-entropy compensation was observed and the two proteins had similar values of deltaCp. Thus, replacement of a Pro in the interior of an alpha helix can have substantial effects on protein stability.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the thermodynamic and kinetic response of WT* ubiquitin (F45W) and three mutants to high concentrations of glucose, sucrose and dextran under physiological temperature and pH. WT* ubiquitin was stabilised by the same amount when comparing each cosolute on a weight to volume ratio, with cosolute effects largely independent of denaturant concentration. The energy difference between the mutants and WT* ubiquitin also remained the same in high concentrations of cosolute. An apparent decrease in transition-state surface burial in the presence of the cosolutes was attributed to increased compaction of the denatured state, and not to the Hammond effect. Together, these results suggest higher thermodynamic stabilities and folding rates for proteins in vivo compared to in vitro, in addition to more compact denatured states. Because the effects of mutation are the same in dilute solution and crowded conditions used to mimic the cellular environment, there is validity in using measurements of mutant stabilities made in dilute solutions to inform on how the mutations may affect stability in vivo.",

        "abstract": "The structure and function of the photosystem II PsbO extrinsic protein is under intense research, being an essential part of the biomolecular engine that carries out water oxidation and oxygen production. This paper presents a structural analysis of the isolated PsbO protein by FTIR spectroscopy, reporting detailed secondary structure quantification and changes in the secondary structure content of the protein attributed to the effect of calcium (Ca(2+)). Measurements in H(2)O and D(2)O have allowed us to see the effect of calcium on the conformation of the protein. The results indicate that (i) the protein presents a major content of beta-structure (i.e., beta-sheet, beta-strands, beta-turns) as detected by the infrared bands at 1624-1625, 1678-1679, 1688-1689 cm(-1), which account for about 38% in water and 33% in heavy water, in the presence of calcium; and (ii) the amount of this beta-structure fraction increases 7-10% in the absence of calcium, with a concomitant decrease in loops and nonordered structure. The thermal denaturation profile of the protein in the presence of calcium showed low stability with T(m) approximately 56 degrees C. This profile also shows a second phase of denaturation above 60 degrees C and the appearance of aggregation signals above 70 degrees C. Our observations indicate that calcium is able to modify the conformation of the protein at least in solution and confirm that PsbO is mainly a beta-protein where beta-sheet is the major ordered secondary structure element of the protein core.",

Equilibrium techniques were used to determine the equilibrium free energies of unfolding for the mutant proteins to permit comparison with the wild-type protein. The sum of the changes in stability for the single mutants is not equal to the change seen in the double mutant. This inequality is evidence for a structural interaction between these two residues.

Computer model building had suggested that this substitution would allow formation of an intersubunit disulfide without disruption of the dimer structure [Pabo, C. O., & Suchanek, E. G.

We find that the Cys-88 protein forms a disulfide-bonded dimer that is very stable to reduction by dithiothreitol and has increased operator DNA binding activity. The covalent Cys88-Cys88' dimer is also considerably more stable than the wild-type protein to thermal denaturation or urea denaturation. As a control, Tyr-85 was replaced with cysteine. A Cys85-Cys85' disulfide cannot form without disrupting the wild-type structure, and we find that this disulfide bond reduces the DNA binding activity and stability of the N-terminal domain.",

The fragment exhibits all the thermodynamic properties of small globular proteins with respect to heat capacity and transitional changes of enthalpy, Gibbs energy and heat capacity.

Heats of mixing of SN as a function of [GdnHCl] were determined at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C. The resulting plot of DeltaH(mix) vs [GdnHCl] exhibits a sigmoid shaped curve with linear pre- and post-denaturational base lines. Extending the pre- and post-denaturational lines to zero [GdnHCl] gives a calorimetric DeltaH (DeltaH(cal)) of 24.1 +/- 1.0 kcal/mol, for SN denaturation in the limit of zero GdnHCl concentration. Guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation Gibbs energy changes in the limit of zero denaturant concentration (DeltaG degrees (N)(-)(D)) at pH 7. 0 were determined for SN from fluorescence measurements at fixed temperatures over the range from 15 to 35 degrees C. Analysis of the resulting temperature-dependent DeltaG degrees (N)(-)(D) data defines a van't Hoff denaturation enthalpy change (DeltaH(vH)) of 26. 4 +/- 2.8 kcal/mol. The model-dependent van't Hoff DeltaH(vH) divided by the model-independent DeltaH(cal) gives a ratio of 1.1 +/- 0.1 for DeltaH(vH)/DeltaH(cal), a result that rules out the presence of thermodynamically important intermediate states in the GdnHCl-induced denaturation of SN. The likelihood that GdnHCl-induced SN denaturation involves a special type of two-state denaturation, known as a variable two-state process, is discussed in terms of the thermodynamic implications of the process.",

        "abstract": "Ataxin-3 is a member of the polyglutamine family of proteins, which are associated with at least nine different neurodegenerative diseases. In the disease state, expansion of the polyglutamine tract leads to dysfunction and death of neurons, as well as formation of proteinaceous aggregates known as nuclear inclusions. Intriguingly, both expanded and non-expanded forms of ataxin-3 are observed within these nuclear inclusions. Ataxin-3 is the smallest of the polyglutamine disease proteins and in its expanded form causes the neurodegenerative disorder Machado-Joseph disease. Using a non-pathological variant containing 28 residues in its polyglutamine tract, we have probed the folding and misfolding pathways of ataxin-3. We describe here the first equilibrium folding pathway delineated for any polyglutamine protein and show that ataxin-3 folds reversibly via a single intermediate species. We have also explored further the misfolding potential of the protein and found that partial destabilization of ataxin-3 by chemical denaturation leads to the formation of fibrillar aggregates by the non-pathological variant. These results provide an insight into the possible mechanisms by which polyglutamine expansion may affect the stability and conformation of the protein. The implications of this are considered in the wider context of the development and pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases.",

The results of equilibrium studies of the urea-induced unfolding reaction of the wild-type and mutant proteins in which phenylalanine 22 is replaced by leucine, isoleucine, and valine can be understood in terms of a selective decrease in the interaction energy between the two folding units; the intrinsic stability of each folding unit is not significantly altered. Kinetic studies of the rate-limiting step in unfolding show that the interaction energy appears in the transition state preceding the native conformation. Comparisons of the individual effects of these nonpolar side chains show that both hydrophobic and steric effects play important roles in the interaction energy between the folding units. The implication of these results is that the high cooperativity observed in the folding of many globular proteins may be reduced by appropriate amino acid replacements.",

The fluorescence properties of each of the single-tryptophan mutants were studied in the native state and as a function of guanidine-HCl-mediated unfolding, and their IgG binding activities were determined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The free energies of folding and of binding to IgG for each mutant were compared with those for the native domains. The effect of each substitution upon the overall structure and upon the IgG binding interface was modelled by molecular graphics and energy minimization.

        "abstract": "We introduced a novel disulfide bond, modeled on that of bullfrog cytochrome c, into yeast iso-1-cytochrome c. The disulfide spontaneously forms upon purification. A variety of techniques were used to examine the denaturation of this variant and several non-cross-linked controls. Denaturation is reversible and, with the exception of the protein in which the two cysteines are blocked, consistent with a two-state process. Comparison of the calorimetric and van't Hoff enthalpy changes indicates that denaturation is two-state at pH 4.6. Calorimetric and fluorescence-monitored guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation data indicate that the free energy of denaturation for the cross-linked protein (delta Gd at 300 K) is decreased relative to non-cross-linked controls. The dependence of delta Gd on GdnHCl concentration, the GdnHCl concentration that denatures half the protein, as well as the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity changes (mGdnHCl, Cm, delta Hd, delta Sd, and delta Cp, respectively), all decrease in magnitude upon introduction of the cross-link. The decrease in delta Hd and delta Sd were confirmed by monitoring absorbance at several wavelengths as a function of temperature. The cross-link also decreases the pH dependence of these observables. Circular dichroism studies indicate the denatured state of the cross-linked protein possesses more structure than non-cross-linked proteins, and this structure is refractory to increases in temperature and chemical denaturant. We conclude that the diminished values of delta Gd, delta Hd, delta Sd, delta Cp, and mGdnHCl result from the denatured state of the cross-linked variant being more compact and possessing more structure than non-cross-linked controls.",

        "abstract": "Thermal stability of the pore-forming domain of colicin A was studied by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. In the pH range between 8 and 5, the thermal denaturation of the protein in solution occurs at 66-69 degrees C and is characterized by the calorimetric enthalpy of approximately 90 kcal/M. At pH below 5, there is a rapid pH-dependent destabilization of the pore-forming domain resulting in the lowering of the midpoint denaturation temperature and a decrease in the calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation. Circular dichroism spectra in the near and far ultraviolet show that the thermotropic transition is associated with collapse of the native tertiary structure of the pore-forming domain, although a large proportion of the helical secondary structure remains preserved. The present data indicate some similarity also between acid-induced and temperature-induced denaturation of the pore-forming domain of colicin A. Association of the pore-forming domain with phospholipid vesicles of dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol results in total disappearance of the calorimetric transition, even at pH values as high as 7. Since lipid binding also induces collapse of the near ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum, these data indicate that interaction with the membrane facilitates a conformational change within the pore-forming domain to a looser (denaturated-like) state. These findings are discussed in relation to the recent model (van der Goot, F. G., Gonzalez-Manas, J. M., Lakey, J. H., Pattus, F.

        "abstract": "Described here is a mass spectrometry- and H/D exchange-based approach for the detection of equilibrium intermediate state(s) in protein-folding reactions. The approach utilizes the stability of unpurified proteins from rates of H/D exchange (SUPREX) technique to measure the m value (i.e., delta DeltaG/delta [denaturant] value) associated with the folding reaction of a protein. Such SUPREX m-value analyses can be made over a wide range of denaturant concentrations. Thus, the described approach is well-suited for the detection of high-energy intermediates that might be populated at low denaturant concentrations and hard to detect in conventional chemical denaturation experiments using spectroscopic probes. The approach is demonstrated on four known non-two-state folding proteins, including alpha-lactalbumin, cytochrome c, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP), and myoglobin. The non-two-state folding behavior of each model protein system was detected by the described method. The cytochrome c, myoglobin, and IFABP systems each had high-energy intermediate states that were undetected in conventional optical spectroscopy-based studies and previously required other more specialized biophysical approaches (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based methods and protease protection assays) for their detection. The SUPREX-based approach outlined here offers an attractive alternative to these other approaches, because it has the advantage of speed and the ability to analyze both purified and unpurified protein samples in either concentrated or dilute solution.",

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of lysozyme was studied at pH 2 in aqueous mixtures of methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The most obvious effect of alcohols was the lowering of Td, the temperature of denaturation, increasingly with higher alcohol concentration and longer alkyl chain. Both the calorimetric and van't Hoff enthalpies of denaturation initially increased and then decreased with increasing alcohol concentration, the ratio of the two enthalpies being nearly unity, 1.007 +/- 0.011, indicating the validity of the two-state approximation for the unfolding of lysozyme in these solvent systems. The reversibility of the denaturation was demonstrated by the reversibility of the DSC curves and the complete recovery of enzymic activity on cooling. The changes in heat capacity on unfolding decreased with increasing alcohol concentration for each alcohol. Experimentally determined values of denaturation temperature and of entropy and heat capacity changes were used to derive the additional thermodynamic parameters delta G degrees and delta S degrees for denaturation as a function of temperature for each alcohol--water mixture. Comparison of the thermodynamic parameters with those reported [Pfeil, W., & Privalov, P.L. (1976) Biophys. Chem. 4, 23--50] in aqueous solution at various values of pH and guanidine hydrochloride concentration showed that these latter changes have no effect on the heat capacity changes, whereas the addition of alcohols causes a sharp decrease.",

The choice of appropriate denaturant conditions inside the transition range permitted, in combination with equilibrium transition curves, the determination of both unfolding and refolding rate constants. The ratio of the rate constants at zero denaturant concentration provided equilibrium constants and standard free energy changes that are in good agreement with values obtained in previous differential scanning calorimetry studies. The DeltaG0D values for 19, 25 and 40 degrees C calculated from the present kinetic studies are, respectively, 66.8, 70.8 and 57.2 kJ.mol-1. The unfolding reactions are extremely slow under these conditions. Equilibrium was reached only after 18, 12 and 6 days at 19, 25 and 40 degrees C.

        "abstract": "The conformational stability and reversibility of unfolding of the human dimeric enzyme Cu Zn superoxide dismutase (HSOD) and the three mutant enzymes constructed by replacement of Cys6 by Ala and Cys111 by Ser, singly and in combination, were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The differential scanning calorimetry profile of wild-type HSOD consists of two components, which probably represent the unfolding of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme, with denaturation temperatures (Tm) of 74.9 and 83.6 degrees C, approximately 7 degrees lower than those for bovine superoxide dismutase (BSOD). The conformational stabilities of the two components of the mutant HSOD's differ only slightly from those of the wild type (delta delta Gs of -0.2 to +0.8 kcal/mol of dimer), while replacement of the BSOD Cys6 by Ala is somewhat destabilizing (delta delta G of -0.7 to -1.3 kcal/mol of dimer). These small alterations in conformational stability do not correlate with the large increases in resistance to thermal inactivation following substitution of free Cys in both HSOD and BSOD (McRee, D.E., Redford, S.M., Getzoff, E.D., Lepock, J.R., Hallewell, R.A., and Tainer, J.A.

(1991) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet., submitted for publication). The reversibility of unfolding was determined by scanning part way through the profile, cooling, rescanning, and calculating the amount of protein irreversibly unfolded by the first scan. The order of reversibility at a constant level of unfolding is the same as the order of resistance to inactivation for both the HSOD and BSOD wild-type and mutant enzymes. Thus, the greater resistance to thermal inactivation of the superoxide dismutase enzymes with free Cys replaced by Ala or Ser is dominated by a greater resistance to irreversible unfolding and relatively unaffected by changes in conformational stability.",

        "abstract": "Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) from Locusta migratoria is a model exchangeable apolipoprotein that plays a key role in neutral lipid transport. The protein is comprised of a bundle of five amphipathic alpha-helices, with most hydrophobic residues buried in the protein interior. The low stability of apoLp-III is thought to be crucial for lipid-induced helix bundle opening, to allow protein-lipid interactions. The presence of polar residues in the hydrophobic protein interior may facilitate this role. To test this, two buried polar residues, Thr-31 and Thr-144, were changed into alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Secondary structure analysis and GdnHCl- and temperature-induced denaturation studies indicated an increase in alpha-helical content and protein stability for T31A apoLp-III compared to wild-type apoLp-III. In contrast, T144A had a decreased alpha-helical content and protein stability, while tryptophan fluorescence indicated increased exposure of the hydrophobic interior to buffer. Two mutant proteins that had lysine residues introduced in the hydrophobic core displayed a more pronounced decrease in secondary structure and protein stability. Lipid binding studies using phospholipid vesicles showed that T31A apoLp-III was able to transform phospholipid vesicles into discoidal particles but at a 3-fold reduced rate compared to wild-type apoLp-III. In contrast, the less stable apoLp-III mutants displayed an increased ability to transform phospholipid vesicles. These results demonstrate the inverse correlation between protein stability and the ability to transform phospholipid vesicles into discoidal protein-lipid complexes and that Thr-31 is a key determinant of the relatively low protein stability, thereby promoting apoLp-III to interact with lipid surfaces.",

        "abstract": "The second WW domain in mammalian Salvador protein (SAV1 WW2) is quite atypical, as it forms a beta-clam-like homodimer. The second WW domain in human MAGI1 (membrane associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 1) (MAGI1 WW2) shares high sequence similarity with SAV1 WW2, suggesting comparable dimerization. However, an analytical ultracentrifugation study revealed that MAGI1 WW2 (Leu355-Pro390) chiefly exists as a monomer at low protein concentrations, with an association constant of 1.3 x 10(2) M(-1). We determined its solution structure, and a structural comparison with the dimeric SAV1 WW2 suggested that an Asp residue is crucial for the inhibition of the dimerization. The substitution of this acidic residue with Ser resulted in the dimerization of MAGI1 WW2. The spin-relaxation data suggested that the MAGI1 WW2 undergoes a dynamic process of transient dimerization that is limited by the charge repulsion. Additionally, we characterized a longer construct of this WW domain with a C-terminal extension (Leu355-Glu401), as the formation of an extra alpha-helix was predicted. An NMR structural determination confirmed the formation of an alpha-helix in the extended C-terminal region, which appears to be independent from the dimerization regulation. A thermal denaturation study revealed that the dimerized MAGI1 WW2 with the Asp-to-Ser mutation gained apparent stability in a protein concentration-dependent manner. A structural comparison between the two constructs with different lengths suggested that the formation of the C-terminal alpha-helix stabilized the global fold by facilitating contacts between the N-terminal linker region and the main body of the WW domain.",

In both proteins, the presence of the disulfide bond increased the T(m) by approximately 40 degrees C. In the single-chain background, the disulfide bond stabilized Arc by 8.5 kcal/mol relative to the reduced form, a significantly larger degree of stabilization than caused by other engineered disulfides and most natural disulfides. This exceptional stabilization arises from a modest effective concentration of the Cys11-Cys11' disulfide in the native state (71 M) and an anomalously low effective concentration in the denatured state (40 microM). Disulfide cross-linking of the two beta strands in the single-chain Arc background accelerated refolding by a factor of 170 into the sub-microsecond time scale. However, the major energetic effect of the disulfide occurs after the transition state for Arc refolding, slowing unfolding by 200 000-fold.",

An amyloid-associated protein readily formed amyloid fibrils in vitro and had a lower free energy of unfolding than a homologous nonpathological protein, which did not form fibrils in vitro. H-D exchange was much faster for the pathological protein, suggesting it had a greater fraction of partially folded molecules. The thermodynamic stabilizer sucrose completely inhibited fibril formation by the pathological protein and shifted the values for its physical parameters to those measured for the nonpathological protein in buffer alone. Conversely, urea sufficiently destabilized the nonpathological protein such that its measured physical properties were equivalent to those of the pathological protein in buffer, and it formed fibrils. Thus, fibril formation by light chains is predominantly controlled by thermodynamic stability; and a rational strategy to inhibit amyloidosis is to design high affinity ligands that specifically increase the stability of the native protein.",

        "abstract": "The reversible denaturation by urea of beta-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus was followed in the presence and absence of ammonium sulphate by circular dichroism studies, difference absorption spectroscopy and measurement of enzyme activity. The multiple unfolding and refolding transitions demonstrate the existence of a thermodynamically stable state of intermediate conformation in equilibrium with the native (N) and fully unfolded (U) states. Its physical properties show that it is identical to the state H found on denaturation by guanidinium chloride. State H is 10.1 (+/-1.5) kJ mol-1 less stable than the native state and 10.1 (+/-1.6) kJ mol-1 more stable than the unfolded state. Ammonium sulphate shifts both the N in equilibrium H and H in equilibrium U transitions to concentrations of urea higher by 5.3 M per mole of sulphate. It has markedly different effects on the thermodynamic stabilities of states N and H, making delta G'N-H, O and delta G'H-U, O more negative by 41 kJ mol and 20 kJ mole, respectively, per mole of ammonium sulphate. The change in equilibrium constant for the N-H transition is reflected almost exclusively in a dramatic change of the unfolding rate constant, which is decreased by a factor of 10(11) on addition of 1.4 M-sulphate. The presence of the substrate benzyl penicillin has little effect on the equilibria or kinetics of the N-H transition. The results are discussed in terms of the nature of the N-H transition and of the ordering of intermediate states on the folding pathway.",

It does not unfold in non-denaturing buffer between 0 and 100 degrees C and thermal denaturation is only achieved at high concentrations of guanidinium chloride (4-6 M). In these solutions the protein structure is lost at decreasing (cold denaturation) and increasing temperatures (heat denaturation). In the cold denaturation region, the melting profile showed deviations from the theory of Privalov et al. [P.L. Privalov, V. Griko Yu, S. Venyaminov, V.P. Kutyshenko, Cold denaturation of myoglobin, J. Mol. Biol. 190 (1986) 487-498] probably due to deviations from a two-state mechanism. High thermal stability as well as cold and heat denaturation was also observed for a mutant of the coiled-coil domain of COMP in which glutamine 54 was replaced by isoleucine but it still forms pentamer. The melting temperatures in plain buffer for the heat denaturation of COMP coiled-coil domain and its mutant obtained by extrapolation to zero molar guanidinium chloride concentration are approximately 160 and 220 degrees C, respectively, which groups them among the most stable proteins.",

        "abstract": "The thermal denaturation of the dimeric enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied by spectroscopic and calorimetric methods. At low protein concentration the structural transition proved to be reversible in thermal scannings conducted at a rate greater than 1.0 degrees C min(-1). Under these conditions, however, the denaturation-renaturation cycle exhibited marked hysteresis. The use of lower scanning rates lead to pronounced irreversibility. Kinetic studies indicated that denaturation of the enzyme likely consists of an initial first-order reaction that forms thermally unfolded (U) TIM, followed by irreversibility-inducing reactions which are probably linked to aggregation of the unfolded protein. As judged from CD measurements, U possesses residual secondary structure but lacks most of the tertiary interactions present in native TIM. Furthermore, the large increment in heat capacity upon denaturation suggests that extensive exposure of surface area occurs when U is formed. Above 63 degrees C, reactions leading to irreversibility were much slower than the unfolding process; as a result, U was sufficiently long-lived as to allow an investigation of its refolding kinetics. We found that U transforms into nativelike TIM through a second-order reaction in which association is coupled to the regain of secondary structure. The rate constants for unfolding and refolding of TIM displayed temperature dependences resembling those reported for monomeric proteins but with considerably larger activation enthalpies. Such large temperature dependences seem to be determinant for the occurrence of kinetically controlled transitions and thus constitute a simple explanation for the hysteresis observed in thermal scannings.",

His epsilon proton resonances were used as reporter groups to measure fractions of folded and unfolded species. Gibbs energy differences between folded and unfolded species were obtained as functions of pressure for different temperatures and as functions of temperature for different pressures. The volume increase upon unfolding, delta V, was negative and temperature-dependent, decreasing from -10 ml/mol at 7.5 degrees C to -30 ml/mol at 37 degrees C. From the least squares-fitting of experimental Gibbs energy differences to a theoretical expression holding pressure and delta Cp constant, we determined best-fit values of delta G, delta H, delta S and delta Cp for different values of pressure in the temperature range 7.5 to 40 degrees C. We found that delta Cp is dependent on pressure, decreasing from 1.79 kcal/mol K at 1 atm to 1.08 kcal/mol K at 2000 atm. These findings appear to be consistent with a notion that the state of hydration of non-polar side-chains upon unfolding of the protein is a major factor that determines the pressure dependence of the conformational stability of ribonuclease A under the chosen experimental condition.",

It binds to lipid rafts and interacts specifically with cholesterol-rich lipid domains. In this study, ostreolysin was classified as a single-domain all-beta-structured protein on the basis of cDNA sequencing. pH-induced and thermally induced unfolding of ostreolysin was studied by means of CD, UV absorption, and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to characterize conformational transitions associated with its functional properties, i.e., binding to lipid membranes, pore forming activity on lipid vesicles, and hemolysis. At 25 degrees C and between pH 6 and 9, ostreolysin adopted a monomeric and thermodynamically stable nativelike conformation, characterized by rigid tertiary structure and predominantly beta-sheet secondary structure. Between pH 2 and 3, the protein underwent an irreversible transition to a partially unfolded, molten globule-like state which bound ANS, and exhibited disrupted tertiary structure and enhanced non-native alpha-helical structure. Functional studies showed that, unlike colicins and some other bacterial pore-forming toxins, the acid-induced molten globule-like state of ostreolysin is not relevant for lipid binding and pore formation. Instead, the compact native state was necessary for binding to cholesterol/sphingomyelin multilamellar vesicles, optimally in the pH range from 6 to 7, and for pore formation and hemolysis, maximally between pH 7 and 8.",

Extensive domain-domain interactions involve three segments of the polypeptide chain that are distant from one another in the primary sequence: the N-terminus, the C-terminus, and a centrally located alpha-helix. In order to monitor spectroscopically the conformational changes that occur in the individual domains and at the interdomain interface during the unfolding process, we have constructed a series of single-tryptophan mutants. In addition to two previously described mutants, each with single tryptophans in the C-terminal domain (W308 and W333) [Szpikowska, B. K., Beechem, J. M., Sherman, M. A., & Mas, M. T. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 2217-2225], four new single-tryptophan mutants have been constructed: two with tryptophans located in the interdomain region (W194 and W399) and two with tryptophans in the N-terminal domain (W48 and W122). The equilibrium unfolding transitions induced by guanidine hydrochloride were monitored using far-UV CD, near-UV CD, steady-state, and time-resolved fluorescence. These studies reveal two unfolding transitions and suggest a sequential unfolding process for the mutants described in this paper. During the first transition (Cm approximately 0.5 M) the interdomain region and C-terminal domain unfold; the N-terminal domain remains relatively compact but lacks much of the tertiary structure that characterizes the native state. A hyperfluorescent intermediate is detected during this transition by tryptophan probes placed within the N-terminal domain.

        "abstract": "GrpE is the nucleotide exchange factor for the Escherichia coli molecular chaperone DnaK, the prokaryotic homologue of Hsp70. Thermodynamic properties of GrpE structural domains were characterized by examining a number of structural and point mutants using circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation. These structural domains are the long paired N-terminal helices, the central four-helix bundle, and the C-terminal compact beta-domains. We show that the central four-helix bundle (t(m) approximately 75 degrees C) provides a stable platform for the association of the long paired N-terminal helices (t(m) approximately 50 degrees C), which can then function as a temperature sensor. The stability of the N-terminal helices is linked to the presence of the C-terminal compact beta-domains of GrpE, providing a potential mechanism for coupling of DnaK-binding activity of GrpE with temperature. On the basis of our thermodynamic analysis of E.coli GrpE, we present a structure-based model for the melting properties of the nucleotide exchange factor, wherein the long paired helices function as a molecular thermocouple.",

Because the lysozyme inactivation was caused by the accumulation of multiple chemical reactions, including the isomerization of the Asp-Gly sequence and the deamidation of Asn [Tomizawa et al. (1994) Biochemistry, 33, 13032-13037], the suppression of these reactions by the substitution of Gly to Ala, or the introduction of a sequence of human-type lysozyme, was attempted and the mutants (where each or all labile sequences were replaced) were prepared. The substitution resulted in the reversible destabilization from 1 to 2 kcal/mol per substitution. The destabilization was caused by the introduction of beta-carbon to the constrained position that had conformational angles within the allowed range for the Gly residue. Despite the decrease in the reversible conformational stability, the mutants had more resistance to irreversible inactivation at pH 4 and 100 degrees C. In particular, the rate of irreversible inactivation of the mutant, which was replaced at four chemically labile sequences, was the latest and corresponded to approximately 18 kcal/mol of the reversible conformational stability. Therefore, replacement of the chemically labile sequence was found to be more effective at protecting enzymes against irreversible thermoinactivation than at strengthening reversible conformational stability.",

        "abstract": "A number of mutations have been shown previously to stabilize T4 lysozyme. By combining up to seven such mutations in the same protein, the melting temperature was incrementally increased by up to 8.3 degrees C at pH 5.4 (delta delta G = 3.6 kcal/mol). This shows that it is possible to engineer a protein of enhanced thermostability by combining a series of rationally designed point mutations. It is also shown that this stabilization is achieved with only minor, localized changes in the structure of the protein. This is consistent with the observation that the change in stability of each of the multiple mutants is, in each case, additive, i.e. equal to the sum of the stability changes associated with the constituent single mutants. One of the seven substitutions, Asn116-->Asp, changes a residue that participates in substrate binding; not surprisingly, it causes a significant loss in activity. Ignoring this mutation, there is a gradual reduction in activity as successively more mutations are combined.",

        "abstract": "Barstar, a small globular protein which undergoes reversible unfolding, is a good candidate for studies on protein folding. It possesses two cysteine residues that complicate folding studies by forming a variable mixture of disulfide-bridged forms. We have constructed and analyzed, therefore, a double mutant Cys40-->Ala,Cys82-->Ala. Equilibrium unfolding with urea follows a simple two-step mechanism. The midpoint for unfolding ([U]1/2) is 3.87 +/- 0.03 M urea, with m(delta delta G/delta [urea]) = 1.25 +/- 0.04 kcal/mol2. The free energy of unfolding, delta GU-FH2O, is 4.84 +/- 0.18 kcal/mol. Identical results were found on monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence or the circular dichroism signal at 221 nm, showing that the transition is due to the global denaturation of the protein. Barstar contains two proline residues, one of which (Pro48) has a cis N-aminoacyl bond conformation in the folded state. A transiently generated form of the unfolded protein, which contains the proline residues in their native conformations, has a rate constant for refolding (31 s-1) similar to that for refolding of the equilibrium-unfolded protein, which results in a \"misfolded\" form of the protein (32 s-1). The two refolded states are different: the free energies of unfolding measured from kinetic constants for the native and misfolded variants are 5.4 +/- 0.3 and 2.85 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The rate constant for the unfolding in water of the misfolded protein is 0.87 s-1, compared with 0.068 s-1 for the unfolding of the native protein. This difference can be explained by a nonnative trans peptidyl-proline bond at position 48 in the misfolded protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Important stabilizing features for the collagen triple helix include the presence of Gly as every third residue, a high content of imino acids, and interchain hydrogen bonds. Host-guest peptides have been used previously to characterize triple-helix propensities of individual residues and Gly-X-Y triplets. Here, comparison of the thermal stabilities of host-guest peptides of the form (Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-X-Y-Gly-X'-Y'-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3 extends the study to adjacent tripeptide sequences, to encompass the major classes of potential direct intramolecular interactions. Favorable hydrophobic interactions were observed, as well as stabilizing intrachain interactions between residues of opposite charge in the i and i + 3 positions. However, the greatest gain in triple-helix stability was achieved in the presence of Gly-Pro-Lys-Gly-Asp/Glu-Hyp sequences, leading to a T(m) value equal to that seen for a Gly-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Pro-Hyp sequence. This stabilization is seen for Lys but not for Arg and can be assigned to interchain ion pairs, as shown by molecular modeling. Computational analysis shows that Lys-Gly-Asp/Glu sequences are present at a frequency much greater than expected in collagen, suggesting this interaction is biologically important. These results add significantly to the understanding of which surface ion pairs can contribute to protein stability.",

        "abstract": "A short C-terminal fragment of immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G is known to form nativelike beta-hairpin at physiological conditions. To understand the cooperative folding of the short peptide, eight Ala-substituted mutants of the fragment were investigated with respect to their structural stabilities by analyzing temperature dependence of NMR signals. On comparison of the obtained thermodynamic parameters, we found that the nonpolar residues Tyr45 and Phe52 and the polar residues Asp46 and Thr49 are crucial for the beta-hairpin folding. The results suggest a strong interaction between the nonpolar side chains that participates in a putative hydrophobic cluster and that the polar side chains form a fairly rigid conformation around the loop (46-51). We also investigated the complex formation of the mutants with N-terminal fragment at the variety of temperature to get their thermal unfolding profiles and found that the mutations on the residues Asp46 and Thr49 largely destabilized the complexes, while substitution of Asp47 slightly stabilized the complex. From these results, we deduced that both the hydrophobic cluster formation and the rigidity of the loop (46-51) cooperatively stabilize the beta-hairpin structure of the fragment. These interactions which form a stable beta-hairpin may be the initial structural scaffold which is important in the early folding events of the whole domain.",

        "abstract": "Epithelial cadherin is a transmembrane protein that is essential in calcium-dependent cell-cell recognition and adhesion. It contains five independently folded globular domains in its extracellular region. Each domain has a seven-strand beta-sheet immunoglobulin fold. Short seven-residue peptide segments connect the globular domains and provide oxygens to chelate calcium ions at the interface between the domains (Nagar et al., Nature 1995;380:360-364). Recently, stability studies of ECAD2 (Prasad et al., Biochemistry 2004;43:8055-8066) were undertaken with the motivation that Domain 2 is a representative domain for this family of proteins. The definition of a domain boundary is somewhat arbitrary; hence, it was important to examine the effect of the adjoining linker regions that connect Domain 2 to the adjacent domains. Present studies employ temperature-denaturation and proteolytic susceptibility to provide insight into the impact of these linkers on Domain 2. The significant findings of our present study are threefold. First, the linker segments destabilize the core domain in the absence of calcium. Second, the destabilization due to addition of the linker segments can be partially reversed by the addition of calcium. Third, sodium chloride stabilizes all constructs. This result implies that electrostatic repulsion is a contributor to destabilization of the core domain by addition of the linkers. Thus, the context of Domain 2 within the whole molecule affects its thermodynamic characteristics.",

        "abstract": "With the aim of gaining insight into the molecular and phylogenetic relationships of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) from hyperthermophiles, we carried out a comparative study of putative IDHs identified in the genomes of the eubacterium Thermotoga maritima and the archaea Aeropyrum pernix and Pyrococcus furiosus. An optimum for activity at 90 degrees C or above was found for each IDH. PfIDH and ApIDH were the most thermostable with a melting temperature of 103.7 and 109.9 degrees C, respectively, compared with 98.3 and 98.5 degrees C for TmIDH and AfIDH, respectively. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a tetrameric oligomeric state for TmIDH and a homodimeric state for ApIDH and PfIDH. TmIDH and ApIDH were NADP-dependent (K(m)((NADP)) of 55.2 and 44.4 microm, respectively) whereas PfIDH was NAD-dependent (K(m)((NAD)) of 68.3 microm). These data document that TmIDH represents a novel tetrameric NADP-dependent form of IDH and that PfIDH is a homodimeric NAD-dependent IDH not previously found among the archaea. The homodimeric NADP-IDH present in A. pernix is the most common form of IDH known so far. The evolutionary relationships of ApIDH, PfIDH, and TmIDH with all of the available amino acid sequences of di- and multimeric IDHs are described and discussed.",

The CD spectra for this dicyclic peptide indicate that it is monomeric, almost fully alpha-helical at -10 degrees C, and undergoes a reversible transition from the folded to the disordered state with increasing temperature. The temperature dependencies of the ellipticity at 222 nm and the excess heat capacity measured calorimetrically are well fit by a two-state model, which indicates a cooperative melting transition that is complete within the temperature ranges of these experiments (from -10 degrees C to 100 degrees C). This allows a complete analysis of the thermodynamics of helix formation. The helix unfolding is found to proceed with a small positive heat-capacity increment, consistent with the solvation of some non-polar groups upon helix unfolding. It follows that the hydrogen bonds are not the only factors responsible for the formation of the alpha-helix, and that hydrophobic interactions are also playing a role in its stabilization. At 30 degrees C, the calorimetric enthalpy and entropy values are estimated to be 650(+/-50) cal mol(-1)and 2.0(+/-0.2) cal K(-1)mole(-1), respectively, per residue of this peptide. Comparison with the thermodynamic characteristics obtained for the unfolding of double-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coils shows that at that temperature the enthalpic contribution of non-polar groups to the stabilization of the alpha-helix is insignificant and the estimated transition enthalpy can be assigned to the hydrogen bonds. With increasing temperature, the increasing magnitude of the negative enthalpy of hydration of the exposed polar groups should decrease the helix-stabilizing enthalpy of the backbone hydrogen bonds. However, the helix-stabilizing negative entropy of hydration of these groups should also increase in magnitude with increasing temperature, offsetting this effect.",

        "abstract": "From equilibrium measurements with urea we found a three-state thermodynamic and kinetic folding behavior for the precursor and mature form of Escherichia coli beta-lactamase TEM2. The thermodynamic intermediate H of Escherichia coli beta-lactamase and its precursor had no enzymatic activity, and a quenched tryptophan fluorescence intensity, but a native-like wavelength of maximum intensity. State H of mature beta-lactamase was 8.7 kcal mol-1 less stable than the native state N and about 4.2 kcal mol-1 more stable than the unfolded state U, extrapolated to absence of urea. In contrast, state H of precursor beta-lactamase was even more stable than N by about 0.5 kcal mol-1 and about 6.9 kcal mol-1 more stable than U. Native pre-beta-lactamase could be stabilized by lowering the pH value from 7.0 to 5.5, probably by protonating a histidine residue leading to an improved solubility of the signal sequence. Synthetic peptides, containing 23 or 38 N-terminal amino acid residues of pre-beta-lactamase, were unable to compete with pre-beta-lactamase for binding to GroEL. However, GroEL prevented the inactivation of mature beta-lactamase by p38, consistent with competition between GroEL and mature beta-lactamase for binding to p38. The equilibrium constant for dissociation KD of the complex between GroEL and p23, a peptide containing exclusively the signal sequence of pre-beta-lactamase, was measured with the BIAcore instrument to be in the range 10(-7) to 10(-8) M. Our results are consistent with co-operative binding of GroEL to the mature part and to the signal sequence of pre-beta-lactamase.

        "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine which is involved in a broad spectrum of activities such as immune defense, hematopoiesis, and the acute phase response, as well as in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma. A series of murine IL-6 (mIL-6) mutants, H31A, W34A, and H31A/W34A, were constructed to investigate the roles of His31 and Trp34 in the structure, conformational stability, time-dependent aggregation, folding, and spectral properties of mIL-6. The characteristic pH-dependent quenching of fluorescence of mIL-6 at low pH was shown to be caused by an interaction between Trp34 and protonated His31 at low pH and not associated with Trp157. Denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments monitored by fluorescence and far-UV CD showed that the increased quantum yield and blue shift of the wavelength of the emission maximum observed for mIL-6 at moderate denaturant concentrations were also associated with Trp34, rather than Trp157. The tendency to form aggregation-prone unfolding intermediates, as judged by poor fits to a two-state unfolding mechanism, low m values (slopes of the unfolding curve in the transition region), and the range of denaturant concentrations over which these intermediates formed, was shown to be higher for H31A than mIL-6 but significantly lower for W34A and H31A/W34A. These differences were most pronounced at pH 7.4 and correlated with the tendencies of the proteins to aggregate at high protein concentrations in the absence of denaturant. As judged by the 1H NMR chemical shifts of the aromatic residues, the global conformations of H31A and W34A were not significantly different from that of mIL-6. Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) between the side chains of His31 and Trp34 were consistent with the indole side chain of Trp34 being oriented toward the face of the imidazolium side chain of His31, an arrangement consistent with our estimates of a low interaction energy (0.4-0.6 kcal/mol) between these side chains. A shift in the pKa of the His31 side chain in W34A (+0.3 unit) suggested that, in the absence of Trp34, His31 could interact with other residues. Further mutations in this region should yield forms of mIL-6, even less prone to aggregation, which would be more suitable for NMR studies. Mutation of His31 and Trp34 to alanine did not significantly alter the mitogenic activity of the mutants on mouse hybridoma 7TD1 cells, even though the corresponding region of human IL-6 has been shown to be important for biological activity.",

A set of 431 protein alpha-helices containing a C'-Gly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) was analyzed, and the normalized frequencies for finding particular residues at the Ccap position, the average fraction of buried surface area, and the hydrogen bonding patterns of the Ccap residue side-chain were calculated. We found that on average the Ccap position is 70% buried and noted a significant correlation (R=0.8) between the relative burial of this residue and its hydrophobicity as defined by the Gibbs energy of transfer from octanol or cyclohexane to water. Ccap residues with polar side-chains are commonly involved in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding pattern is such that, the longer side-chains of Glu, Gln, Arg, Lys, His form hydrogen bonds with residues distal (>+/-4) in sequence, while the shorter side-chains of Asp, Asn, Ser, Thr exhibit hydrogen bonds with residues close in sequence (<+/-4), mainly involving backbone atoms. Experimentally we determined the thermodynamic propensities of residues at the Ccap position using the protein ubiquitin as a model system. We observed a large variation in the stability of the ubiquitin variants depending on the nature of the Ccap residue. Furthermore, the measured changes in stability of the ubiquitin variants correlate with the hydrophobicity of the Ccap residue. The experimental results, together with the statistical analysis of protein structures from the PDB, indicate that the key hydrophobic capping interactions between a helical residue (C3 or C4) and a residue outside the helix (C\", C3' or C4') are frequently enhanced by the hydrophobic interactions with Ccap residues.",

        "abstract": "Topological linking of proteins is a new approach for stabilizing and controlling the oligomerization state of proteins that fold in an interwined manner. The recent design of a backbone cyclized protein catenane based on the p53tet domain suggested that topological cross-linking provided increased stability against thermal and chemical denaturation. However, the tetrameric structure complicated detailed biophysical analysis of this protein. Here, we describe the design, synthesis and thermodynamic characterization of a protein catenane based on a dimeric mutant of the p53tet domain (M340E/L344K). The formation of the catenane proceeded efficiently, and the overall structure and oligomerization of the domain was not affected by the formation of the topological link. Unfolding and refolding of the catenane was consistent with a two-state process. The topological link stabilized the dimer against thermal and chemical denaturation considerably, raising the apparent melting temperature by 59 degrees C and the midpoint of denaturation by 4.5M GuHCl at a concentration of 50 microM. The formation of the topological link increased the resistance of the dimer to proteolysis. However, the m value decreased by 1.7kcalmol(-1)M(-1), suggesting a decrease in accessible surface area in the unfolded state. This implies that the stabilization from the topological link is largely due to a destabilization of the unfolded state, similar to other cross-links in proteins. Topological linking therefore provides a powerful and orthogonal tool for the stabilization of peptide and protein oligomers.",

        "abstract": "Subtilisin is an unusual example of a monomeric protein with a substantial kinetic barrier to folding and unfolding. Here we document for the first time the in vitro folding of the mature form of subtilisin. Subtilisin was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to be proteolytically inactive, allowing the impediments to folding to be systematically examined. First, the thermodynamics and kinetics of calcium binding to the high-affinity calcium A-site have been measured by microcalorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. Binding is an enthalpically driven process with an association constant (Ka) equal to 7 x 10(6) M-1. Furthermore, the kinetic barrier to calcium removal from the A-site (23 kcal/mol) is substantially larger than the standard free energy of binding (9.3 kcal/mol). The kinetics of calcium dissociation from subtilisin (e.g., in excess EDTA) are accordingly very slow (t1/2 = 1.3 h at 25 degrees C). Second, to measure the kinetics of subtilisin folding independent of calcium binding, the high-affinity calcium binding site was deleted from the protein. At low ionic strength (I = 0.01) refolding of this mutant requires several days. The folding rate is accelerated almost 100-fold by a 10-fold increase in ionic strength, indicating that part of the free energy of activation may be electrostatic. At relatively high ionic strength (I = 0.5) refolding of the mutant subtilisin is complete in less than 1 h at 25 degrees C. We suggest that part of the electrostatic contribution to the activation free energy for folding subtilisin is related to the highly charged region of the protein comprising the weak ion binding site (site B).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The cis/trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds has been suggested to dominate the folding of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase from Escherichia coli (alphaTS). To test the role of the unique cis isomer between Asp27 and Pro28, the folding properties of P28A, P28G and G(3)P28G, a three-glycine insertion mutant between Asp27 and Gly28, were investigated using urea as a denaturant. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrated that none of the mutations perturb the secondary structure significantly, although the aromatic side-chain packing is altered for P28A and P28G. All three mutant proteins inherited the three-state thermodynamic behavior observed in wild-type alphaTS, ensuring that the fundamental features of the energy surface are intact. Kinetic studies showed that neither alanine nor glycine substitutions at Pro28 results in the elimination of any slow-refolding phases. By contrast, the G(3)P28G mutant eliminates the fastest of the slow-refolding phases and one of the two unfolding phases. Double-jump experiments on G(3)P28G confirm the assignment of the missing refolding phase to the isomerization of the Asp27-Pro28 peptide bond. These results imply that the local stability conveyed by the tight, overlapping turns containing the cis peptide bond is sufficient to favor the cis isomer for several non-prolyl residues. The free energy required to drive the isomerization reaction is provided by the formation of the stable intermediate, demonstrating that the acquisition of structure and stability is required to induce subsequent rate-limiting steps in the folding of alphaTS.",

        "abstract": "To investigate whether the structure partially formed in the molten globule folding intermediate of goat alpha-lactalbumin is further organized in the transition state of folding, we constructed a number of mutant proteins and performed Phi-value analysis on them. For this purpose, we measured the equilibrium unfolding transitions and kinetic refolding and unfolding reactions of the mutants using equilibrium and stopped-flow kinetic circular dichroism techniques. The results show that the mutants with mutations located in the A-helix (V8A, L12A), the B-helix (V27A), the beta-domain (L52A, W60A), the C-helix (K93A, L96A), the C-D loop (Y103F), the D-helix (L105A, L110A), and the C-terminal 3(10)-helix (W118F), have low Phi-values, less than 0.2. On the other hand, D87N, which is located on the Ca(2+)-binding site, has a high Phi-value, 0.91, indicating that tight packing of the side-chain around Asp87 occurs in the transition state. One beta-domain mutant (I55V) and three C-helix mutants (I89V, V90A, and I95V) demonstrated intermediate Phi-values, between 0.4 and 0.7. These results indicate that the folding nucleus in the transition state of goat alpha-LA is not extensively distributed over the alpha-domain of the protein, but very localized in a region that contains the Ca(2+)-binding site and the interface between the C-helix and the beta-domain. This is apparently in contrast with the fact that the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin has a partially formed structure inside the alpha-domain. It is concluded that the specific docking of the alpha and beta-domains at a domain interface is necessary for this protein to organize its native structure from the molten globule intermediate.",

Although both faces of the hairpin are formed mainly by hydrophilic residues, one of them is uncharged while the other has a characteristic pattern of charged residues which are highly conserved among vertebrate species. Chemical shift indexing and relaxation data indicate the presence of a collapsed hydrophobic region next to the hairpin that includes approximately 30 residues with slower concerted motion and higher content of nonpolar residues and, according to a previous study (Tsurupa, G., Tsonev, L., and Medved, L. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 6449-6459), may cooperate with the hairpin to form a compact cooperative unit (domain). Structure and relaxation data show that the region between C423 and C453 is populated by both random coil and beta-structure, suggesting that the cooperative structure in the isolated alphaC-domain is intrinsically unstable. This observation is in agreement with a very low energy of stabilization of the Aalpha374-538 fragment determined in unfolding experiments. The low stability of the alphaC-domain suggests a possible explanation for the previously observed intra- and intermolecular interactions of these domains in fibrinogen and fibrin.",

        "abstract": "Canonical glutathione (GSH) transferases are dimeric proteins with subunits composed of an N-terminal GSH binding region (domain 1) and a C-terminal helical region (domain 2). The stabilities of several GSH transferase dimers are dependent upon two groups of interactions between domains 1 and 2 of opposing subunits: a hydrophobic ball-and-socket motif and a buried charge cluster motif. In rGSTM1-1, these motifs involve residues F56 and R81, respectively. The structural basis for the effects of mutating F56 to different residues on dimer stability and function has been reported (Codreanu et al. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 10605-10612). Here, we show that the simultaneous disruption of both motifs in the F56S/R81A mutant causes complete dissociation of the dimer to a monomeric protein on the basis of gel filtration chromatography and multiple-angle laser light scattering. The fluorescence and far-UV CD properties of the double mutant as well as the kinetics of amide H/D exchange along the polypeptide backbone suggest that the monomer has a globular structure that is similar to a single subunit in the native protein. However, the mutant monomer has severely impaired catalytic activity, suggesting that the dimer interface is vital for efficient catalysis. Backbone amide H/D exchange kinetics in the F56S and F56S/R81A mutants indicate that a reorganization of the loop structure between helix alpha2 and strand beta3 near the active site is responsible for the decreased catalytic activity of the monomer. In addition, the junction between the alpha4 and alpha5 helices in F56S/R81R shows decreased H/D exchange, indicating another structural change that may affect catalysis. Although the native subunit interface is important for dimer stability, urea-induced unfolding of the F56S/R81A mutant suggests that the interface is not essential for the thermodynamic stability of individual subunits. The H/D exchange data reveal a possible molecular basis for the folding cooperativity observed between domains 1 and 2.",

M., Wright, P. E., & Baldwin, R. L. (1990) Science 249, 1544-1548]. Because A, G, and H form a compact subdomain in native myoglobin, we proposed that nativelike packing interactions among the three helices might be retained in the I form of apomyoglobin. To test this proposal, disruptive mutations were introduced into the A.H and G.H helix packing sites. These mutations destabilize native apomyoglobin relative to I. In contrast, the stability of I is relatively insensitive to mutation; in particular, side-chain volume alone does not appear to be important. These results indicate that the I form is not stabilized by nativelike A.H and G.H packing interactions. In support of this we show that partly helical peptides derived from the G and H helix regions of myoglobin do not pair in solution. Since the isolated G and H peptides are at best only partly helical, some type of interaction must stabilize these helices in the I form. Small increases in the stability of I are seen when mutation introduces a side chain of increased nonpolar surface area. We suggest that I is stabilized by relatively nonspecific hydrophobic interactions that allow it to adapt easily to mutation. In this and other respects, I appears to conform to the \"molten globule\" model, with the caveat that only part of the polypeptide chain appears to participate in the globule.",

To investigate these forces we introduced alanine substitutions at 24 positions in the B helix of bacteriorhodopsin and examined their effects on structure and stability.

(1) We find a remarkably high frequency of stabilizing mutations (17%), indicating that membrane proteins are not highly optimized for stability. (2) Helix B is kinked, with the kink centered around Pro50. The P50A mutation has no effect on stability, however, and a crystal structure reveals that the helix remains bent, indicating that tertiary contacts dominate in the distortion of this helix. (3) We find that the protein is stabilized by about 1kcal/mol for every 38A(2) of surface area buried, which is quite similar to soluble proteins in spite of their dramatically different environments. (4) We find little energetic difference, on average, in the burial of apolar surface or polar surface area, implying that van der Waals packing is the dominant force that drives membrane protein folding.",

        "abstract": "The thermodynamics of the native<-->A state and native<-->unfolded transitions for ubiquitin have been characterized in detail using the denaturants methanol and guanidinium chloride (Gdn.HCl) both separately and in combination. Gdn.HCl destabilizes the partially folded alcohol-induced A state such that the effects of alcoholic solvents on the native<-->unfolded transition can be investigated directly via a two-state model. The combined denaturing effects of methanol and Gdn.HCl appear to conform to a simple additive model. We show that ubiquitin folds and unfolds cooperatively in all cases, forming the same \"native\" state; however, the thermodynamics of the N<-->U transition change dramatically between alcoholic and Gdn.HCl solutions, with folding in aqueous methanol associated with large negative enthalpy and entropy terms at 298 K with a gradual falloff in DeltaC(p) at higher methanol concentrations, as previously reported for the N<-->A transition (Woolfson, D. N., Cooper, A., Harding, M. M., Williams, D. H., and Evans, P. A. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 229, 502-511.). Both the N<-->U and the N<-->A transitions are enthalpy driven to a similar extent. We conclude that under these conditions van der Waals interactions in the packing of the nonpolar protein core, which is common to both the N<-->U and the N<-->A transitions, appear to drive folding in the absence of entropic effects associated with release of ordered solvent (hydrophobic effect). Solvent transfer studies of hydrocarbons into alcoholic solvents, with and without Gdn.HCl, are consistent with a large enthalpic driving force for burial of a nonpolar surface, with a linear dependence of protein stability (DeltaG(N)(<-->)(U)) on cosolvent concentration reflected in a similar linear dependence of hydrocarbon solubility. The data demonstrate that the hydrophobic effect is not a prerequisite for specific stabilization of the native state or the A state and that van der Waals packing of the nonpolar core appears to be the dominant factor in stabilization of the native state.",

        "abstract": "It is generally considered that electrostatic interactions on the protein surface, such as ion pairs, contribute little to protein stability, although they may play important roles in conformational specificity. We found that the tenth fibronectin type III domain of human fibronectin (FNfn10) is more stable at acidic pH than neutral pH, with an apparent midpoint of transition near pH 4. Determination of pK(a)'s for all the side chain carboxyl groups of Asp and Glu residues revealed that Asp 23 and Glu 9 have an upshifted pK(a). These residues and Asp 7 form a negatively charged patch on the surface of FNfn10, with Asp 7 centrally located between Asp 23 and Glu 9, suggesting repulsive electrostatic interactions among these residues at neutral pH. Mutant proteins, D7N and D7K, in which Asp 7 was replaced with Asn and Lys, respectively, exhibited a modest but significant increase in stability at neutral pH, compared to the wild type, and they no longer showed pH dependence of stability. The pK(a)'s of Asp 23 and Glu 9 in these mutant proteins shifted closer to their respective unperturbed values, indicating that the unfavorable electrostatic interactions have been reduced in the mutant proteins. Interestingly, the wild-type and mutant proteins were all stabilized to a similar degree by the addition of 1 M sodium chloride at both neutral and acidic pH, suggesting that the repulsive interactions between the carboxyl groups cannot be effectively shielded by 1 M sodium chloride. These results indicate that repulsive interactions between like charges on the protein surface can destabilize a protein, and protein stability can be significantly improved by relieving these interactions.",

J. Phys. Chem. 99:14864-14870). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace both cysteines for alanines. The characterization of the Cys-3Ala/Cys-26Ala azurin mutant has been carried out by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at 77 K, UV-VIS optical absorption, fluorescence emission and circular dichroism at room temperature. The results show that the spectral features of the Cys-3Ala/Cys-26Ala azurin resemble those of the wild type azurin, indicating that the double mutation does not affect either the formation of the protein's overall structure or the assembly of the metal-binding site. The thermal unfolding of the Cys-3Ala/Cys-26Ala azurin has been followed by differential scanning calorimetry, optical absorption variation at lambda(max) = 625 nm, and fluorescence emission using 295 nm as excitation wavelength. The analysis of the data shows that the thermal transition from the native to the denaturated state of the modified azurin follows the same multistep unfolding pathway as observed in wild type azurin. However, the removal of the disulfide bridge results in a dramatic reduction of the thermodynamic stability of the protein. In fact, the transition temperatures registered by the different techniques are down-shifted by about 20 degrees C with respect to wild type azurin. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy value is about half of that found for the native azurin. These results suggest that the disulfide bridge is a structural element that significantly contributes to the high stability of wild type azurin.",

In contrast, at pH 2 the L-ferritin subunit showed two calorimetric domains with Tm of 35 and 40 degrees C with similar unfolding enthalpies and with moderate extent of interactions, as indicated by the ratio of calorimetric enthalpy (293.9 kJ/mol) and van't Hoff enthalpy (174.2 kJ/mol) for the thermal transition. A pH increase from 2.0 to 2.8 determined the coupling of the two domains into a single cooperative folding unit and drastic increase of the transition temperature (from 37 to 80 degrees C). The contacts between the two domains in the L-subunit appeared to contribute to about 30% of the total stabilization free energy. The unfolding enthalpies, heat capacity changes and pronounced ANS binding of the L-subunit at pH 2.0-2.8 indicated that part of the structure lacked 'meltable' tertiary interactions. The results indicate that H- and L-subunits are stabilized by largely different intra-chain interactions with a critical contribution to L-subunit stability of embedded salt bridge(s) absent in the H-subunit.",

        "abstract": "Human acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) is a powerful mitogen and angiogenic factor with an apparent melting temperature (Tm) in the physiological range. FGF-1 is an example of a protein that is regulated, in part, by stability-based mechanisms. For example, the low Tm of FGF-1 has been postulated to play an important role in the unusual endoplasmic reticulum-independent secretion of this growth factor. Despite the close relationship between function and stability, accurate thermodynamic parameters of unfolding for FGF-1 have been unavailable, presumably due to effects of irreversible thermal denaturation. Here we report the determination of thermodynamic parameters of unfolding (DeltaH, DeltaG, and DeltaCp) for FGF-1 using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal denaturation is demonstrated to be two-state and reversible upon the addition of low concentrations of added guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl). DeltaG values from the DSC studies are in excellent agreement with values from isothermal GuHCl denaturation monitored by fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Furthermore, the results indicate that irreversible denaturation is closely associated with the formation of an unfolding intermediate. GuHCl appears to promote reversible two-state denaturation by initially preventing aggregation of this unfolding intermediate, and at subsequently higher concentrations, by preventing formation of the intermediate.",

        "abstract": "Thermally induced denaturation has been measured for both oxidised and reduced forms of the tryptic fragment of bovine microsomal cytochrome b5 using spectrophotometric methods. In the oxidised state, the tryptic fragment of cytochrome b5 (Ala7-Lys90) denatures in a single cooperative transition with a midpoint temperature (Tm) of approximately 67 degrees C (pH 7.0). The reduced form of the tryptic fragment of cytochrome b5 shows a higher transition temperature of approximately 73 degrees C at pH 7.0 and this is reflected in the values of delta Hm, delta Sm and delta(delta G) of approximately 310kJ.mol-1, 900J.mol-1.K-1 and 5 kJ.mol-1. Increased thermal stability is demonstrated for a variant protein that contains the first 90 amino acid residues of cytochrome b5. These novel increases in stability are observed in both redox states and result from the presence of six additional residues at the amino-terminus. The two forms of cytochrome b5 do not differ significantly in structure with the results suggesting that the reorganisation energy (lambda) of the variant protein, as measured indirectly from redox-linked differences in conformational stability, is small. Consequently the reported subtle differences in reactivity between variants of cytochrome b5 may result from the presence of additional N-terminal residues on the surface of the protein.",

The enzyme was shown to bind 3-4 Ca(2+) ions, which all are important for its activity. In contrast to other alpha-amylases no inhibition was observed at high Ca(2+) concentrations (100 mM). Depletion of calcium decreased the transition temperature from 87 to 48 degrees C. Kinetic stopped-flow fluorescence measurements allowed detecting two unfolding phases at >6 M GdmCl, whereas only one phase was observed at <5 M GdmCl.

CD and fluorescence studies indicated that when incubated with sugar, the denatured BLG is refolded into the native-like structure through the dilution additive mode resulting in a higher yield of active protein than without sugar. CD studies show that these sugars can induce a non-native alpha-helical structure in denatured BLG-A and -B, then aid in the refolding of the protein. Based on the present study, these sugars have a different effect on BLG-A than BLG-B because of their differences in protein thermal stability.

Previously, we evaluated the contributions of individual domains to the thermostability of EF-Tu from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus. We showed that domain 1 (G-domain) sets up the basal level of thermostability for the whole protein. Here we chose to locate the thermostability determinants distinguishing the thermophilic domain 1 from a mesophilic domain 1. By an approach of systematically swapping protein regions differing between G-domains from mesophilic Bacillus subtilis and thermophilic B. stearothermophilus, we demonstrate that a small portion of the protein, the N-terminal 12 amino acid residues, plays a key role in the thermostability of this domain. We suggest that the thermostabilizing effect of the N-terminal region could be mediated by stabilizing the functionally important effector region. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of the N-terminal region is significant also for the thermostability of the full-length EF-Tu.",

        "title": "Folding of horse cytochrome c in the reduced state.", 
        "abstract": "Equilibrium and kinetic folding studies of horse cytochrome c in the reduced state have been carried out under strictly anaerobic conditions at neutral pH, 10 degrees C, in the entire range of aqueous solubility of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Equilibrium unfolding transitions observed by Soret heme absorbance, excitation energy transfer from the lone tryptophan residue to the ferrous heme, and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) are all biphasic and superimposable, implying no accumulation of structural intermediates. The thermodynamic parameters obtained by two-state analysis of these transitions yielded DeltaG(H2O)=18.8(+/-1.45) kcal mol(-1), and C(m)=5.1(+/-0.15) M GdnHCl, indicating unusual stability of reduced cytochrome c. These results have been used in conjunction with the redox potential of native cytochrome c and the known stability of oxidized cytochrome c to estimate a value of -164 mV as the redox potential of the unfolded protein. Stopped-flow kinetics of folding and unfolding have been recorded by Soret heme absorbance, and tryptophan fluorescence as observables. The refolding kinetics are monophasic in the transition region, but become biphasic as moderate to strongly native-like conditions are approached. There also is a burst folding reaction unobservable in the stopped-flow time window. Analyses of the two observable rates and their amplitudes indicate that the faster of the two rates corresponds to apparent two-state folding (U<-->N) of 80-90 % of unfolded molecules with a time constant in the range 190-550 micros estimated by linear extrapolation and model calculations. The remaining 10-20 % of the population folds to an off-pathway intermediate, I, which is required to unfold first to the initial unfolded state, U, in order to refold correctly to the native state, N (I<-->U<-->N). The slower of the two observable rates, which has a positive slope in the linear functional dependence on the denaturant concentration indicating that an unfolding process under native-like conditions indeed exists, originates from the unfolding of I to U, which rate-limits the overall folding of these 10-20 % of molecules. Both fast and slow rates are independent of protein concentration and pH of the refolding milieu, suggesting that the off-pathway intermediate is not a protein aggregate or trapped by heme misligation. The nature or type of unfolded-state heme ligation does not interfere with refolding. Equilibrium pH titration of the unfolded state yielded coupled ionization of the two non-native histidine ligands, H26 and H33, with a pK(a) value of 5.85. A substantial fraction of the unfolded population persists as the six-coordinate form even at low pH, suggesting ligation of the two methionine residues, M65 and M80. These results have been used along with the known ligand-binding properties of unfolded cytochrome c to propose a model for heme ligation dynamics. In contrast to refolding kinetics, the unfolding kinetics of reduced cytochrome c recorded by observation of Soret absorbance and tryptophan fluorescence are all slow, simple, and single-exponential. In the presence of 6.8 M GdnHCl, the unfolding time constant is approximately 300(+/-125) ms. There is no burst unfolding reaction. Simulations of the observed folding-unfolding kinetics by numerical solutions of the rate equations corresponding to the three-state I<-->U<-->N scheme have yielded the microscopic rate constants.",

        "abstract": "Chemical and thermal denaturation of calmodulin has been monitored spectroscopically to determine the stability for the intact protein and its two isolated domains as a function of binding of Ca2+ or Mg2+. The reversible urea unfolding of either isolated apo-domain follows a two-state mechanism with relatively low deltaG(o)20 values of approximately 2.7 (N-domain) and approximately 1.9 kcal/mol (C-domain). The apo-C-domain is significantly unfolded at normal temperatures (20-25 degrees C). The greater affinity of the C-domain for Ca2+ causes it to be more stable than the N-domain at [Ca2+] > or = 0.3 mM. By contrast, Mg2+ causes a greater stabilization of the N- rather than the C-domain, consistent with measured Mg2+ affinities. For the intact protein (+/-Ca2+), the bimodal denaturation profiles can be analyzed to give two deltaG(o)20 values, which differ significantly from those of the isolated domains, with one domain being less stable and one domain more stable. The observed stability of the domains is strongly dependent on solution conditions such as ionic strength, as well as specific effects due to metal ion binding. In the intact protein, different folding intermediates are observed, depending on the ionic composition. The results illustrate that a protein of low intrinsic stability is liable to major perturbation of its unfolding properties by environmental conditions and liganding processes and, by extension, mutation. Hence, the observed stability of an isolated domain may differ significantly from the stability of the same structure in a multidomain protein. These results address questions involved in manipulating the stability of a protein or its domains by site directed mutagenesis and protein engineering.",

        "abstract": "The apomyoglobin molten globule has a complex, partly folded structure with a folded A[B]GH subdomain; the factors determining its stability are not yet known in detail. Ala-->Gly mutations, made at solvent-exposed positions, are used to probe the role of helix propensity of individual helices in stabilizing the molten globule. Molten globule stability is measured by reversible urea unfolding, monitored both by circular dichroism and by tryptophan fluorescence. Two-state unfolding is tested by superposition of these two unfolding curves, and stability data are reported only for variants which satisfy the superposition test. Results for sites Q8 in the A helix and E109 in the G helix confirm that the helix propensities of the A and G helices both strongly affect molten globule stability, in contrast to results for the G65A/G73A double mutant which show that changing the helix propensity of the E-helix sequence has no significant stabilizing effect. Changing the helix propensity of the B-helix sequence with the G23A/G25A double mutant affects molten globule stability to an intermediate extent, confirming an earlier report that this mutant has increased stability. These results are consistent with the bipartite structure for the molten globule in which the A, G, and H helices are stably folded, while the long E helix is unfolded and the B helix has intermediate stability. Some differences are found in the shapes of the unfolding curves of different mutants even though they satisfy the superposition test for two-state unfolding, and possible explanations are discussed.",

We compared the stability of the native and acidic molten globule states of horse ferricytochrome c against heat, urea and guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) using the intact species and species modified by various degrees of acetylation of the lysyl epsilon-amino groups. After acetylation, the amino groups cannot protonate at acidic pH. Thermal and urea-induced unfolding transitions measured by far-UV circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry showed that, whereas acetylation stabilizes the molten globule state at pH 2, it destabilizes the native state at pH 7, suggesting a difference in their mechanisms of conformational stability. On the other hand, the effects of Gdn-Hcl were remarkable. Contrary to what was expected from the thermal and urea-induced unfolding transitions, the Gdn-HCl-induced unfolding transition of the native state at pH 7 was insensitive to the extent of acetylation. At pH 2, Gdn-HCl at low concentrations stabilized the molten globule state and, at high concentrations, destabilized it. Consideration of the difference in the effects of Gdn-HCl from those of urea or heat indicated that, whereas the net positive charge repulsion destabilizes the molten globule state at pH 2, the local negative charge repulsion produced by acetylation of amino groups, and not the net charge, critically destabilizes the native state at pH 7. These results predict that, because of its ionic nature, Gdn-HCl will produce substantially different effects on the conformational states of some proteins compared with those of urea.",

The linear dependence of folding rates on denaturant concentration and the lack of an unaccounted \"burst-phase\" change for the fluorescence signal indicate that a two-state folding model is adequate to describe the folding pathway. This behavior also is seen for folding in the presence of the stabilizing additives 0.23 M sodium sulfate and 1 M sodium chloride.

        "abstract": "The binding of the multidomain protein factor VIIa (fVIIa) to tissue factor provides the interprotein communication necessary to make fVIIa an efficient catalyst of the initial event in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. We have investigated the stability of individual domains in fVIIa and the influence of Ca2+ and an irreversible active-site inhibitor (FFR-chloromethyl ketone). Equilibrium guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl)-induced unfolding monitored by tryptophan fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) demonstrated that the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain unfolds at 0.3 M GuHCl and the serine protease (SP) domain at 3 M GuHCl and that Ca2+ is a prerequisite for the formation of an ordered, compact structure in the Gla domain. The loss of amidolytic activity coincides with the first transition, which is stabilized by the active-site inhibitor, and a change in the environment of the active site is demonstrated using a fluorescent inhibitor (DEGR-chloromethyl ketone). Thermal unfolding monitored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) reveals that Ca2+ stabilizes the SP domain slightly, increasing the unfolding temperature by 2.7 degrees C. In addition, Ca2+ is required for a large enthalpy change concomitant with unfolding of the Gla domain, and this unfolding enthalpy is only detectable in the presence of the SP domain, indicating some kind of interaction between these domains. Thermal unfolding measured by CD indicates secondary structural changes at the same temperature as the heat absorption in the DSC but only when both the Gla domain and the SP domain are present together with Ca2+ ions. Taken together, these results indicate a Ca2+-dependent interaction between the Gla domain and the SP domain, implying a high degree of flexibility of the domains in free fVIIa. It is also shown that the epidermal growth factor-like domains are stable at elevated temperatures and high GuHCl concentrations. Moreover, already at physiological temperature, subtle structural changes take place which influence the overall shape of fVIIa and are detrimental to its enzymatic activity.",

        "abstract": "Ligand-induced conformation change is a general strategy for controlling protein function. In this work, we demonstrate the relationships between ligand binding and conformational stability using a previously designed protein, Ant-F, which undergoes a conformation change upon Zn(II) binding. To investigate the effect of stabilization of the apo structure on the conformation change, we also created a novel protein, Ant-F-H1, into which mutations are introduced to increase its stability over that of Ant-F. The chemical denaturation experiments clarified that apo-Ant-F-H1 is more stable than apo-Ant-F (DeltaDeltaG = -1.28 kcal/mol) and that the stability of holo-Ant-F-H1 is almost the same as that of holo-Ant-F. The Zn(II) binding assay shows that the affinity of Zn(II) for Ant-F-H1 is weaker than that for Ant-F (DeltaDeltaG = 1.40 kcal/mol). A large part of the increased value of free energy in stability corresponds to the decreased value of free energy in Zn(II) binding, indicating that the stability of the apo structure directly affects the conformation change. The denaturation experiments also reveal that Zn(II) destabilizes the conformation of both proteins. From the thermodynamic linkage, Zn(II) is thought to bind to the unfolded state with high affinity. These results suggest that the binding of Zn(II) to the unfolded state is an important factor in the conformational change as well as the stability of the apo and holo structures.",

The refolding rates of small proteins that fold without intermediates are found to correlate with simple structural parameters such as relative contact order, long-range order, or the fraction of short-range contacts. To test and evaluate the role of structural topology experimentally, a set of circular permutants of the ribosomal protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus was analyzed. Despite a wide range of relative contact order, the permuted proteins all fold with similar rates. These results suggest that alternative topological parameters may better describe the role of topology in protein-folding rates.",

        "abstract": "Thermostabilization of enzymes is one of the greatest challenges of protein engineering. The ancestral mutation method, which introduces ancestral residues into a target enzyme, has previously been developed and used to improve the thermostabilities of thermophilic enzymes. Herein, we report a study that used the ancestral mutation method to improve the thermostability of Bacillus circulans beta-amylase, a mesophilic enzyme. A bacterial, common-ancestral beta-amylase sequence was inferred using a phylogenetic tree composed of higher plant and bacterial amylase sequences. Eighteen mutants containing ancestral residues were designed, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Several of these mutants were more thermostable than that of the wild-type amylase. Notably, one mutant had both greater activity and greater thermostability. The relationship between the extent to which the amino acid residues within 5 A of the mutation site were evolutionarily conserved and the extent to which thermostability was improved was examined. Apparently, it is necessary to conserve the residues surrounding an ancestral residue if thermostability is to be improved by the ancestral mutation method.",

        "abstract": "The landscape paradigm of protein folding can enable preferred pathways on a funnel-like energy surface. Hierarchical preferences may be manifest as a nonrandom pathway of disulfide pairing. Stepwise stabilization of structural subdomains among on-pathway intermediates is proposed to underlie the disulfide pathway of proinsulin and related molecules. Here, effects of pairwise serine substitution of insulin's exposed interchain disulfide bridge (Cys(A7)-Cys(B7)) are characterized as a model of a late intermediate. Untethering cystine A7-B7 in an engineered monomer causes significantly more marked decreases in the thermodynamic stability and extent of folding than occur on pairwise substitution of internal cystine A6-A11 [Weiss, M. A., Hua, Q. X., Jia, W., Chu, Y. C., Wang, R. Y., and Katsoyannis, P. G. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 15429-15440]. Although substantially disordered and without significant biological activity, the untethered analogue contains a molten subdomain comprising cystine A20-B19 and a native-like cluster of hydrophobic side chains. Remarkably, A and B chains make unequal contributions to this folded moiety; the B chain retains native-like supersecondary structure, whereas the A chain is largely disordered. These observations suggest that the B subdomain provides a template to guide folding of the A chain. Stepwise organization of insulin-like molecules supports a hierarchic view of protein folding.",

        "abstract": "The structural stability of an amino acid fragment containing the oligomerization domain (residues 303-366) of the tumor suppressor p53 has been studied using high-precision differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). Previous NMR solution structural determinations have revealed that the fragment forms a symmetric 29.8 kDa tetramer composed of a dimer of dimers (p53tet) [Lee, W., Harvey, T. S., Yin, Y., Yau, P., Litchfield, D., & Arrowsmith, C. H. (1994) Nature Struct. Biol. 1, 877-890]. Thermal unfolding of the tetramer is reversible and can be described as a two-state transition in which the folded tetramer is converted directly to unfolded monomers (N4<==>4U). According to the DSC and CD data, the population of intermediate species consisting of folded monomers or dimers is insignificant, indicating that isolated dimeric or monomeric structures have a much lower stability than the dimer and do not become populated during thermal denaturation under the conditions studied. The transition temperature of unfolding is found to be highly dependent on protein concentration and to follow the expected behavior for a tetramer that dissociates upon unfolding. Experiments conducted at pH 4.0 in 25 mM sodium acetate at a tetramer concentration of 145.8 microM have a transition temperature (Tm) of 75.3 degrees C while at 0.5 microM the value drops to 39.2 degrees C. The enthalpy change of unfolding at 60 degrees C is 26 kcal (mol of monomer)-1 with a heat capacity change of 387 cal (K.mol of monomer)-1. The stability of p53tet is dependent on pH and salt concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "The sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain is a protein module of approximately 65 to 70 amino acids found in many diverse proteins whose functions range from signal transduction to transcriptional repression. The alpha splice variant of p73 (p73 alpha), a homologue of the tumor suppressor p53, has close to its C-terminus a SAM motif. Here, we report the folding equilibrium properties of the p73 alpha SAM domain (SAMp73) by using different biophysical techniques (circular dichroism, fluorescence, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies, and differential scanning calorimetry). Those probes indicate that SAMp73 folds via a two-state mechanism. Fluorescence experiments performed at different pHs showed two titrations: the first one due to an acid residue (with a pK(a) = 4.5 +/- 0.3) and the second due to deprotonation of tyrosine residues. The conformational stability of the protein upon chemical denaturation was determined over the pH range 3 to 10. The maximum conformational stability is DeltaG = 5.7 +/- 0.4 kcal x mol(-1) (at 25 degrees C) and occurs in a broad maximum, with little variation, between pH 6 and 10. The high melting temperature of SAMp73 (T(m) = 93.5 degrees C), despite its moderate conformational stability at 25 degrees C, can be ascribed to its low heat capacity change upon unfolding, DeltaC(p), which is estimated to be around 915 cal x K(-1) x mol(-1) at 25 degrees C and only around 543 cal x K(-1) x mol(-1) at the T(m). The implications of the temperature-dependent nature of DeltaC(p) are discussed in relation to the thermal stability of proteins as opposed to their conformational stability at room temperature.",

We demonstrate here that the affinity of subunit interaction depends also on the solvent-exposed residues at positions 128 and 179'-184', which interact across the dimerization surface. TetR(B) and (D), two naturally occurring sequence variants, differ at position 128 with respect to the monomer-monomer distances in the crystal structures and the charge of the amino acids, being glutamate in TetR(B) and arginine in TetR(D). In vivo analysis of chimeric TetR(B/D) variants revealed that the single E128R exchange does not alter the dimerization specificity of TetR(B) to the one of TetR(D). When combined with specificity mutations in alpha10, it is, however, able to increase dimerization efficiency of the TetR(B/D) chimera with TetR(D). A loss of contact analysis revealed a positive interaction between Arg-128 and residues located at positions 179'-184' of the second monomer. We constructed a hyperstable TetR(B) variant by replacing residues 128 and 179-184 by the respective TetR(D) sequence. These results establish that in addition to a region in the hydrophobic core residues at the solvent-exposed periphery of the dimerization surface participate in protein-protein recognition in the TetR four-helix bundle.",

        "abstract": "Charge-charge interactions on the surface of native proteins are important for protein stability and can be computationally redesigned in a rational way to modulate protein stability. Such computational effort led to an engineered protein, CspB-TB that has the same core as the mesophilic cold shock protein CspB-Bs from Bacillus subtilis, but optimized distribution of charge-charge interactions on the surface. The CspB-TB protein shows an increase in the transition temperature by 20 degrees C relative to the unfolding temperature of CspB-Bs. The CspB-TB and CspB-Bs protein pair offers a unique opportunity to further explore the energetics of charge-charge interactions as the substitutions at the same sequence positions are done in largely similar structural but different electrostatic environments. In particular we addressed two questions. What is the contribution of charge-charge interactions in the unfolded state to the protein stability and how amino acid substitutions modulate the effect of increase in ionic strength on protein stability (i.e. protein halophilicity). To this end, we experimentally measured the stabilities of over 100 variants of CspB-TB and CspB-Bs proteins with substitutions at charged residues. We also performed computational modeling of these protein variants. Analysis of the experimental and computational data allowed us to conclude that the charge-charge interactions in the unfolded state of two model proteins CspB-Bs and CspB-TB are not very significant and computational models that are based only on the native state structure can adequately, i.e. qualitatively (stabilizing versus destabilizing) and semi-quantitatively (relative rank order), predict the effects of surface charge neutralization or reversal on protein stability. We also show that the effect of ionic strength on protein stability (protein halophilicity) appears to be mainly due to the screening of the long-range charge-charge interactions.",

Here, using a native-state hydrogen exchange method, we directly detected an intermediate with the N-terminal helix unfolded in a mutant (Y925E) of the FAT domain. In addition, kinetic folding studies on the FAT domain suggest that this intermediate exists on the native side of the rate-limiting transition state for folding.

It has been observed (1) that chlorides of Na, K, Cs, and Rb do not affect the native conformation of proteins, (2) that GdnHCl-induced denaturations of proteins in presence and absence of sodium bromide, sodium perchlorate and salts of lithium and calcium are reversible, (3) that optical properties of the GdnHCl-denatured state of proteins remain unchanged in presence of the second denaturant, (4) Cm decreases with an increase in the denaturant concentration, and (5) that except for GdnHCl there exist one or more binding sites on the native proteins for the denaturants.",

The synthesized model coiled-coil (EK), denoted by amino acid residues in positions e and g, which contains only interhelical ionic interactions without any possible (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4) intrahelical ionic interaction, consists of two identical 35 residue polypeptide chains with a heptad repeat KgLaG-bAcLdEeKf. Three mutant coiled-coils were prepared where five Glu residues at e positions in EK were mutated to Gln residues (QK); five Lys residues at g positions were altered to Gln residues (EQ) or these mutations were effected at both positions e and g (QQ). The stabilities of the four coiled-coils were determined by measuring the ellipticities at 220 nm as a function of urea concentration at 20 degrees C. By using a double-mutant cycle analysis it was possible to isolate the energetic contribution of interhelical ionic attractions to coiled-coil stability from the other contributions such as helical preference and hydrophobicity. The 0.37 +/- 0.01 kcal/mol of energetic contribution of one interhelical ion pair to the coiled-coil stability was obtained from three independent comparisons. This findings suggests that a large number of weak interhelical electrostatic interactions on the surface of a protein can make a substantial contribution to protein stability. In addition, the energetic contributions of a single mutation E(-)-->Q, K(+)-->Q, Q-->E degrees and E(-)-->E degrees were also determined (delta delta G = 0.22, 0.26, and 0.46 and 0.65 kcal/mol for the single mutations, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Packing interactions in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme were explored by determining the structural and thermodynamic effects of substitutions for Ala98 and neighboring residues. Ala98 is buried in the core of T4 lysozyme in the interface between two alpha-helices. The Ala98 to Val (A98V) replacement is a temperature-sensitive lesion that lowers the denaturation temperature of the protein by 15 degrees C (pH 3.0, delta delta G = -4.9 kcal/mol) and causes atoms within the two helices to move apart by up to 0.7 A. Additional structural shifts also occur throughout the C-terminal domain. In an attempt to compensate for the A98V replacement, substitutions were made for Val149 and Thr152, which make contact with residue 98. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct the multiple mutants A98V/T152S, A98V/V149C/T152S and the control mutants T152S, V149C and A98V/V149I/T152S. These proteins were crystallized, and their high-resolution X-ray crystal structures were determined. None of the second-site substitutions completely alleviates the destabilization or the structural changes caused by A98V. The changes in stability caused by the different mutations are not additive, reflecting both direct interactions between the sites and structural differences among the mutants. As an example, when Thr152 in wild-type lysozyme is replaced with serine, the protein is destabilized by 2.6 kcal/mol. Except for a small movement of Val94 toward the cavity created by removal of the methyl group, the structure of the T152S mutant is very similar to wild-type T4 lysozyme. In contrast, the same Thr152 to Ser replacement in the A98V background causes almost no change in stability. Although the structure of A98V/T152S remains similar to A98V, the combination of T152S with A98V allows relaxation of some of the strain introduced by the Ala98 to Val replacement. These studies show that removal of methyl groups by mutation can be stabilizing (Val98----Ala), neutral (Thr152----Ser in A98V) or destabilizing (Val149----Cys, Thr152----Ser). Such diverse thermodynamic effects are not accounted for by changes in buried surface area or free energies of transfer of wild-type and mutant side-chains. In general, the changes in protein stability caused by a mutation depend not only on changes in the free energy of transfer associated with the substitution, but also on the structural context within which the mutation occurs and on the ability of the surrounding structure to relax in response to the substitution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

We have shown previously [Lentz, B. R., Wu, J. R., Sorrentino, A. M., & Carleton, J. A. (1991) Biophys. J. 60, 70] that binding to PS/POPC (25/75) large unilamellar vesicles resulted in an enthalpy loss in the main endotherm of prothrombin denaturation (Tm approximately 57-58 degrees C) and a comparable enthalpy gain in a minor endotherm (Tm approximately 59 degrees C) accompanying an upward shift in peak temperature (Tm approximately 73 degrees C). This minor endotherm was also responsive to Ca2+ binding and, in the absence of PS/POPC membranes, corresponded to melting of the N-terminal, Ca2+ and membrane binding domain (fragment 1). Peak deconvolution analysis of the prothrombin denaturation profile and extensive studies of the denaturation of isolated prothrombin domains in the presence and absence of PS/POPC vesicles suggested that membrane binding induced changes in the C-terminal catalytic domain of prothrombin (prethrombin 2) and in a domain that links fragment 1 with the catalytic domain (fragment 2). Specifically, the results have confirmed that the fragment 2 domain interacts with the stabilizes the prethrombin 2 domain and also have shown that fragment 2 interacts directly with the membrane. In addition, the results have demonstrated a heretofore unrecognized interaction between the catalytic and membrane binding domains. This interaction can account for another portion of the denaturation enthalpy that appears at high temperatures in the presence of membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Earlier studies of the unfolding pathway of native bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (using dithiothreitol as the reducing agent) revealed that the three-disulfide species lacking the disulfide bond between cysteine 65 and cysteine 72 is the most highly populated intermediate [Rothwarf & Scheraga (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 6293-6294]. This unfolding intermediate is referred to as des-[65-72]-RNase A. In order to determine the role of des-[65-72]-RNase A, i.e. of the 65-72 disulfide bond, in the structural folding/unfolding processes of RNase A, the stability and structure of this unfolding intermediate were determined by examining its thermal transition curve and by using two- and three-dimensional homonuclear 1H NMR spectroscopy. The midpoint of the thermal transition of des-[65-72]-RNase A was found to be 17.8 degrees C lower than that of native RNase A. A set of conformations that are consistent with the NMR-derived constraints was obtained by minimizing, first, a variable-target function and, then, the conformational energy. These conformations exhibit a well-defined structure that is very similar to that of native ribonuclease A in regions where the native protein has a regular backbone structure such as a beta-sheet or a helix. Some of the loop regions of the several computed structures exhibit large deviations from each other as well as from native ribonuclease A. However, these results indicate that des-[65-72]-RNase A has a close structural similarity to RNase A in all regions with the only major differences occurring in a loop region comprising residues 60-72. This led to the conclusion that, in reduction pathways that include des-[65-72]-RNase A (at 25 degrees C, pH 8.0), the rate-determining step corresponds to a partial unfolding event in one region of the protein and not to a global conformational unfolding process. The results further suggest that, in the regeneration pathways involving des-[65-72]-RNase A, the loop region from 60 to 72 is the last to fold.",

        "abstract": "The contributions of the components of a type I reverse turn to the stability of chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 (Lys43-Pro44-Gly45) have been determined by protein engineering methods. A double-mutant cycle was used to determine the interaction between Lys43 and Glu45 by replacing them with alanine. We also mutated Pro44, which gives the geometry of the turn, to alanine and analysed the stability of the resulting mutants compared with wild-type chymotrypsin inhibitor-2, using equilibrium denaturation induced by guanidinium chloride. There are decreases in stability (in kcal/mol) of 0.64 +/- 0.06 for Lys43-->Ala, 0.57 +/- 0.15 for Glu45-->Ala, 0.95 +/- 0.06 for Lys43-->Ala/Glu45-->Ala and 1.93 +/- 0.09 for Pro44-->Ala. The free energy of interaction between Lys43 and Glu45 is calculated to be only 0.25 +/- 0.09 kcal/mol. From the changes in denaturation midpoint, Tm measured by circular dichroism, we estimate the energy of interaction between Lys43 and Glu45 to be 0.36 +/- 0.07 kcal/mol whereas the contribution of Pro44 is approximately 2.0 kcal/mol. The contribution of the salt bridge to the stability of the protein is very small and the residue Pro44 plays the key role in stabilizing the turn.",

Biol., 248, 733-738) estimates the changes in conformational stability due to single amino acid substitutions using a pseudo-energy potential developed for evaluating structure-sequence compatibility in the structure prediction method, the 3D-1D compatibility evaluation. Nine mutant human lysozymes expected to significantly increase in stability from SPMP were constructed, in order to experimentally verify the reliability of SPMP. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation and crystal structures of these mutant proteins were determined. One mutant protein was stabilized as expected, compared with the wild-type protein. However, the others were not stabilized even though the structural changes were subtle, indicating that SPMP overestimates the increase in stability or underestimates negative effects due to substitution. The stability changes in the other mutant human lysozymes previously reported were also analyzed by SPMP. The correlation of the stability changes between the experiment and prediction depended on the types of substitution: there were some correlations for proline mutants and cavity-creating mutants, but no correlation for mutants related to side-chain hydrogen bonds. The present results may indicate some additional factors that should be considered in the calculation of SPMP, suggesting that SPMP can be refined further.",

Here we analyze the biochemical and biophysical properties of peptides corresponding to amino acids 319-358 of wild-type human p53, which includes the tetramerization domain, and that of a cancer-derived mutant with valine substituted for glycine 334. Unlike the wild-type peptide, the G334V peptide forms amyloid fibrils by a two-step process under physiological conditions of temperature and pH. Nevertheless, the G334V peptide is capable of forming heterooligomers with a wild-type peptide. Computational modeling of the G334V peptide structure suggests that substitution of valine for glycine 334 causes a local distortion that contributes to a beta-dominated structural transition leading to amyloid formation. Since the distortion is mostly on the surface, the mutant peptide is still able to form a pseudonative tetramer complex at higher concentrations and/or lower temperatures. Our study suggests a new potential mechanism by which mutations that compromise tetramer formation inactivate p53 as a tumor suppressor.",

        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori cysteine-rich proteins (Hcps) are disulfide-containing repeat proteins. The repeating unit is a 36-residue, disulfide-bridged, helix-loop-helix motif. We use the protein HcpB, which has four repeats and four disulfide bridges arrayed in tandem, as a model to determine the thermodynamic stability of a disulfide-rich repeat protein and to study the formation and the contribution to stability of the disulfide bonds. When the disulfide bonds are intact, the chemical unfolding of HcpB at pH 5 is cooperative and can be described by a two-state reaction. Thermal unfolding is reversible between pH 2 and 5 and irreversible at higher pH 5. Differential scanning calorimetry shows noncooperative structural changes preceding the main thermal unfolding transition. Unfolding of the oxidized protein is not an all-or-none two-state process, and the disulfide bonds prevent complete unfolding of the polypeptide chain. The reduced protein is significantly less stable and does not unfold in a cooperative way. During oxidative refolding of the fully reduced protein, all the possible disulfide intermediates with a correct disulfide bond are formed. Formation of \"wrong\" (non-native) disulfide bonds could not be demonstrated, indicating that the reduced protein already has some partial repeating structure. There is a major folding intermediate with disulfides in the second, third, and fourth repeat and reduced cysteines in the first repeat. Disulfide formation in the first repeat limits the overall rate of oxidative refolding and contributes about half of the thermodynamic stability to native HcpB, estimated as 27 kJ mol(-1) at 25 degrees C and pH 7. The high contribution to stability of the first repeat may be explained by the repeat acting as a cap to protect the hydrophobic interior of the molecule.",

At neutral solvent conditions the R69 domain maintains its native structure, both in isolated form and within the dimers. The stability of the domain depends highly upon pH within the acidic range, thus at pH 2 and low ionic strength R69 is already partially unfolded at room temperature. The thermodynamic parameters of unfolding calculated from the DSC data are typical for small globular proteins. At neutral pH and moderate ionic strength, the domains of the dimers behave as two independent units with unfolding parameters similar to those of the isolated domain, which means that linking two R69 domains, either by a long peptide linker or by a designed C-terminal disulfide bridge, does not induce any cooperation between them.",

        "abstract": "We recently reported on a new H/D exchange- and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry-based technique, termed SUPREX, that removes several important limitations associated with measuring the thermodynamic stability of proteins. In contrast to conventional spectroscopy-based techniques for characterizing the equilibrium unfolding behavior of proteins, SUPREX is amenable to the thermodynamic analysis of both purified and unpurified proteins using mg to ng quantities of material. Here we report on the application of SUPREX to the analysis of multimeric protein systems. Included in this work are the SUPREX results we obtained in studies on six model multimeric proteins including the GCN4p1 dimer, the coil-V(a)L(d) trimer, the 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) hexamer, the Trp repressor (TrpR) dimer, the Arc repressor (ArcR) dimer, and an ArcR mutant (the (DOA20)ArcR) dimer which contained two destabilizing mutations including an Asp to Ala mutation at position 20 and an amide to ester bond mutation between amino acid (aa) residues 19 and 20. As part of the work described here, we present a new method for the analysis of SUPREX data that is generally applicable to both monomeric and multimeric protein systems. Our results on the model proteins in this study indicate that this new method can be used to determine folding free energies for proteins with the accuracy and precision of conventional spectroscopy-based methods.",

        "abstract": "The single tryptophan residue (Trp187) of human recombinant annexin V, containing 320 residues and 5328 atoms, was replaced with three different isosteric analogues where hydrogen atoms at positions 4, 5, and 6 in the indole ring were exchanged with fluorine. Such single atom exchanges of H --> F represent atomic mutations that result in slightly increased covalent bond lengths and inverted polarities in the residue side-chain structure. These minimal changes in the local geometry do not affect the secondary and tertiary structures of the mutants, which were identical to those of wild-type protein in the crystal form. But the mutants exhibit significant differences in stability, folding cooperativity, biological activity, and fluorescence properties if compared to the wild-type protein. These rather large global effects, resulting from the minimal local changes, have to be attributed either to the relatively strong changes in polar interactions of the indole ring or to differences in the van der Waals radii or to a combination of both facts. The changes in local geometry that are below resolution of protein X-ray crystallographic studies are probably of secondary importance in comparison to the strong electronegativity introduced by the fluorine atom. Correspondingly, these types of mutations provide an interesting approach to study cooperative functions of integrated residues and modulation of particular physicochemical properties, in the present case of electronegativity, in a uniquely structured and hierarchically organized protein molecule.",

We determined previously that the replacement of a partially buried Lys residue with Glu at position 49 in E.coli HPr increased the conformational stability of the protein substantially because the side-chain of the latter residue could act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor. Here, we extend this analysis to other side-chains with different chemical properties and abilities to form hydrogen bonds to compare the properties of this position in the backgrounds of two different homologous HPr proteins. We find that the variants with polar residues that can form a tertiary hydrogen bond with a nearby site in the protein are more stable than either hydrophobic residues or polar residues that become buried yet are incapable of forming a new hydrogen bond. Furthermore, the protein with the wild-type residue in each HPr variant is not among the most stable of the proteins studied. These results suggest a general strategy for designing variants in which the overall stability of a protein can be modulated in a defined fashion.",

Structural analyses predicted that the side chains of introduced Tyr-34 and Tyr-43 become hydrogen donors for the hydrogen bond formation with heme 17-propionate at pH 5.0, but less efficiently at pH 3.6, because the propionate is deprotonated at the higher pH.

In the presence of 2 M urea, a cooperative unfolding transition was observed both with increasing and decreasing temperature. The CD spectrum indicated that the heat and cold-denatured states of ELG have substantial secondary structures but lack persistent tertiary packing of the side-chains. In order to clarify the relation between the heat or cold-denatured state and the acid-denatured (A) state characterized previously, we have attempted to observe the temperature dependence of the CD spectrum at pH 1.5. The CD spectrum in the heat-denatured state is similar to that in the A state. The CD spectrum in the A state does not change cooperatively with increasing temperature. These results indicate that the heat-denatured state and the A state are the same structural state. On the other hand, the CD intensity at acid pH cooperatively increased with decreasing temperature. The CD spectrum at low temperature and acid pH is consistent with that in the cold-denatured state. Therefore, the cold-denatured state is distinguished from the heat-denatured state or the A state, and ELG assumes a larger amount of non-native alpha-helices in the cold-denatured state. Small angle X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation have indicated that ELG assumes an expanded chain-like conformation in the cold-denatured state in contrast to the compact globular conformation in the A state. The relation between the molecular size and the helical content in the partially folded states is discussed.",

        "abstract": "The high-resolution solution structure of a monomeric circular permuted (cp) variant of the potent HIV-inactivating protein cyanovirin-N (CV-N) was determined by NMR. Comparison with the wild-type (wt) structure revealed that the observed loss in stability of cpCV-N compared to the wt protein is due to less favorable packing of several residues at the pseudo twofold axis that are responsible for holding the two halves of the molecule together. In particular, the N and C-terminal amino acid residues exhibit conformational flexibility, resulting in fewer and less favorable contacts between them. The important hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding network between residues W49, D89, H90, Y100 and E101 that was observed in wt CV-N is no longer present. For instance, Y100 and E101 are flexible and the tryptophan side-chain is in a different conformation compared to the wt protein. The stability loss amounts to approximately 2kcal/mol and the mobility of the protein is evident by fast amide proton exchange throughout the chain. Mutation of the single proline residue to glycine (P52G) did not substantially affect the stability of the protein, in contrast to the finding for wtCV-N. The binding of high-mannose type oligosaccharides to cpCV-N was also investigated. Similar to wtCV-N, two carbohydrate-binding sites were identified on the protein and the Man alpha1-->2Man linked moieties on the sugar were delineated as binding epitopes. Unlike in wtCV-N, the binding sites on cpCV-N are structurally similar and exhibit comparable binding affinities for the respective sugars. On the basis of the studies presented here and previous results on high-mannose binding to wtCV-N, we discuss a model for the interaction between gp120 and CV-N.",

Differential scanning calorimetry of barnase deviates from two-state behavior below pH 4.0 at low ionic strength, with the maximum discrepancy at pH 2.7. Addition of 200 mM KCl apparently restores the two-state transitions. Thermograms of barnase mutants at pH 2.7 and low ionic strength fall into three classes: alpha, symmetric transitions which fit well to a two-state equilibrium; b, asymmetric transitions indicating deviation from two-state behavior; and c, transitions with an obvious second component. The most distorted thermograms are observed for mutants that had previously been engineered to accumulate at equilibrium the major kinetic folding intermediate state of barnase at neutral pH. Further analysis of these mutants show the existence of complex equilibria on thermal denaturation. Addition of KCl leads to the slow formation of soluble aggregated forms (A-state) which share some of the properties of the \"molten globule\" state, i.e., significant secondary structure, lack of fixed tertiary structure, and solvent-accessible hydrophobic patches. The far-UV CD spectrum of the A-state can be explained in terms of native-like secondary structure contributions. Kinetic and chemical cross-linking experiments show that dimerization of partly-folded molecules occurs in the transition region, and such dimerization is probably the rate-limiting step in the formation of the A-state in the presence of KCl. As the A-state has been observed clearly so far for only the mutants in which the folding intermediate has been designed to accumulate, we suggest that the A-state would be related to the main folding intermediate state of barnase. The intermediate would be highly stabilized at low pH, and it is prone to self-associate in these conditions.",

(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21535-21542). Another mutation within the alpha II-helix, Gly-77-->Ala, reduces the stability by 0.9 kcal/mol. Simultaneous introduction of these mutations enhances the stability by 0.8 kcal/mol, indicating that the effects of these mutations are cooperative and not simply independent. We determined the crystal structures of these three mutant proteins (G80b-, A77-, and A77/G80b-RNase H) to investigate this cooperative mechanism of the protein stabilization. The structures revealed that the inserted Gly-80b assumes a left-handed helical conformation in both the G80b- and the A77/G80b-RNase H. This inserted glycine residue allows the formation of a \"paperclip\", which is a common motif at the C-termini of alpha-helices. Accompanying the formation of the paperclip motif, two intrahelical hydrogen bonds are formed between the backbone atoms (O78-N80b and O80b-N84). The stabilization caused by the insertion of Gly-80b can be ascribed to the formation of these hydrogen bonds. The Gly-77-->Ala substitution destabilizes the protein due to the deformed packing interactions in the hydrophobic core around Ala-77 and the stress in the wedged indole ring of Trp-81. These effects are alleviated by the insertion of Gly-80b, which relaxes the backbone structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The corresponding mutations were constructed in TyrRS(Delta1), a derivative of TyrRS from B. stearothermophilus in which the anticodon binding domain is deleted. Mutations I52L (i.e. Ile52 into Leu), M55L and L105V did not affect the activity of TyrRS(Delta1) in the pyrophosphate exchange reaction whereas T51P increased it. The kinetic stabilities of TyrRS(Delta1) and its mutant derivatives at 68.5 degreesC were determined from experiments of irreversible thermal precipitation. They were in the order L105V<I52L<T51P<Wild Type</=M55L; mutation I52L partially compensated L105V in these experiments whereas M55L was coupled neither to I52L nor to L105V. Mutations I52L and L105V affected the stability of the dimeric TyrRS(Delta1) at different steps of its unfolding by urea, monitored under equilibrium conditions by spectrofluorometry or size exclusion chromatography. I52L destabilized the association between the subunits even though residue Ile52 is more than 20 A away from the subunit interface. L105V destabilized the monomeric intermediate of unfolding. The two mutational pathways, going from the wild-type TyrRS(Delta1) to the I52L-L105V double mutant through each of the single mutants were not equivalent for the stability of the monomeric intermediate and for the total stability of the dimer. One pathway contained two neutral steps whereas the other pathway contained a destabilizing step followed by a stabilizing step. Mutation I52L allowed L105V along the first pathway and compensated it along the second pathway. Thus, the effects of I52L and L105V on stability depended on the structural context. The gain in activity due to T51P was at the expense of a slight destabilization.",

On the basis of patterns observed in the value of m--the rate of change of log Kapp (the apparent equilibrium constant between the native and denatured states) with denaturant concentration--these proteins can be grouped into two classes. For class I mutants, the value of m with guanidine hydrochloride is less than the wild-type value and is either constant or increases slightly with increasing denaturant; the value of m with urea is also less than wild type but shows a marked increase with increasing denaturant concentration, often approaching but never exceeding the wild-type value. For class II mutants, m is constant and is greater than wild type in both denaturants, with the increase being consistently larger in guanidine hydrochloride than in urea. When double or triple mutants are constructed from members of the same mutant class, the change in m is usually the sum of the changes produced by each mutation in isolation. One plausible explanation for these altered patterns of denaturation is that chain-chain or chain-solvent interactions in the denatured state have been modified--interactions which appear to involve hydrophobic groups.",

For this purpose, destabilized mutations were introduced in betaB1-crystallin targeting the domain interface within the fold of a subunit. Global unfolding was monitored by tryptophan fluorescence while concomitant structural changes at the dimer interface were monitored by fluorescence and spin labels. Both spectral probes report explicit evidence of multi-state unfolding equilibrium. The biphasic nature of the unfolding curves was more pronounced at higher protein concentration. Distinct shifts in the midpoint of the second transition reflect the population of a dimeric intermediate.

The hydrogen exchange rate constants of the hydrogen-bonded residues varied over eight orders of magnitude at 25 degrees C with 13 residues showing exchange rates consistent with exchange occurring as a result of global unfolding. These residues are located in strands 2-4 of the central beta-pleated sheet. The residues located in the alpha-helix and the remaining strands of the beta-sheet exhibited exchange behaviors consistent with exchange occurring due to local structural fluctuations. For several residues at 25 degrees C, the global free energy change calculated from the hydrogen exchange data was over 2 kcal/mol greater than the free energy of unfolding determined from urea denaturation experiments. The number of residues showing this unexpected behavior was found to increase with temperature. This apparent inconsistency can be explained quantitatively if the cis-trans isomerization of the two cis prolines, Pro-39 and Pro-55, is taken into account. The cis-trans isomerization equilibrium calculated from kinetic data indicates the free energy of the unfolded state will be 2.6 kcal/mol higher at 25 degrees C when the two prolines are cis rather than trans (Mayr LM, Odefey CO, Schutkowski M, Schmid FX. 1996. Kinetic analysis of the unfolding and refolding of ribonuclease T1 by a stopped-flow double-mixing technique. Biochemistry 35: 5550-5561). The hydrogen exchange results are consistent with the most slowly exchanging hydrogens exchanging from a globally higher free energy unfolded state in which Pro-55 and Pro-39 are still predominantly in the cis conformation. When the conformational stabilities determined by hydrogen exchange are corrected for the proline isomerization equilibrium, the results are in excellent agreement with those from an analysis of urea denaturation curves.",

        "abstract": "The effects of regional sequence differences on the thermodynamic stability of a globular protein have been investigated by scanning microcalorimetry. Thermal transitions have been measured for two isozymes of yeast cytochrome c (iso-1-MS and iso-2) and three composite proteins (Comp1-MS, Comp2-MS, and Comp3-MS) in which amino acid segments are exchanged between the parental isozymes. There are three main observations. (1) In the temperature range of the unfolding transitions (40-60 degrees C) the unfolding free energies for the composite proteins are only slightly different from those of the parental isozymes, although in some cases there are large but compensating changes in the transitional enthalpy and entropy. At lower temperatures (0-30 degrees C), all the composites are significantly less stable than the two parental proteins. (2) Long-range structural effects are responsible for at least some of the observed differences in stability. For example, in the temperature range of the unfolding transitions (40-60 degrees C), the Comp1-MS protein which contains only a small amount of iso-2-like sequence is less stable than either of the parental isozymes, despite the fact that none of the iso-2-specific amino acid side chains impinges directly on any of the iso-1-specific amino acid side chains. (3) Changes in ionization of His 26 appear to be linked to thermal unfolding. Iso-1-MS and Comp1-MS contain a histidine residue at position 26 while iso-2 and the other two composites do not. On lowering the pH from pH 6 to 5, both iso-1-MS and Comp1-MS show a decrease in stability (lower Tm) within the unfolding transition region (40-60 degrees C), whereas the stabilities of iso-2, Comp2-MS, and Comp3-MS are essentially unchanged. The thermal unfolding transitions are highly reversible (> 95%) but mechanistically complex. A moderate dependence of Tm on protein concentration and the ratio of the van't Hoff enthalpy to the calorimetric enthalpy suggest that thermal unfolding involves the reversible association of a significant fraction of the unfolded species, at least at elevated protein concentrations.",

        "abstract": "The active form of the hydrophilic subunit (IIABman) of the mannose transporter of Escherichia coli is a homodimer of two 35-kDa subunits. Each subunit consists of two distinct domains, IIA and IIB, which can be separated by limited trypsin digestion. Separation of tryptic fragments yields monomers of IIB and dimers of IIA, which are active and stable. To test whether the domains fold as independent units, the effects of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and temperature on the structural stability of the intact IIABman were compared with those of the isolated fragments. Equilibrium GuHCl-induced reversible unfolding, measured by circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence, showed a biphasic transition for intact IIABman and monophasic transitions for each isolated fragment. The midpoint transitions of the isolated IIB and IIA fragments (at 1.0 and 2.3 M GuHCl) coincide with the first and second transitions of intact IIABman. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies suggested that dissociation precedes the unfolding of IIA. Thermal unfolding of IIABman, monitored by differential scanning calorimetry, showed two well-separated transitions near 52 and 95 degrees C which corresponded to the midpoint transitions of the isolated IIB and IIA fragments. The combined results demonstrate an independent stepwise unfolding of the domains in IIABman as well as the absence of stabilizing interdomain interactions. The lack of interdomain interactions suggests an unrestricted domain motion. This may play an important role in the phosphoryl transfer reaction which is catalyzed by the binding of IIABman to a phosphoryl carrier protein HPr (via the IIA domain) and to the transmembrane subunits of the mannose transporter (via the IIB domain).",

Using alternating-laser excitation and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 as a model, we show that chemical labeling of a unique cysteine, followed by enzymatic modification of a reactive glutamine in an N-terminally appended substrate sequence recognition tag for transglutaminase (TGase) affords stoichiometrically D-/A-labeled protein suitable for single-molecule FRET experiments. Thermodynamic data indicate that neither the presence of the TGase tag nor D/A labeling perturbs protein stability. As the N terminus in proteins is typically solvent accessible, a TGase tag can (in principle) be appended to any protein of interest by genetic engineering. Two-step chemical/enzymatic labeling may thus represent a simple, low-cost, and widely available strategy for D/A labeling of proteins for FRET-based single-molecule protein folding studies, even for non-protein-experts laboratories.",

        "abstract": "As reported previously (MacDonald, R. I., Musacchio, A., Holmgren, R. A., and Saraste, M. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 1299-1303), an unfolded peptide was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of Trp-22 to Ala in the cloned, wild type 17th repeating unit (alpha17) of chicken brain alpha-spectrin. Trp occurs in position 22 of nearly all repeating units of spectrin. In the present study, Trp-22 was mutated to Phe or to Tyr to compare thermodynamic stabilities of urea-induced unfolding of alpha16 and mutants thereof. alpha16 was chosen for this study instead of alpha17, because alpha16 has two tryptophans, allowing urea-induced unfolding to be tracked by the fluorescence of the Trp remaining in each mutant peptide and by circular dichroism in the far UV. The free energies of unfolding of W22Y and W22F were 50% that of alpha16, showing that Trp-22 is crucial in stabilizing the triple helical bundle motif of the spectrin repeating unit. Mutation of the moderately conserved Trp-95 of alpha16 to Val, which occupies position 95 in alpha17, also yielded a peptide with 50% of the free energy of unfolding of alpha16. Thus, the thermodynamic stability of a given spectrin repeating unit may depend on both moderately and highly conserved tryptophans. Different structural roles of Trp-22 and Trp-95 in alpha16 are suggested by the slightly higher wavelength of maximum emission of Trp-22, the greater acrylamide quenching of Trp-95 than Trp-22, and the longer lifetime of Trp-95. For comparison with alpha16, urea-induced unfolding of spectrin dimer isolated from human red cells was monitored by far UV-CD and by tryptophan fluorescence. Thermodynamic parameters could not be rigorously derived for the stability of spectrin dimer because unfolding of spectrin dimer involved more than two states, unlike unfolding of cloned repeating units. However, the similar midpoints of CD-monitored denaturation curves of alpha16 and spectrin dimer, i. e. 2.7 and 3.2 M urea, respectively, indicate that investigation of cloned repeating units of spectrin can provide physiologically relevant information on these structures.",

(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19294-19299). Single Trp mutant enzymes were constructed and used in combination with other methods to show that on the folding pathway of this enzyme two domains rapidly fold to form a monomer in which the amino-terminal 55 amino acid residues and a segment around the active site region of Lys229 remain in a largely disordered form. This partially folded enzyme can form dimers and slowly undergoes a rate-determining conformational change in which the unstructured segments assume their native state (Cai, K. , and Schirch, V. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2987-2994). To further assess the kinetics and structural details of the intermediates during folding, fluorescence energy transfer and fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made of the three Trp residues and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, attached covalently to the active site by reduction to a secondary amine by sodium cyanoborohydride. These studies confirmed that the basic kinetic folding pathway remained the same in the reduced enzyme as compared to the earlier studies with the apoenzyme. Both equilibrium and kinetic intermediates were identified and their structural characteristics determined. The results show that the active site Lys229-bound pyridoxyl 5'-phosphate remains more than 50 angstroms from any Trp residues until the final rate-determining conformational change when it approaches each Trp residue at the same rate. The environment of each Trp residue and the pyridoxyl phosphate in both an equilibrium folding intermediate and a kinetic folding intermediate are described.",

(1997) Biochemistry 36, 119-126] showed that this variant unfolds through a nativelike intermediate that has properties consistent with replacement of the Met 80 heme ligand by His 73. Here, the pH dependence of the equilibrium unfolding of the wild type (WT) and H73 proteins have been investigated, since a characteristic pH dependence is expected for the stability of an intermediate stabilized by histidine-heme ligation. Stability has been evaluated using guanidine hydrochloride and pH denaturation methods. Above pH 5, the m-values from guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of the WT and H73 variants remain significantly different, consistent with continued population of this intermediate. At pH 4.5 the m-values for the two proteins are within error the same. To assess stability at lower pH, acid denaturation was carried out. The midpoint is about 3.3 for both proteins but the transition is broader for the H73 protein, suggestive of intermediates again being populated during the unfolding of the H73 protein at this lower pH. Heme ligation by Met 80 was monitored (695 nm absorbance) during gdnHCl (pH 4.5 and 5.0) and acid denaturation, confirming, respectively, the absence and presence of intermediates. A thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that this complex pH dependence for the presence of histidine ligation induced intermediates is expected and implicates a titratable group with a pKa of approximately 6.6. The analysis also demonstrates when the pH dependences of global stability and stability of an intermediate differ significantly, population of folding intermediates as a function of pH will show novel behavior.",

The denatured ensemble populated under these conditions comprises conformations that are compact. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments indicate a small increase in Stokes radius over that of the native state. A significant degree of alpha-helical structure in these conformations is detected by far-UV circular dichroism, and some tertiary interactions are suggested by near-UV circular dichroism. The characteristics of the denatured state populated by methionine oxidation in nondenaturing buffer are very different from those found in chemical denaturant.",

        "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry and size-exclusion chromatography have been used to characterize the dimerization and unfolding of the 205-316 C-terminal fragment of thermolysin at pH 7.5. We show that the folded fragment dimerizes at low temperature with a moderate affinity and undergoes thermal unfolding according to a N(2) <==> 2N <==> 2U model. This behavior has already been observed at acid pH, where a similar dissociation equilibrium has been found [Azuaga, A., Conejero-Lara, F., Rivas G., De Filippis, V., Fontana A., & Mateo, P. L. (1995) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1252, 95-102]. Nevertheless, at pH 7.5 the dimerization equilibrium slows down below about 30 degrees C, with virtually no interconversion between the monomeric and the dimeric states of the fragment. We have studied the kinetics of interconversion between monomer and dimer by size-exclusion chromatography experiments and have shown that a very high energy barrier (83.8 kJ/mol at 26.5 degrees C) exists between either state. A mathematical analysis of the DSC thermograms on the basis of the proposed model has allowed us to obtain the thermodynamic characterization of the dimerization and the unfolding processes of the fragment and confirms the kinetic parameters obtained in the chromatographic experiments. The thermodynamic functions for the unfolding of the fragment are compatible with some degree of disorder in the structures of both the monomer and the dimer. According to circular dichroism measurements, the dimerization of the fragment seems to be linked to some conformational change in the subunits, most probably due to a rearrangement of the existing secondary-structure elements. This fragment displays several features already observed in folding intermediates, such as the partial disorder of the polypeptidic chain, association processes, and kinetic barriers between different regions in the conformational space.",

        "abstract": "There is currently a great deal of interest in proteins that fold in a single highly cooperative step. Particular attention has been focused on elucidating the factors that govern folding rates of simple proteins. Recently, the topology of the native state has been proposed to be the most important determinant of their folding rates. Here we report a comparative study of the folding of three topologically equivalent proteins that adapt a particularly simple alpha/beta fold. The folding kinetics of the N-terminal domain of RNase HI and the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 from Escherichia coli (eNTL9) were compared to the previously characterized N-terminal domain of L9 from Bacillus stearothermophilus (bNTL9). This 6.2 kDa protein, which is one of simplest examples of the ABCalphaD motif, folds via a two-state mechanism on the millisecond to submillisecond time scale. The RNase HI domain and bNTL9 have very similar tertiary structures but there is little similarity in primary sequence. bNTL9 and eNTL9 share the same biological function and a similar primary sequence but differ significantly in stability. Fluorescence-detected stopped-flow experiments showed that the three proteins fold in a two-state fashion. The folding rates in the absence of denaturant were found to be very different, ranging form 21 s(-1) to 790 s(-1) at 10 degrees C. The diverse folding rates appear to reflect large differences in the stability of the proteins. When compared at an isostability point, the folding rates converged to a similar value and there is a strong linear correlation between the log of the folding rate and stability for this set of proteins. These observations are consistent with the idea that stability can play an important role in dictating relative folding rates among topologically equivalent proteins.",

The mutants studied were R96H [Kitamura, S., & Sturtevant, J.M.

(1991) Biochemistry 30, 1887-1891]. Here we report the results of a similar study of the single mutations A82P, A93P, and G113A and the double mutation C54T:C97A. The three single mutants all show small apparent stabilization at pH 2.5 and 46.2 degrees C (the denaturational temperature of the wild-type protein), amounting to -0.5 +/- 0.4 kcal mol-1 in free energy, whereas the double mutant shows a weak apparent destabilization, +0.8 +/- 0.4 kcal mol-1. As in all our previous studies of mutant proteins, the enthalpy changes produced by these mutations are in general of much larger magnitude than the corresponding free energy changes and frequently of opposite sign.",

        "abstract": "The folding/unfolding equilibrium of the alpha-spectrin SH3 domain has been measured by NMR-detected hydrogen/deuterium exchange and by differential scanning calorimetry. Protection factors against exchange have been obtained under native conditions for more than half of the residues in the domain. Most protected residues are located at the beta-strands, the short 3(10) helix, and part of the long RT loop, whereas the loops connecting secondary structure elements show no measurable protection. Apparent stability constants per residue and their corresponding Gibbs energies have been calculated from the exchange experiments. The most stable region of the SH3 domain is defined by the central portions of the beta-strands. The peptide binding region, on the other hand, is composed of a highly stable region (residues 53-57) and a highly unstable region, the loop between residues 34-41 (n-Src loop). All residues in the domain have apparent Gibbs energies lower than the global unfolding Gibbs energy measured by differential scanning calorimetry, indicating that under our experimental conditions the amide exchange of all residues in the SH3 domain occurs primarily via local unfolding reactions. A structure-based thermodynamic analysis has allowed us to predict correctly the thermodynamics of the global unfolding of the domain and to define the ensemble of conformational states that quantitatively accounts for the observed pattern of hydrogen exchange protection. These results demonstrate that under native conditions the SH3 domain needs to be considered as an ensemble of conformations and that the hydrogen exchange data obtained under those conditions cannot be interpreted by a two-state equilibrium. The observation that specific regions of a protein are able to undergo independent local folding/unfolding reactions indicates that under native conditions the scale of cooperative interactions is regional rather than global.",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus equisimilis streptokinase (SK) is a single-chain protein of 414 residues that is used extensively in the clinical treatment of acute myocardial infarction due to its ability to activate human plasminogen (Plg). The mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood due to the lack of structural details concerning both molecules and their complex. We reported recently (Parrado J et al., 1996, Protein Sci 5:693-704) that SK is composed of three structural domains (A, B, and C) with a C-terminal tail that is relatively unstructured. Here, we report thermal unfolding experiments, monitored by CD and NMR, using samples of intact SK, five isolated SK fragments, and two two-chain noncovalent complexes between complementary fragments of the protein. These experiments have allowed the unfolding processes of specific domains of the protein to be monitored and their relative stabilities and interdomain interactions to be characterized. Results demonstrate that SK can exist in a number of partially unfolded states, in which individual domains of the protein behave as single cooperative units. Domain B unfolds cooperatively in the first thermal transition at approximately 46 degrees C and its stability is largely independent of the presence of the other domains. The high-temperature transition in intact SK (at approximately 63 degrees C) corresponds to the unfolding of both domains A and C. Thermal stability of domain C is significantly increased by its isolation from the rest of the chain. By contrast, cleavage of the Phe 63-Ala 64 peptide bond within domain A causes thermal destabilization of this domain. The two resulting domain portions (A1 and A2) adopt unstructured conformations when separated. A1 binds with high affinity to all fragments that contain the A2 portion, with a concomitant restoration of the native-like fold of domain A. This result demonstrates that the mechanism whereby A1 stimulates the plasminogen activator activities of complementary SK fragments is the reconstitution of the native-like structure of domain A.",

        "abstract": "A method has been developed to select proteins that are thermodynamically destabilized yet still folded and functional. The DNA encoding the B1 IgG-binding domain from Group G Streptococcus (Strp G) has been fused to gene III of bacteriophage M13. The resulting fusion protein is displayed on the surface of the phage thus enabling the phage to bind to IgG molecules. In addition, these phage exhibit a small plaque phenotype that is reversed by mutations that destabilize the Strp G domain. By selecting phage with large plaque morphology that retain their IgG-binding function, it is possible to identify mutants that are folded but destabilized compared with wild-type Strp G. Such mutants can be divided into three general categories: 1) those that disrupt packing of hydrophobic side chains in the protein interior; 2) those that destabilize secondary structure; and 3) those that alter specific hydrogen bonds involving amino acid side chains. A number of the mutants have been physically characterized by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance and have been shown to have structures similar to wild-type Strp G but stabilities that were decreased by 2-5 kcal/mol.",

A distinct equilibrium intermediate of the apoprotein could be detected at low concentrations of guanidinium chloride (0.5 M). This intermediate has a secondary structure content like that of the native protein but a poorly defined tertiary structure. Renaturation of the apo-HRP is reversible and 100% activity could be obtained after addition of a twofold excess of free haem. The denaturation of the holo-HRP is more complex and occurs in two distinct steps; unfolding of the protein backbone and loss of the haem. The denatured protein folds back to its native conformation but the incorporation of the haem occurs only after the secondary structure is formed. Ca2+ appears to be important for the stability of the protein as the apo-HRP is more resistant to denaturation in the presence of Ca2+. The free-energy change during unfolding of the apo-HRP was determined in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and found to be 9.2 kJ/mol and 16.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The importance of Ca2+ to the protein stability was also supported by studies on the loss of the haem from the protoporphyrin-IX-apo-HRP complex.",

The structure and the thermal stability of bovine alpha-crystallin were studied by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and differential scanning calorimetry. Infrared spectroscopic data provide evidence which corroborates the view that the secondary structure of alpha-crystallin is highly ordered and consists predominantly of beta-sheets. However, the present results fail to support the widespread notion of an extremely high thermal stability of the protein. All three experimental approaches used in this study show that alpha-crystallin undergoes a major thermotropic transition with a midpoint at 60-62 degrees C. Furthermore, Fourier-transform infrared spectra provide evidence that this conformational transition is associated with a massive loss of the native beta-sheet structure. These results shed new light on structural properties of alpha-crystallin and have important implications for understanding the mechanism of the chaperone-like action of this protein.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this article is to gain a better understanding of the denatured state ensemble (DSE) of proteins through an experimental and computational study of their denaturation by urea. Proteins unfold to different extents in urea and the most hydrophobic proteins have the most compact DSE and contain almost as much secondary structure as folded proteins. Proteins that unfold to the greatest extent near pH 7 still contain substantial amounts of secondary structure. At low pH, the DSE expands due to charge-charge interactions and when the net charge per residue is high, most of the secondary structure is disrupted. The proteins in the DSE appear to contain substantial amounts of polyproline II conformation at high urea concentrations. In all cases considered, including staph nuclease, the extent of unfolding by urea can be accounted for using the data and approach developed in the laboratory of Wayne Bolen (Auton et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci 2007; 104:15317-15323).",

        "abstract": "To determine how much information can be transferred from folding and unfolding studies of one protein to another member of the same family or between the mesophilic and thermophilic homologues of a protein, we have characterized the equilibrium unfolding process of the dimeric enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) from two sources, Bacillus subtilis (bsSHMT) and Bacillus stearothermophilus (bstSHMT). Although the sequences of the two enzymes are highly identical ( approximately 77%) and homologous (89%), bstSHMT shows a significantly higher stability against both thermal and urea denaturation than bsSHMT. The GdmCl-induced unfolding of bsSHMT was found to be a two-step process with dissociation of the native dimer, resulting in stabilization of a monomeric species, followed by the unfolding of the monomeric species. A similar unfolding pathway has been reported for Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase, a member of the type I fold family of PLP binding enzymes such as SHMT, the sequence of which is only slightly identical ( approximately 14%) with that of SHMT. In contrast, for bstSHMT, a highly cooperative unfolding without stabilization of any monomeric intermediate was observed. These studies suggest that mesophilic proteins of the same structural family even sharing a low level of sequence identity may follow a common unfolding mechanism, whereas the mesophilic and thermophilic homologues of the same protein despite having a high degree of sequence identity may follow significantly different unfolding mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In the family of acyl-coenzyme A binding proteins, a subset of 26 sequence sites are identical in all eukaryotes and conserved throughout evolution of the eukaryotic kingdoms. In the context of the bovine protein, the importance of these 26 sequence positions for structure, function, stability, and folding has been analyzed using single-site mutations. A total of 28 mutant proteins were analyzed which covered 17 conserved sequence positions and three nonconserved positions. As a first step, the influence of the mutations on the protein folding reaction has been probed, revealing a folding nucleus of eight hydrophobic residues formed between the N- and C-terminal helices [Kragelund, B. B., et al. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. (In press)]. To fully analyze the role of the conserved residues, the function and the stability have been measured for the same set of mutant proteins. Effects on function were measured by the extent of binding of the ligand dodecanoyl-CoA using isothermal titration calorimetry, and effects on protein stability were measured with chemical denaturation followed by intrinsic tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence. The sequence sites that have been conserved for direct functional purposes have been identified. These are Phe5, Tyr28, Tyr31, Lys32, Lys54, and Tyr73. Binding site residues are mainly polar or charged residues, and together, four of these contribute approximately 8 kcal mol-1 of the total free energy of binding of 11 kcal mol-1. The sequence sites conserved for stability of the structure have likewise been identified and are Phe5, Ala9, Val12, Leu15, Leu25, Tyr28, Lys32, Gln33, Tyr73, Val77, and Leu80. Essentially, all of the conserved residues that maintain the stability are hydrophobic residues at the interface of the helices. Only one conserved polar residue, Gln33, is involved in stability. The results indicate that conservation of residues in homologous proteins may result from a summed optimization of an effective folding reaction, a stable native protein, and a fully active binding site. This is important in protein design strategies, where optimization of one of these parameters, typically function or stability, may influence any of the others markedly.",

        "abstract": "The alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase (alphaTS) from Escherichia coli is a 268-residue 8-stranded beta/alpha barrel protein. Two autonomous folding units, comprising the first six strands (residues 1-188) and the last two strands (residues 189-268), have been previously identified in this single structural domain protein by tryptic digestion [Higgins, W., Fairwell, T., and Miles, E. W. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 4827-4835]. The larger, amino-terminal fragment, alphaTS(1-188), was overexpressed and independently purified, and its equilibrium and kinetic folding properties were studied by absorbance, fluorescence, and near- and far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopies. The native state of the fragment unfolds cooperatively in an apparent two-state transition with a stability of 3.98 +/- 0.19 kcal mol(-1) in the absence of denaturant and a corresponding m value of 1.07 +/- 0.05 kcal mol(-1) M(-1). Similar to the full-length protein, the unfolding of the fragment shows two kinetic phases which arise from the presence of two discrete native state populations. Additionally, the fragment exhibits a significant burst phase in unfolding, indicating that a fraction of the folded state ensemble under native conditions has properties similar to those of the equilibrium intermediate populated at 3 M urea in full-length alphaTS. Refolding of alphaTS(1-188) is also complex, exhibiting two detectable kinetic phases and a burst phase that is complete within 5 ms. The two slowest isomerization phases observed in the refolding of the full-length protein are absent in the fragment, suggesting that these phases reflect contributions from the carboxy-terminal segment. The folding mechanism of alphaTS(1-188) appears to be a simplified version of the mechanism for the full-length protein [Bilsel, O., Zitzewitz, J. A., Bowers, K.E, and Matthews, C. R.(1999) Biochemistry 38, 1018-1029]. Four parallel channels in the full-length protein are reduced to a pair of channels that most likely reflect a cis/trans proline isomerization reaction in the amino-terminal fragment. The off- and on-pathway intermediates that exist for both full-length alphaTS and alphaTS(1-188) may reflect the preponderance of local interactions in the beta/alpha barrel motif.",

        "abstract": "Small autonomously folding proteins are of interest as model systems to study protein folding, as the same molecule can be used for both experimental and computational approaches. The question remains as to how well these minimized peptide model systems represent larger native proteins. For example, is the core of a minimized protein tolerant to mutation like larger proteins are? Also, do minimized proteins use special strategies for specifying and stabilizing their folded structure? Here we examine these questions in the 35-residue autonomously folding villin headpiece subdomain (VHP subdomain). Specifically, we focus on a cluster of three conserved phenylalanine (F) residues F47, F51, and F58, that form most of the hydrophobic core. These three residues are oriented such that they may provide stabilizing aromatic-aromatic interactions that could be critical for specifying the fold. Circular dichroism and 1D-NMR spectroscopy show that point mutations that individually replace any of these three residues with leucine were destabilized, but retained the native VHP subdomain fold. In pair-wise replacements, the double mutant that retains F58 can adopt the native fold, while the two double mutants that lack F58 cannot. The folding of the double mutant that retains F58 demonstrates that aromatic-aromatic interactions within the aromatic cluster are not essential for specifying the VHP subdomain fold. The ability of the VHP subdomain to tolerate mutations within its hydrophobic core indicates that the information specifying the three dimensional structure is distributed throughout the sequence, as observed in larger proteins. Thus, the VHP subdomain is a legitimate model for larger, native proteins.",

Narayana, personal communication) shows a single pore traversing the length of the molecule. Numerous physical and kinetic experiments suggest the pore is the active site. Since the center of the pore possesses exact 222 symmetry, mutagenesis of residues designed to explore substrate binding will probably also affect cofactor binding. As a first step in breaking this inevitable symmetry in R67 DHFR, the gene has been duplicated. The protein product, R67 DHFRdouble, is twice the molecular mass of native R67 DHFR and is fully active with kcat = 1.2 s-1, Km(NADPH) = 2.7 microM and Km(dihydrofolate) = 6.3 microM. Equilibrium unfolding studies in guanidine-HCl indicate R67 DHFRdouble is more stable than native R67 DHFR at physically reasonable protein concentrations. Microcalorimetry studies show native R67 DHFR undergoes fully reversible thermal unfolding. Unfolding can be described by a two-state process since a ratio of delta Hcalorimetric to delta Hvan't Hoff equals 0.96.

A limited number of these molecules have been described, however they typically have not been characterized in depth. In particular, almost no detailed studies of the thermodynamics and folding kinetics of these proteins have been reported. Here we describe detailed studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding of a 39 residue mixed alpha-beta protein (NTL9(1-39)) derived from the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9. The protein folds cooperatively and rapidly in a two-state fashion to a native state typical of those found for normal globular proteins. At pH 5.4 in 20mM sodium acetate, 100mM NaCl the temperature of maximum stability is 6 degrees C, the t(m) is 65.3 degrees C, deltaH degrees (t(m)) is between 24.6 kcalmol(-1) and 26.3 kcalmol(-1), and deltaC(p) degrees is 0.38 kcalmol(-1)deg(-1). The thermodynamic parameters are in the range expected on the basis of per residue values determined from databases of globular proteins. H/2H exchange measurements reveal a set of amides that exchange via global unfolding, exactly as expected for a normal cooperatively folded globular protein. Kinetic measurements show that folding is two-state folding. The folding rate is 640 s(-1) and the value of deltaG degrees calculated from the folding and unfolding rates is in excellent agreement with the equilibrium value. A designed thermostable variant, generated by mutating K12 to M, was characterized and found to have a t(m) of 82 degrees C.

A two-state model postulating a rapid preequilibration of intermediates with the unfolded protein is employed to calculate the stabilization free energy of the intermediate from the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of PPI toward slow folding species. Stability measurements have been made for two distinct slow-folding intermediates: the absorbance-detected (IIS) and fluorescence-detected (IIIS) intermediates. Mutation-induced changes in the stability of the intermediates and in the activation free energy for slow folding are compared to changes in equilibrium thermodynamic stability. The results show that (1) for iso-2 the absorbance-detected intermediates (IIS) are slightly more stable than the fluorescence-detected intermediates (IIIS), (2) most mutations have different effects on equilibrium stability and the stability of the IIS or IIIS intermediates, and (3) for both slow folding reactions the mutation-induced changes in the activation free energy are small compared to the magnitude of the activation free energy barrier. Differential effects of mutations on equilibrium stability and the stability of intermediates provides a means of assessing the sequence-encoded structural specificity for folding. Mutations with different effects on intermediate stability and equilibrium stability change the encoded folding information and may alter folding pathways and/or lead to different three-dimensional structures.

        "abstract": "To elucidate the role of a flexible loop (residues 64-72) in the stability and function of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase, glycine-67 in this loop was substituted by site-directed mutagenesis with seven amino acids (Ala, Cys, Asp, Leu, Ser, Thr, and Val). The circular dichroism spectra suggested that the confirmation of the native structure was affected by the mutations in both the presence and absence of NADPH. The free energy change of unfolding by urea decreased in the order of G67A > G67S > or = wild-type > or = G67D > G67T > G67C > or = G67L > G67V. The steady-state kinetic parameters for the enzyme reaction, Km and kcat, were only slightly influenced, but the rate of the hydride transfer reaction was significantly changed by the mutations, as revealed by the deuterium isotope effect on the enzyme activity. These results suggest that site 67 in the flexible loop, being very far from the active site, plays an important role in the stability and function of this enzyme. The characteristics of the mutations were discussed in terms of the modified flexibility of the native structure, compared with the results of mutations at site 121 in another flexible loop.",

        "abstract": "We have characterized the equilibrium and kinetic folding of a unique protein domain, caspase recruitment domain (CARD), of the RIP-like interacting CLARP kinase (RICK) (RICK-CARD), which adopts a alpha-helical Greek key fold. At equilibrium, the folding of RICK-CARD is well described by a two-state mechanism representing the native and unfolded ensembles. The protein is marginally stable, with a DeltaG(H)()2(O) of 3.0 +/- 0.15 kcal/mol and an m-value of 1.27 +/- 0.06 kcal mol(-1) M(-1) (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM DTT, 25 degrees C). While the m-value is constant, the protein stability decreases in the presence of moderate salt concentrations (below 200 mM) and then increases at higher salt concentrations. The results suggest that electrostatic interactions are stabilizing in the native protein, and the favorable Coulombic interactions are reduced at low ionic strength. Above 200 mM salt, the results are consistent with Hofmeister effects. The unfolding pathway of RICK-CARD is complex and contains at least three non-native conformations. The refolding pathway of RICK-CARD also is complex, and the data suggest that the unfolded protein folds via two intermediate conformations prior to reaching the native state. Overall, the data suggest the presence of kinetically trapped, or misfolded, species that are on-pathway both in refolding and in unfolding.",

Because the cDNA sequence of the protein has not yet been determined, a 400 base-pair gene encoding canine milk lysozyme was first designed on the basis of the known amino acid sequence. The gene was constructed by an enzymatic assembly of 21 chemically synthesized oligonucleotides and inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector by stepwise ligation. The expression plasmid thus constructed was transformed into BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells. The gene product accumulated as inclusion bodies in an insoluble fraction. Recombinant canine milk lysozyme was obtained by purification and refolding of the product and showed the same characteristics in terms of bacteriolytic activity and far- and near-UV circular dichroism spectra as the authentic protein. The NMR spectra of refolded lysozyme were also characteristic of a native globular protein. It was concluded that recombinant canine milk lysozyme was folded into the correct native structure. Moreover, the thermal unfolding profiles of the refolded recombinant lysozyme showed a stable equilibrium intermediate, indicating that the molten globule state of this protein was extraordinarily stable. This expression system of canine milk lysozyme will enable biophysical and structural studies of this protein to be extended.",

        "abstract": "The melting of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) has been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. At neutral pH, rtPA melts with only partial reversibility in a single sharp peak that can be deconvoluted into four transitions. By contrast, at acidic pH the melting process is spread over a broad range of temperature and is highly reversible. Under these conditions five transitions are resolved by deconvolution analysis. Additional measurements in 6 M guanidinium chloride reveal a sixth transition representing an extremely stable domain. Comparison of the melting curves of several fragments with those of the parent protein allowed all of the transitions to be assigned. The results indicate that rtPA is comprised of six independently folded domains. Two of these domains correspond to the two kringle modules whose thermodynamic properties are similar to those of the kringles in plasminogen. Two additional domains are formed by the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and finger modules, the latter of which is extremely stable, requiring the presence of a chemical denaturant for its melting to be observed. The serine protease module contains two more domains which at neutral pH melt cooperatively in a single transition but at low pH melt independently, accounting for the greater number of transitions observed there. Measurements with a 50-kDa fragment lacking the C-terminal half of the serine protease module and with a variant lacking the finger and EGF domains indicate that the serine protease domains interact strongly with and are stabilized by the finger and/or EGF domains in the intact protein. This interaction between domains located at opposite ends of the rtPA molecule produces a more compact structure. A better understanding of such interactions may enhance efforts to engineer plasminogen activators with improved thrombolytic properties.",

This comparison of the two related proteins allows us to distinguish any anomalous response to mutation. Although they have very similar structures, the effect of mutation is very different. TNfn3 behaves like a \"typical\" protein, with changes in free energy correlated to the number of contacts lost on mutation. The loss of free energy upon mutation is significantly lower for FNfn10, particularly mutations of residues in the A, B and G strands. Remarkably, some of the residues involved are completely buried and closely packed in the core. In FNfn10 the regions of the protein that can accommodate mutation have previously been shown to be mobile. We propose that there is a \"plasticity\" in the peripheral regions of FNfn10 that allows it to rearrange to minimise the effect of mutations. This study emphasises the difficulties that might arise when making generalisations from a single member of a protein family.",

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), we have examined the effect of this mutation on the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates of several backbone amide protons in the native and engineered proteins at 50 degrees C. These exchange rates provide a localized probe at multiple discrete sites throughout the protein and from comparison of native and mutant exchange rates allow calculation of the difference in free energy of exchange (delta delta Gex) resulting from the mutation. The results show that for the majority of amides observed this mutation results in delta delta Gex of ca. 1.7 kcal mol-1 over the whole CI-2 molecule. However, for two relatively exposed amide protons the exchange rates are found to be far less perturbed, implying that local unfolding mechanisms predominate for these protons. Direct measurement of the stability of both proteins to denaturation by guanidinum hydrochloride shows that the interaction contributes 1.4 kcal mol-1 to the stability of the molecule. This value is comparable to those obtained from the NMR exchange measurements and indicates that the exchange processes reflect the differences in stability between the native and mutant proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Disulfide bonds in a folding protein chain are equivalent to prematurely formed native-like tertiary interactions. We investigated whether the mechanism of protein folding is changed by the presence of disulfide bonds. As a model we used the S54G/P55N-variant of ribonuclease T1, a protein with two disulfide bonds and a single cis proline (Pro39), and we measured both the direct and the proline-limited folding reactions before and after breaking of the disulfide bonds. The folding kinetics were compared under refolding conditions, in the regions of the urea-induced unfolding transitions of the two forms, and under unfolding conditions. The kinetics in the transition regions were analyzed on the basis of a three-species mechanism and all microscopic rate constants of folding and of prolyl isomerization could be determined as a function of the urea concentration from the measured rates and amplitudes. These kinetic analyses indicated that the disulfide bonds can be rather unfavorable for the folding of S54G/P55N-ribonuclease T1. Under strongly native conditions they retard the rate-limiting trans-->cis isomerization of Pro39 because they allow the rapid formation of partially ordered structure prior to the proline-limited refolding reaction. Under unfolding conditions the isomerization of Pro39 is not affected. The direct unfolding and refolding reactions in the transition region of polypeptide chains with correct prolyl isomers are also decelerated when the disulfide bonds are present. These changes in the folding kinetics are possibly related to the decrease in chain flexibility that is caused by the disulfide bonds. A high flexibility is probably important throughout folding, and in the case of ribonuclease T1 a premature locking of tertiary contacts by intact disulfide bonds can interfere unfavorably with both the direct and the proline-limited folding reactions.",

        "abstract": "Arc repressor is a small, dimeric DNA-binding protein that belongs to the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors. Replacing Pro8 at the N-terminal end of the beta-sheet with leucine increases the stability of the mutant protein by 2.5 kcal/mol of dimer. However, this enhanced stability is achieved at the expense of significantly reduced DNA binding affinity. The structure of the PL8 mutant dimer has been determined to 2.4-A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The overall structure of the mutant is very similar to wild type, but Leu8 makes an additional interstrand hydrogen bond at each end of the beta-sheet of the mutant, increasing the total number of beta-sheet hydrogen bonds from six to eight. Comparison of the refolding and unfolding kinetics of the PL8 mutant and wild-type Arc shows that the enhanced stability of the mutant is accounted for by a decrease in the rate of protein unfolding, suggesting that the mutation acts to stabilize the native state and that the beta-sheet forms after the rate-limiting step in folding. The reduced operator affinity of the PL8 dimer appears to arise because the mutant cannot make the new interstrand hydrogen bonds and simultaneously make the wild-type set of contacts with operator DNA.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding and refolding of a derivative of alpha-lactalbumin, in which the disulfide bond between Cys6 and Cys120 is selectively reduced and S-carboxymethylated, are investigated by equilibrium and kinetic circular dichroism measurements. The native conformation of this derivative is known to be essentially identical to that of intact alpha-lactalbumin. The equilibrium unfolding of the derivative involves a stable intermediate, which is also similar to the molten globule state of the disulfide intact protein. The results of stopped-flow circular dichroism experiments show that the same intermediate is formed rapidly as a transient intermediate in kinetic refolding. The conformational stabilities for the native and intermediate states have been estimated and compared with the stabilities for the corresponding states of intact alpha-lactalbumin. The stabilization of the native state by the disulfide has been interpreted in terms of a decrease in chain entropy in the unfolded state and elimination of the strain imposed on the disulfide bond in the native state. The molten globule state is also stabilized by the disulfide bond, although the degree of stabilization of the molten globule state is smaller than of the native state. The results suggest that, in the molten globule state, some ordered structures are present within the loop moiety formed by the 6-120 disulfide.",

        "abstract": "Irreversibility of thermally denatured proteins due to aggregation limits thermodynamic characterization of proteins and also confounds the identification of thermostable mutants in protein populations. Identification of mutations that prevent the aggregation of unfolded proteins provides insights into folding pathways. In a lipase from Bacillus subtilis, evolved by directed evolution procedures, the irreversibility due to temperature-mediated aggregation was completely prevented by a single mutation, M137P. Though the parent and the mutants unfold completely on heating, mutants having substitutions M137P, along with M134E and S163P, completely or partially prevent the formation of aggregation-prone intermediate(s) at 75 degrees C. The three mutants show only a marginal increase in free energy of unfolding (DeltaG(H(2)O)), however, the profiles of the residual activity with temperature shows remarkable shift to higher temperature compared to parent. The intermediate(s) were characterized by enhanced binding of bis-ANS, a probe to titrate surface hydrophobicity, aggregation profiles and by estimation of soluble protein. Inclusion of salt in the refolding conditions prevents the reversibility of mutant having charge substitution, while the reversibility of mutant with the introduction of proline was unaffected, indicating the role of charge mediated interaction in M134E in preventing aggregation. Partial prevention of thermal aggregation in wild-type lipase with single substitution, M137P, incorporated by site-directed mutagenesis, suggests that the affect of M137P is independent of the intrinsic thermostability of lipase. Various effects of the mutations suggest their role is in prevention of the formation of aggregation prone intermediate(s). These mutations, describe yet another strategy to enhance the thermotolerance of proteins, where their influence is observed only on the denatured ensemble.",

        "abstract": "Factor for inversion stimulation (FIS) is a 22 kDa homodimeric protein found in enteric bacteria that is involved in the stimulation of certain DNA recombination events and transcription regulation of many genes. FIS has a central helix with a 20 degrees kink, which is only reduced by 4 degrees after a proline 61 to alanine mutation (P61A). This mutation appears to have little effect on FIS function, yet it is striking that proline 61 is highly conserved among fis genes. Therefore, we studied the role of proline 61 on the stability and flexibility of FIS. The urea-induced equilibrium denaturation of P61A FIS was monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence anisotropy. Despite the apparent two-state transition, the concentration dependence of the transition slope (m value) shows that a two-state model, as seen for wild-type (WT) FIS, did not adequately describe the denaturation of P61A FIS. Global fitting of the data indicates that the denaturation of P61A FIS occurs via a three-state process involving a dimeric intermediate and has an overall DeltaG(H2O) for unfolding of 18.6 kcal/mol, 4 kcal/mol higher than that for WT FIS. Limited trypsin proteolysis experiments show that the DNA binding C-terminus of P61A FIS is more labile to cleavage than that of WT FIS, suggesting an increased flexibility of this region in P61A FIS. In contrast, the resulting dimeric core (residues 6-71) of P61A FIS is more resistant to proteolysis, consistent with the presence of a dimeric intermediate not seen in WT FIS. Model transition curves generated using the parameters obtained by global fitting predicted a two-state-like transition at low P61A concentrations that becomes less cooperative with increasing protein concentration, as was experimentally observed. At concentrations of P61A FIS much higher than are experimentally feasible, a biphasic transition is predicted. Thus, this work demonstrates that a single mutation may be sufficient to alter a protein's denaturation mechanism and underscores the importance of analyzing the denaturation mechanism of oligomeric proteins over a wide concentration range. These results suggest that proline 61 in FIS may be conserved in order to optimize the global stability and the dynamics of the functionally important C-terminus.",

A difference in the resistance of the proteins to denaturants such as guanidine HCl and urea was revealed; the wild-type protein always proved to be the most resistant.

        "abstract": "In order to probe the relative contribution of local and non-local interactions to the thermodynamic stability of proteins, we have devised an experimental approach based on a combination of motif engineering and sequence shuffling. Candidate chain segments in an immunoglobulin V(L) domain were identified whose conformation is proposed to be dominated by non-local interactions. Locally interacting structural motifs of a different conformation were then constructed as replacements, by introducing motif consensus sequences. We find that all nine replacements we constructed systematically reduce the folding cooperativity. By comparing this destabilising effect with the folding transitions of shuffled sequences for three of these motifs, we estimate the contribution of local, native interactions to the free energy of folding. Our results suggest that local and non-local interactions contribute to stability by an approximately equal amount, but that local interactions stabilise by increasing the resistance to denaturation while non-local interactions increase folding cooperativity. The systematic loss of stability by sequence shuffling in these host-guest experiments suggests that the designed interactions indeed are present in the native state, thus consensus sequence engineering may be a useful tool in structure design, but non-local interactions must be taken into account for global stability engineering. Statistical approaches are powerful tools for engineering protein structure and stability, but an analysis based on local sequence propensities alone does not adequately represent the balance of sequence and context in protein structures.",

        "abstract": "The equilibrium denaturation and unfolding kinetics of the domains V(L) and V(H) have been compared with those of the Fv and single-chain Fv (scFv) fragment of an engineered variant of the antibody McPC603 in the presence and absence of the antigen phosphorylcholine. The scFv fragment is significantly more stable than the isolated constituting domains. Antigen binding stabilizes the heterodimeric assembly even further. Domain dissociation and domain unfolding are coupled processes, giving rise to a highly cooperative unfolding transition. For the Fv fragment, cooperative unfolding is only observed in the presence of antigen. At low protein concentrations and in the absence of antigen, the Fv fragment is significantly destabilized, leading to quantitative domain dissociation before significant domain unfolding takes place. The kinetic unfolding of V(H), V(L) and the scFv fragment is monophasic. Unfolding of the scFv fragment is much slower, when extrapolated to zero denaturant, than either of the isolated domains, suggesting that the higher thermodynamic stability of the scFv fragment is at least partially due to a high-energy transition state for unfolding. These studies emphasize the enormous importance of mutual domain stabilization in engineering stable antibodies.",

        "abstract": "The amino terminal domain of enzyme I (residues 1-258 + Arg; EIN) and full length enzyme I (575 residues; EI) harboring active-site mutations (H189E, expected to have properties of phosphorylated forms, and H189A) have been produced by protein bioengineering. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-induced changes in ellipticity at 222 nm for monomeric wild-type and mutant EIN proteins indicate two-state unfolding. For EIN proteins in 10 mM K-phosphate (and 100 mM KCl) at pH 7.5, deltaH approximately 140 +/- 10 (160) kcal mol(-1) and deltaCp approximately 2.7 (3.3) kcal K(-1) mol(-1). Transition temperatures (Tm) are 57 (59), 55 (58), and 53 (56) degrees C for wild-type, H189A, and H189E forms of EIN, respectively. The order of conformational stability for dephospho-His189, phospho-His189, and H189 substitutions of EIN at pH 7.5 is: His > Ala > Glu > His-PO3(2-) due to differences in conformational entropy. Although H189E mutants have decreased Tm values for overall unfolding the amino terminal domain, a small segment of structure (3 to 12%) is stabilized (Tm approximately 66-68 degrees C). This possibly arises from an ion pair interaction between the gamma-carboxyl of Glu189 and the epsilon-amino group of Lys69 in the docking region for the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein HPr. However, the binding of HPr to wild-type and active-site mutants of EIN and EI is temperature-independent (entropically controlled) with about the same affinity constant at pH 7.5: K(A)' = 3 +/- 1 x 10(5) M(-1) for EIN and approximately 1.2 x 10(5) M(-1) for EI.",

        "abstract": "A variety of techniques have been used to investigate the urea-induced kinetic folding mechanism of the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase from Escherichia coli. A distinctive property of this 29 kDa alpha/beta barrel protein is the presence of two stable equilibrium intermediates, populated at approximately 3 and 5 M urea. The refolding process displays multiple kinetic phases whose lifetimes span the submillisecond to greater than 100 s time scale; unfolding studies yield two relaxation times on the order of 10-100 s. In an effort to understand the populations and structural properties of both the stable and transient intermediates, stopped-flow, manual-mixing, and equilibrium circular dichroism data were globally fit to various kinetic models. Refolding and unfolding experiments from various initial urea concentrations as well as forward and reverse double-jump experiments were critical for model discrimination. The simplest kinetic model that is consistent with all of the available data involves four slowly interconverting unfolded forms that collapse within 5 ms to a marginally stable intermediate with significant secondary structure. This early intermediate is an off-pathway species that must unfold to populate a set of four on-pathway intermediates that correspond to the 3 M urea equilibrium intermediate. Reequilibrations among these conformers act as rate-limiting steps in folding for a majority of the population. A fraction of the native conformation appears in less than 1 s at 25 degrees C, demonstrating that even large proteins can rapidly traverse a complex energy surface.",

        "abstract": "As part of a program to discover improved glycoside hydrolase family 12 (GH 12) endoglucanases, we have studied the biochemical diversity of several GH 12 homologs. The H. schweinitzii Cel12A enzyme differs from the T. reesei Cel12A enzyme by only 14 amino acids (93% sequence identity), but is much less thermally stable. The bacterial Cel12A enzyme from S. sp. 11AG8 shares only 28% sequence identity to the T. reesei enzyme, and is much more thermally stable. Each of the 14 sequence differences from H. schweinitzii Cel12A were introduced in T. reesei Cel12A to determine the effect of these amino acid substitutions on enzyme stability. Several of the T. reesei Cel12A variants were found to have increased stability, and the differences in apparent midpoint of thermal denaturation (T(m)) ranged from a 2.5 degrees C increase to a 4.0 degrees C decrease. The least stable recruitment from H. schweinitzii Cel12A was A35S. Consequently, the A35V substitution was recruited from the more stable S. sp. 11AG8 Cel12A and this T. reesei Cel12A variant was found to have a T(m) 7.7 degrees C higher than wild type. Thus, the buried residue at position 35 was shown to be of critical importance for thermal stability in this structural family. There was a ninefold range in the specific activities of the Cel12 homologs on o-NPC. The most and least stable T. reesei Cel12A variants, A35V and A35S, respectively, were fully active. Because of their thermal tolerance, S. sp. 11AG8 Cel12A and T. reesei Cel12A variant A35V showed a continual increase in activity over the temperature range of 25 degrees C to 60 degrees C, whereas the less stable enzymes T. reesei Cel12A wild type and the destabilized A35S variant, and H. schweinitzii Cel12A showed a decrease in activity at the highest temperatures. The crystal structures of the H. schweinitzii, S. sp. 11AG8, and T. reesei A35V Cel12A enzymes have been determined and compared with the wild-type T. reesei Cel12A enzyme. All of the structures have similar Calpha traces, but provide detailed insight into the nature of the stability differences. These results are an example of the power of homolog recruitment as a method for identifying residues important for stability.",

        "abstract": "Hydrophobic residues in the core of a truncated form of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) have been mutated in order to measure their contribution to the stability of the protein. The free energy of unfolding of wild-type and mutants was measured by both guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation and differential scanning calorimetry. The two methods give results for the changes in free energy on mutation that agree to within 1% or 2%. The average change in the free energy of unfolding (+/- standard deviation) for an Ile-->Val mutation is 1.2 +/- 0.1 kcal mol-1, for a Val-->Ala mutation 3.4 +/- 1.5 kcal mol-1, and for either an Ile-->Ala or a Leu-->Ala mutation 3.6 +/- 0.6 kcal mol-1. This gives an average change in the free energy of unfolding for deleting one methylene group of 1.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol-1. Two significant correlations were found between the change in the free energy of unfolding between wild-type and mutant, delta delta GU-F, and the environment of the mutated residue in the protein. The first is between delta delta GU-F and the difference in side-chain solvent-accessible area buried between wild-type and mutant (correlation coefficient = 0.81, 10 points). The second and slightly better correlation was found between delta delta GU-F and N, the number of methyl/methylene groups within a 6-A radius of the hydrophobic group deleted (correlation coefficient = 0.84, 10 points). The latter correlation is very similar to that found previously for barnase, suggesting that this relationship is general and applies to the hydrophobic cores of other globular proteins. The combined data for C12 and barnase clearly show a better correlation with N (correlation coefficient = 0.87, 30 points) than with the change in the solvent-accessible surface area (correlation coefficient = 0.82, 30 points). This indicates that the packing density around a particular residue is important in determining the contribution the residue makes to protein stability. In one case, Ile-->Val76, a mutation which deletes the C delta 1 methyl group of a buried side chain, a surprising result was obtained. This mutant was found to be more stable than wild-type by 0.2 +/- 0.1 kcal mol-1. We have solved and analyzed the crystal structure of this mutant and find that there are small movements of side chains in the core, the largest of which, 0.7 A, is a movement of the side chain that has been mutated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "In a comparative investigation on two thermostable alpha-amylases [Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BAA), T(m) = 86 degrees C and Bacillus licheniformis (BLA), T(m) = 101 degrees C], we studied thermal and guanidine hydrochloride (GndHCl)-induced unfolding using fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, as well as dynamic light scattering. Depletion of calcium from specific ion-binding sites in the protein structures reduces the melting temperature tremendously for both alpha-amylases. The reduction is nearly the same for both enzymes, namely, in the order of 50 degrees C. Thus, the difference in thermostability between BLA and BAA (DeltaT(m) approximately 15 degrees C) is related to intrinsic properties of the respective protein structures themselves and is not related to the strength of ion binding. The thermal unfolding of both proteins is characterized by a full disappearance of secondary structure elements and by a concurrent expansion of the 3D structure. GndHCl-induced unfolding also yields a fully vanishing secondary structure but with more expanded 3D structures. Both alpha-amylases remain much more compact upon thermal unfolding as compared to the fully unfolded state induced by chemical denaturants. Such rather compact thermal unfolded structures lower the conformational entropy change during the unfolding transition, which principally can contribute to an increased thermal stability. Structural flexibilities of both enzymes, as measured with tryptophan fluorescence quenching, are almost identical for both enzymes in the native states, as well as in the unfolded states. Furthermore, we do not observe any difference in the temperature dependence of the structural flexibilities between BLA and BAA. These results indicate that conformational dynamics on the time scale of our studies seem not to be related to thermal stability or to thermal adaptation.",

The results show that the thermal stability of RNase A decreases with increasing concentration of denaturants and the size of the hydrophobic group substituted on the urea molecule. From CD measurements in the near- and far-UV range, it has been observed that the tertiary structure of RNase A melts at about 3 degrees C lower temperature than its secondary structure, which means that the hierarchy in structural building blocks exists for RNase A even at conditions at which according to DSC and UV measurements the RNase A unfolding can be interpreted in terms of a two-state approximation. The far-UV CD spectra also show that the final denatured states of RNase A at high temperatures in the presence of different denaturants including 4.5 M GuHCl are similar to each other but different from the one obtained in 4.5 M GuHCl at 25 degrees C. The concentration dependence of the preferential solvation change delta r23, expressed as the number of cosolvent molecules entering or leaving the solvation shell of the protein upon denaturation and calculated from DSC data, shows the same relative denaturation efficiency of alkylureas as other methods.",

        "abstract": "Temperature-induced unfolding of the leucine zipper, an alpha-helical, double-stranded, coiled-coil, was studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry and heat capacity scanning calorimetry. It is shown that this process does not represent a simple two-state transition, as previously believed, but consists of several stages. The first transition starts at the very beginning of heating from 0 degrees C and proceeds with significant heat absorption and decrease of ellipticity. This transition does not depend on the concentration of protein and is sensitive to modification of the N terminus; it is therefore associated with unfolding or fraying of this part of the leucine zipper. The second transition takes place at a considerably higher temperature; it is more pronounced than the first one and does not depend on the concentration of protein, i.e. it is unimolecular. This transition is sensitive to modification of both termini of the leucine zipper and affects the optical properties of a tryptophan residue placed in the central part of the zipper. It therefore involves the whole dimer but does not result in its dissociation, presumably being associated with some repacking of the coiled-coil. This second transition is followed at higher temperatures by the concentration-dependent cooperative unfolding/dissociation of the two strands. The enthalpy and entropy of the temperature-induced structural changes of the leucine zipper that take place before its cooperative unfolding/dissociation comprises almost 40% of the total enthalpy and entropy of unfolding of the completely folded coiled-coil, the state in which it appears to be below 0 degrees C. Comparison of the total enthalpy of leucine zipper unfolding with that of a single-stranded alpha-helix shows that their temperature-dependence correlates with the extent of intramolecular non-polar contacts and allows an assessment of the enthalpy of hydrogen bonding in alpha-helices, which appears to be about 3.3kJmol(-1) at 20 degrees C.",

Apart from its crucial functions in intracellular amino acid metabolism, ACYI also has substantial commercial importance for the optical resolution of N-acylated DL-amino acids. As a zinc-dependent enzyme, ACYI is quite stable against heat-induced denaturation and can be regarded as a thermostable enzyme with an optimal temperature for activity of approximately 65 degrees C. In this research, the sequential events in ACYI thermal denaturation were investigated by a combination of spectroscopic methods and related resolution-enhancing techniques. Interestingly, the results from fluorescence and infrared (IR) spectroscopy clearly indicated that a pretransitional stage existed at temperatures from 50 degrees C to 66 degrees C. The thermal unfolding of ACYI might be a three-state process involving an aggregation-prone intermediate appearing at approximately 68 degrees C. The pretransitional structural changes involved the partial unfolding of the solvent-exposed beta-sheet structures and the transformation of about half of the Class I Trp fluorophores to Class II. Our results also suggested that the usage of resolution-enhancing techniques could provide valuable information of the step-wise unfolding of proteins.",

        "abstract": "Decorsin is a 39-residue polypeptide chain, crosslinked by three disulfide bridges, that strongly inhibits platelet aggregation. We report the chemical synthesis and characterization of analogs of decorsin with the aim of investigating the role of proline residues in protein structure, stability and biological activity. Decorsin analogs have been synthesized in which one (P23A and P24A decorsin) or two (P23,24A decorsin) proline residues have been substituted by alanine. The crude synthetic polypeptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC in their reduced form and allowed to refold oxidatively to their disulfide-crosslinked species. The homogeneity of the synthetic mini-proteins, and also the correct pairing of the three disulfide bridges, were established by a number of analytical criteria, including fingerprinting analysis of the refolded synthetic analogs by using thermolysin and proteinase K as proteolytic enzymes. Replacement of proline by alanine results in a significant and cumulative decrease of the high thermal stability (Tm 74 degrees C) of native decorsin. The mono-substituted analogs display a Tm of 66-67 degrees C, while the double-substituted analog a Tm of 50 degrees C. On the other hand, the overall secondary and tertiary structures were not affected by the Pro-->Ala exchanges, as judged from circular dichroism measurements. Platelet aggregation assays established that the proline substitutions do not impair significantly the biological activity of decorsin. The results of this study clearly indicate that proline residues contribute significantly to the protein thermal stability. Our results are in line with the 'proline rule', previously advanced for explaining the unusual thermal stability of thermophilic enzymes, which usually show an enhanced content of proline residues with respect to their mesophilic counterparts.",

        "abstract": "The bacterial cold shock proteins (Csp) are used by both experimentalists and theoreticians as model systems for analyzing the Coulombic contributions to protein stability. We employ Proside, a method of directed evolution, to identify stabilized variants of Bs-CspB from Bacillus subtilis. Proside links the increased protease resistance of stabilized protein variants to the infectivity of a filamentous phage. Here, three cspB libraries were used for in vitro selections to explore the stabilizing potential of charged amino acids in Bs-CspB. In the first library codons for nine selected surface residues were partially randomized, in the second one random mutations were introduced non-specifically by error-prone PCR, and in the third one the spontaneous mutation rate of the phage in Escherichia coli was used. Stabilizing mutations were found at the surface positions 1, 3, 46, 48, 65, and 66. The contributions of these mutations to stability were characterized by analyzing them individually and in combination. The best combination (M1R, E3K, K65I, and E66L) increased the midpoint of thermal unfolding of Bs-CspB from 53.8 to 85.0 degrees C. The effects of most mutations are strongly context dependent. A good example is provided by the E3R mutation. It is strongly stabilizing (DeltaDeltaGD=11.1kJ mol(-1)) in the wild-type protein, but destabilizing (DeltaDeltaGD=-4.0kJ mol(-1)) in the A46K/S48R/E66L variant. The stabilizations by charge mutations did not correlate well with the corresponding changes in the protein net charge, and they could not be ascribed to the formation of ion pairs. Previous theoretical analyses did not identify the stabilization caused by the mutations at positions 1, 46, and 48. Also, electrostatics calculations based on protein net charge or charge asymmetry did not predict well the stability changes that occur when charged residues in Bs-CspB are mutated. It remains a challenge to model the Coulombic interactions of charged residues in a protein and to determine their contributions to the Gibbs free energy of protein folding.",

        "abstract": "In an attempt to identify a systematic relation between the structure of a protein and its folding kinetics, the rate of folding was determined for 20 mutants of T4 lysozyme in which a bulky, buried, nonpolar wild-type residue (Leu, Ile, Phe, Val, or Met) was substituted with alanine. Methionine, which approximated the size of the original side chain but which is of different shape and flexibility, was also substituted at most of the same sites. Mutations that substantially destabilize the protein and are located in the carboxy-terminal domain generally slow the rate of folding. Destabilizing mutations in the amino-terminal domain, however, have little effect on the rate of folding. Mutations that have little effect on stability tend to have little effect on the rate, no matter where they are located. These results suggest that, at the rate-limiting step, elements of structure in the C-terminal domain are formed and have a structure similar to that of the fully folded protein. Consistent with this, two variants that somewhat increase the rate of folding (Phe104 --> Met and Val149 --> Met) are located within the carboxy-terminal domain and maintain or improve packing with very little perturbation of the wild-type structure.",

        "abstract": "Aspartic acid 26 in Escherichia coli thioredoxin is located at the bottom of a hydrophobic cavity, near the redox-active disulfide of the active site. Asp 26 is embedded in the protein except for part of the surface of one carboxyl oxygen. The high degree of evolutionary conversion of Asp 26 suggests that it plays a critical role in thioredoxin function. We have determined the pKa of Asp 26 by a novel electrophoretic method based on the relative electrophoretic mobilities of wild-type thioredoxin and of D26A thioredoxin (with Asp 26 replaced by alanine). The pKa of Asp 26 determined by this technique is 7.5, more than 3 units above the pKa of a solvated carboxyl side chain. The titration of Asp 26 is thermodynamically linked to the stability of thioredoxin. As expected if thioredoxin stability depends on the ionization state of Asp 26, delta Go WT, the free energy of the cooperative denaturation reaction of wild-type thioredoxin by guanidine hydrochloride, varies with pH in a sigmoidal fashion in the vicinity of pH 7.5. Over the same pH range, the free energy for D26A folding, delta Go D26A, is pH independent and D26A is highly stabilized compared to wild type. From the thermodynamic cycle describing the linkage of Asp 26 titration to thioredoxin stability, the difference in free energy between wild-type thioredoxin with protonated Asp 26 and wild-type thioredoxin with deprotonated Asp 26, delta delta Go (COOH----COO-), is calculated to be 4.9 kcal/mol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Ribonuclease HII from hyperthermophile Thermococcus kodakaraensis (Tk-RNase HII) is a kinetically robust monomeric protein. The conformational stability and folding kinetics of Tk-RNase HII were measured for nine mutant proteins in which a buried larger hydrophobic side chain is replaced by a smaller one (Leu/Ile to Ala). The mutant proteins were destabilized by 8.9 to 22.0 kJ mol(-1) as compared with the wild-type protein. The removal of each -CH(2)- group burial decreased the stability by 5.1 kJ mol(-1) on average in the mutant proteins of Tk-RNase HII examined. This is comparable with the value of 5.3 kJ mol(-1) obtained from experiments for proteins from organisms growing at moderate temperature. We conclude that the hydrophobic residues buried inside protein molecules contribute to the stabilization of hyperthermophilic proteins to a similar extent as proteins at normal temperature. In the folding experiments, the mutant proteins of Tk-RNase HII examined exhibited faster unfolding compared with the wild-type protein. These results indicate that the buried hydrophobic residues strongly contribute to the kinetic robustness of Tk-RNase HII.

        "abstract": "The conformational transition observed upon addition of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) to solutions of oxidized Escherichia coli thioredoxin is dominated by a slow kinetic phase (time constant tau 1 = 300-800 s) that has features appropriate to a proline peptide isomerization. This observation has been interpreted as reflecting a folding pathway involving an obligatory isomerization of the imide peptide bond between isoleucine-75 and proline-76 [Kelley, R. F., & Stellwagen, E. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5095-5102]; this peptide bond is known to have the cis configuration in the folded state [Eklund, H., Cambillan, C., Sj\u00f6berg, B.-M., Holmgren, A., J\u00f6rnvall, H., H\u00f6\u00f6g, J.-O., & Br\u00e4nd\u00e9n, C.-I. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 1443-1449]. We have tested this hypothesis by examining the conformational transitions of two thioredoxin mutants, trxA76 having an alanine substituted for proline-76 and trxA2 [Russel, M., & Model, P. (1983) J. Bacteriol. 154, 1064-1070] having proline-34 replaced with serine. Both mutant proteins display far-ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra similar to that of native wild-type thioredoxin. The tryptophan fluorescence emission of native trxA2 is equivalent to that of wild-type thioredoxin, while the emission intensity of native trxA76 at 350 nm is 2-fold greater. Tryptophan fluorescence and peptide ellipticity measurements indicate that the mutant proteins undergo two-state and reversible equilibrium unfolding transitions upon addition of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl). These transitions are centered at 2.4 and 1.5 M Gdn-HCl for trxA2 and trxA76, respectively, as compared to a midpoint of 2.5 M denaturant for wild-type thioredoxin. As observed for wild-type thioredoxin, fluorescence measurements reveal monophasic unfolding kinetics for trxA2 at a variety of final denaturant concentrations. The tau for unfolding varies monotonically from 210 s in 2.4 M Gdn-HCl to 7 s for a final Gdn-HCl concentration of 3.5 M. Refolding of denatured trxA2 in 1.5 M Gdn-HCl detected by fluorescence measurements is described by three kinetic phases with time constants and fractional amplitudes (alpha) similar to those of wild-type thioredoxins. The fractional amplitude (alpha 1) of the slowest of these phases, tau 1 = 430 +/- 38 s in 2.0 M Gdn-HCl, decreases with final Gdn-HCl concentration. Multimixing experiments suggest that this phase results from an equilibration between denatured forms and has a tau of 34 s in 4 M denaturant, features previously observed for the wild-type protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

His274 and Asp375 are conserved active-site residues in pig citrate synthase that bind to substrates and are implicated in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. By site-directed mutagenesis, His274 was replaced with Gly and Arg, while Asp375 was replaced with Gly, Asn, Glu, or Gln. These modifications were previously shown to result in 10(3)-10(4)-fold reductions in enzyme specific activities. The thermal unfolding of pig citrate synthase and the six mutants in the presence and absence of substrates showed large differences in the thermal stabilities of mutant proteins compared to the wild-type pig citrate synthase. The functions of His274 and Asp375 in ligand binding were measured by oxalacetate protection against urea denaturation. These data indicate that active-site mutations that decrease the specific activity of pig citrate synthase also cause an increase in the conformational stability of the protein. These results suggest that specific electrostatic interactions in the active site of citrate synthase are important in the catalytic mechanism in the chemical transformations as well as the conformational flexibility of the protein, both of which are important for the overall catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Dodecameric glutamine synthetase (GS) from Escherichia coli undergoes reversible, thermally induced partial unfolding without subunit dissociation. A single endotherm for Mn.GS (+/- active-site ligands) in the presence of 1 mM free Mn2+ and 100 mM KCl at pH 7 is observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Previous deconvolutions of DSC data for Mn.GS showed only two two-state transitions (with similar tm values; 51.6 +/- 2 degrees C), and indicated that cooperative interactions link partial unfolding reactions of all subunits within the Mn.enzyme dodecamer [Ginsburg, A., & Zolkiewski, M. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9421]. A net uptake of 8.0 equiv of H+ by Mn.GS occurs during partial unfolding, as determined in the present DSC experiments conducted with four buffers having different heats of protonation at 50 degrees C. These data gave a value of 176 +/- 12 kcal (mol of dodecamer)-1 for delta Hcal corrected for buffer protonation. L-Glutamine and L-Met-(SR)-sulfoximine stabilize the Mn.GS dodecamer through the free energies of ligand binding, and these were shown to be partially and totally released, respectively, from the 12 active sites at high temperature. Ligand effects on Tm values from DSC were similar to those from spectral measurements of Trp and Tyr exposures in two subunit domains. Effects of varying [ADP] on DSC profiles of Mn.GS were complex; Tm is increased by low [ADP] and decreased by > 100 microM free ADP. This is due to the exposure of an additional low-affinity ADP binding site per GS subunit at high temperature with log K1' = 4.3 and log K2' = 3.6 at 60 degrees C relative to log K' = 5.5 for ADP binding at 30 degrees C, as determined by isothermal calorimetric and fluorescence titrations. Moreover, delta Hcal at > 27% saturation with ADP (corrected for ADP binding/dissociation) is approximately 80-100 kcal/mol more than in the absence of ligands. Changes in domain interactions could result from ADP bridging subunit contacts in the dodecamer. Each of the active-site ligands investigated here produces different effects on DSC profiles without uncoupling the extremely cooperative, partial unfolding reactions in the Mn.GS dodecamer.",

Three valines that cluster together in the major hydrophobic core of T1 were each replaced with Ala, Ser, Thr, and Cys. Compared to the wild-type protein, all these mutants reduce the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme considerably. The relative order of stability at all three positions is as follows: Val > Ala approximately equal to Thr > Ser. The effect of introducing a sulfhydryl group is more variable. Surprisingly, a Val --> Cys mutation in a hydrophobic environment can be as or even more destabilizing than a Val --> Ser mutation. Furthermore, our results reveal that the penalty for introducing an OH group into a hydrophobic cavity is roughly the same as the gain obtained from filling the cavity with a CH(3) group. The inverse equivalence of the behavior of hydroxyl and methyl groups seems to be crucial for the unique three-dimensional structure of the proteins. The importance of negative design elements in this context is highlighted.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the consequences of macromolecular crowding on the behavior of a globular protein, we performed a combined experimental and computational study on the 148-residue single-domain alpha/beta protein, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin. In vitro thermal unfolding experiments, as well as assessment of native and denatured structures, were probed by using far-UV CD in the presence of various amounts of Ficoll 70, an inert spherical crowding agent. Ficoll 70 has a concentration-dependent effect on the thermal stability of apoflavodoxin (DeltaT(m) of 20 degrees C at 400 mg/ml; pH 7). As judged by CD, addition of Ficoll 70 causes an increase in the amount of secondary structure in the native-state ensemble (pH 7, 20 degrees C) but only minor effects on the denatured state. Theoretical calculations, based on an off-lattice model and hard-sphere particles, are in good agreement with the in vitro data. The simulations demonstrate that, in the presence of 25% volume occupancy of spheres, native flavodoxin is thermally stabilized, and the free energy landscape shifts to favor more compact structures in both native and denatured states. The difference contact map reveals that the native-state compaction originates in stronger interactions between the helices and the central beta-sheet, as well as by less fraying in the terminal helices. This study demonstrates that macromolecular crowding has structural effects on the folded ensemble of polypeptides.",

The thermal transitions are irreversible at high buffer concentrations at all pH values studied, although they are reversible between pH 3.5 and 5.4 at low buffer concentrations. The denaturation enthalpy, DeltaH(Tm), at denaturation temperature Tm was a function of both Tm and the buffer concentration, and this resulted in heat capacity changes decreasing with buffer concentration. When the denaturation enthalpies were corrected for Tm dependence, they did not appear to change versus pH. The denaturation entropies, however, appeared to decrease with pH, leading to a small but appreciable increase in the stability of the protein with pH. The difference between the number of moles of protons stoichiometrically bound to a mole of protein in the native and thermally denatured state, was calculated from the variation of Tm versus pH at each buffer concentration. The values obtained appear to depend on pH alone rather than upon temperature or buffer concentration, a result which agrees with the invariance of the denaturation enthalpies with pH. This dependence was fitted to the titration curve of a group with a pK of 5.4.",

        "abstract": "We here compare thermal unfolding of the apo and holo forms of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans flavodoxin, which noncovalently binds a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor. In the case of the apo form, fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) detected transitions are reversible but do not overlap (T(m) of 50 and 60 degrees C, respectively, pH 7). The thermal transitions for the holo form follow the same pattern but occur at higher temperatures (T(m) of 60 and 67 degrees C for fluorescence and CD transitions, respectively, pH 7). The holoprotein transitions are also reversible and exhibit no protein concentration dependence (above 10 microM), indicating that the FMN remains bound to the polypeptide throughout. Global analysis shows that the thermal reactions for both apo and holo forms proceed via an equilibrium intermediate that has approximately 90% nativelike secondary structure and significant enthalpic stabilization relative to the unfolded states. Incubation of unfolded holoflavodoxin at high temperatures results in FMN dissociation. Rebinding of FMN at these conditions is nominal, and therefore, cooling of holoprotein heated to 95 degrees C follows the refolding pathway of the apo form. However, FMN readily rebinds to the apoprotein at lower temperatures. We conclude that (1) a three-state thermal unfolding behavior appears to be conserved among long- and short-chain, as well as apo and holo forms of, flavodoxins and (2) flavodoxin's thermal stability (in both native and intermediate states) is augmented by the presence of the FMN cofactor.",

On average, an inserted residue reduces the free energy of denaturation (delta GH2O) by an amount roughly comparable to an alanine or glycine substitution for one of the residues flanking the site of insertion. Several positions outside of the enzyme active site were found where insertions, but not substitutions, lead to structural changes that modify catalytic activity and the circular dichroism spectrum.

L., Otwinowski, Z., Gelb, M. H., & Sigler, P. B. (1990) Science 250, 1560-1563]. We now report the importance of these two residues in the structure and function of PLA2 in terms of aromaticity (changing to Ile) and hydrophobic (changing to Ala) and hydrophilic (changing to Tyr) character of these residues. The structural properties of the mutants were analyzed by proton NMR and by guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation. The functional properties were determined by measuring kinetic parameters toward various substrates in the forms of monomers, micelles, and vesicles, and by measuring equilibrium dissociation constants at the interface. The results show that (i) The conformational stability of each mutant was as good as that of wild-type PLA2; none of the mutants was significantly perturbed structurally as judged from detailed 1H NMR analysis. These results suggest that neither the Phe-22/Phe-106 face-to-face pair nor the Phe-22/Tyr-111 edge-to-face pair plays a significant structural role. (ii) Mutations to Ile at either position 22 or position 106 resulted in only minor perturbations in activity.

Equilibrium studies on the unfolding of prochymosin and pepsinogen by urea were carried out at pH 7.5 and pH 9.0. The results indicate that the stabilization energies of the two proteins are identical at pH 7.5, but that at pH 9.0 pepsinogen is significantly less stable than prochymosin. 3. Kinetic studies on the unfolding of prochymosin and pepsinogen indicate that the processes can be described by a single first-order rate constant, and that at any given value of denaturant concentration and pH the rate of unfolding of prochymosin is significantly greater than that of pepsinogen. 4. Unfolding of prochymosin by concentrated urea is not fully reversible, unlike that of pepsinogen. Kinetic analysis of the refolding of the proteins suggests the presence of a slow process following unfolding in urea; for pepsinogen this process leads to a slowly refolding form, whereas for prochymosin the slow process in urea leads to a form that cannot refold on dilution of the denaturant. 5. The results provide a rationale for an empirical process for recovery of recombinant prochymosin after solubilization of inclusion bodies in concentrated urea. 6.

        "abstract": "Human gammaD crystallin (HgammaD-Crys) is a two domain, beta-sheet eye lens protein that must remain soluble throughout life for lens transparency. Single amino acid substitutions of HgammaD-Crys are associated with juvenile-onset cataracts. Features of the interface between the two domains conserved among gamma-crystallins are a central six-residue hydrophobic cluster, and two pairs of interacting residues flanking the cluster. In HgammaD-Crys these pairs are Gln54/Gln143 and Arg79/Met147. We previously reported contributions of the hydrophobic cluster residues to protein stability. In this study alanine substitutions of the flanking residue pairs were constructed and analyzed. Equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments at 37 degrees C revealed a plateau in the unfolding/refolding transitions, suggesting population of a partially folded intermediate with a folded C-terminal domain (C-td) and unfolded N-terminal domain (N-td). The N-td was destabilized by substituting residues from both domains. In contrast, the C-td was not significantly affected by substitutions of either domain. Refolding rates of the N-td were significantly decreased for mutants of either domain. In contrast, refolding rates of the C-td were similar to wild type for mutants of either domain. Therefore, domain interface residues of the folded C-td probably nucleate refolding of the N-td. We suggest that these residues stabilize the native state by shielding the central hydrophobic cluster from solvent. Glutamine and methionine side chains are among the residues covalently damaged in aged and cataractous lenses. Such damage may generate partially unfolded, aggregation- prone conformations of HgammaD-Crys that could be significant in cataract.",

        "abstract": "Chemical denaturant sensitivity of the dimeric main protease from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to guanidinium chloride was examined in terms of fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifuge, and enzyme activity change. The dimeric enzyme dissociated at guanidinium chloride concentration of <0.4 M, at which the enzymatic activity loss showed close correlation with the subunit dissociation. Further increase in guanidinium chloride induced a reversible biphasic unfolding of the enzyme. The unfolding of the C-terminal domain-truncated enzyme, on the other hand, followed a monophasic unfolding curve. Different mutants of the full-length protease (W31 and W207/W218), with tryptophanyl residue(s) mutated to phenylalanine at the C-terminal or N-terminal domain, respectively, were constructed. Unfolding curves of these mutants were monophasic but corresponded to the first and second phases of the protease, respectively. The unfolding intermediate of the protease thus represented a folded C-terminal domain but an unfolded N-terminal domain, which is enzymatically inactive due to loss of regulatory properties. The various enzyme forms were characterized in terms of hydrophobicity and size-and-shape distributions. We provide direct evidence for the functional role of C-terminal domain in stabilization of the catalytic N-terminal domain of SARS coronavirus main protease.",

        "title": "Mutational analysis demonstrates that specific electrostatic interactions can play a key role in the denatured state ensemble of proteins.", 
        "abstract": "The nature of the denatured state ensemble has been controversial for decades owing, in large part, to the difficulty in characterizing the structure and energetics of denatured state interactions. There is increasing evidence for relatively non-specific hydrophobic clustering in the denatured states of some proteins but other types of interactions are much less well characterized. Here, we report the characterization of highly specific electrostatic interactions in the denatured state of a small alpha-beta protein, the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 (NTL9). Mutation of Lys12 to Met has been shown to increase the stability of NTL9 significantly through the disruption of denatured state interactions. Here, we describe the analysis of the pH-dependent stability of 13 mutants designed to probe the nature of the Lys12 denatured state interaction. Lys12 is located in a lysine-rich region of the protein but analysis of a set of Lys to Met mutants shows that it plays a unique role in the denatured state. Analysis of mutants of all of the acidic residues in NTL9 shows that Lys12 forms a specific non-native electrostatic interaction with Asp8 in the denatured state ensemble. Thus the distribution of charge-charge interactions in the denatured state ensemble of NTL9 appears to be biased by few key interactions and is very different from that expected in a random coil. We propose that these interactions are not encoded by local sequence effects but rather reflect interactions among residues more distant in sequence. These results demonstrate that electrostatic as well as hydrophobic interactions can play an important role in the denatured state ensemble.",

        "abstract": "In a previous study, the small protein staphylococcal nuclease was shown to readily accommodate single alanine and glycine insertions, with average losses in stability comparable to substitutions at the same sites (PROT. 7:299-305, 1990). To more fully explore this unexpected adaptability to changes in residue spacing, 2 double amino acid insertions (alanyl-glycine, glycyl-glycine) and 3 additional single amino acid insertions with dissimilar side chains (proline, leucine, and glutamine) were constructed at 10 of the sites previously studied. At 8 of these sites, the type of amino acid side chain on the inserted residue significantly influenced the stability of the mutant protein. However, at 9 of the 10 sites, the double insertions were found to be no more destabilizing than the single alanine or glycine insertions. In contrast, double substitution mutations of staphylococcal nuclease, which replace two adjacent residues with alanine, do not show this striking degree of non-additivity. A comparison of the effects of single glutamine and single glycine insertions with alanyl-glycine insertions indicates that insertion of alanine into the peptide backbone is, on average, less destabilizing than appending the equivalent atoms onto the side chain of a glycine insertion. To explain their very different energetic effects, we propose that, unlike most substitutions, the inserted residue(s) must induce lateral displacements of the polypeptide chain, forcing the folded conformation away from that of wild type. The resulting obligatory shifts in the positioning of residues flanking the insertion generate a large number of degrees of freedom around which the mutant structure can relax.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Predictions of tertiary structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences are facilitated greatly when the structures of homologous proteins are known. On this basis, structural features of Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase) were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis experiments based on the known tertiary structure of the catalytic (c) chain of E. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase). In ATCase, each c chain is composed of two globular domains connected by two interdomain helices, one of which is near the C-terminus and is critical for the in vivo folding of the chains and their assembly into trimers. Each active site is located at the interface between two chains and requires the participation of residues from each of the adjacent chains. OTCase, a trimeric enzyme, has been proposed to be similar in structure to the ATCase trimer on the basis of sequence identity (32%), the nature of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, and secondary structure predictions. As shown here, analysis of OTCase and ATCase sequences revealed extensive evolutionary conservation in portions corresponding to the ATCase active site and the C-terminal helix. Truncations and substitutions within the predicted C-terminal helix of OTCase had effects on activity and thermal stability strikingly similar to those caused by analogous alterations in ATCase. Similarly, substitutions at either of two conserved residues, Ser 55 and Lys 86, in the proposed active site of OTCase had deleterious effects parallel to those caused by the analogous ATCase substitutions. Hybrid trimers comprised of chains from both these relatively inactive OTCase mutants exhibited dramatically increased activity, as predicted for shared active sites located at the chain interfaces. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the tertiary and quaternary structures of the two enzymes are similar.",

The lower-temperature one corresponds to barstar denaturation and the higher-temperature transition to ribonuclease melting.

        "abstract": "A class of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of T4 lysozyme with reduced activity at 30 degrees C and no activity at 43 degrees C has been selected. These mutants, designated \"tight\" ts mutants, differ from most other T4 lysozyme mutants that are active at 43 degrees C, but only manifest their ts lesion by a reduced halo size around phage plaques after exposure of the growth plates to chloroform vapors. For example, in the series of T4 lysozyme mutants at position 157, the original randomly selected mutant, T1571, is the least stable of the series, yet, apart from the halo assay and subsequent in vitro protein stability measurements, this mutant is indistinguishable from wild type (WT) even at 43 degrees C. Two mutants were identified: L91P and L66P. Both insert proline residues into alpha-helical regions of the WT protein structure. The stabilities (delta delta G) as determined by urea denaturation are 8.2 kcal/mol for L91P and 7.1 kcal/mol for L66P. CD spectra indicate that no major conformational changes have occurred in the mutant structures. The structures of the mutants were modeled with a 40-ps molecular dynamics simulation using explicit solvent. For L91P, the reduction of stability appears to be due to an unsatisfied hydrogen bond in the alpha-helix and to a new buried cavity. For L66P, the reduction of stability appears to be due to a disruption of the interdomain alpha-helix, at least two unsatisfied hydrogen bonds, and a newly formed solvent-filled pocket that protrudes into the hydrophobic core, possibly reducing the stabilizing contribution of a partially buried intrachain salt bridge.",

        "abstract": "To test whether the combination of multiple thermostabilizing mutations is a useful strategy to generate a hyperstable mutant protein, five mutations, Gly23-->Ala, His62-->Pro, Val74-->Leu, Lys95-->Gly, and Asp134-->His or Asn, were simultaneously introduced into Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI. The enzymatic activities of the resultant quintuple mutant proteins, 5H- and 5N-RNases HI, which have His and Asn at position 134, respectively, were 35 and 55% of that of the wild-type protein. The far-UV and near-UV CD spectra of these mutant proteins were similar to those of the wild-type protein, suggesting that the mutations did not seriously affect the tertiary structure of the protein. The differences in the free energy change of unfolding between the wild-type and mutant proteins, delta delta G, were estimated by analyzing the thermal denaturation of the proteins by CD. The 5H-RNase HI protein, which was slightly more stable than the 5N-RNase HI, was more stable than the wild-type protein by 20.2 degrees C in Tm and 5.6 kcal/mol in delta G at pH 5.5. In addition, the 5H-RNase HI was highly resistant to proteolysis and acid denaturation. The effects of each mutation on the thermal stability and the susceptibility to chymotryptic digestion were nearly cumulative, and the 5H-RNase HI undergoes chymotryptic digestion at a rate that is 41 times slower than that of the wild-type protein. Good correlation was observed between the thermal stability and the resistance to chymotryptic digestion for all proteins examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The phasing established earlier for the dystrophin rod, as well as for Drosophila spectrin and smooth muscle alpha-actinin, suggested a length of less than 113 residues for the dystrophin repeat that we have chosen. Fragments with a common N-terminus and lengths between 113 and 119 residues were prepared. The formation of the stable native tertiary fold could be recognized by resistance to proteolysis, the circular dichroism spectrum in the regions of both peptide and aromatic absorption bands and the resolution of the long-wavelength component in the tryptophan absorption spectrum. It was found that the critical length for folding was 117 residues: shortening the chain by 1 further residue resulted in loss of the capacity to form a defined tertiary structure. Residue 117 is a glutamine; replacement of this by a methionine residue did not impair the ability of the chain to enter the folded conformation, implying that it is the length of the C-terminal alpha-helix, rather than any specific side-chain interaction, that is critical in determining the stability of the native structure. The fragment of 119 residues forms a significantly more stable structure than that of 117. It appears that the minimum unit capable of forming the native fold extends some residues into the adjoining sequence repeat.",

        "abstract": "The protein DsbA facilitates disulfide bond formation in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. It has only two cysteine residues that are separated in the sequence by two other residues and are shown to form a disulfide bond reversibly. Chemical modification studies demonstrate that only one of the cysteine residues has an accessible thiol group in the reduced protein. Equilibrium and kinetic characterization of thiol-disulfide exchange between DsbA and glutathione showed that the DsbA disulfide bond was 10(3)-fold more reactive than a normal protein disulfide. Similarly, the mixed disulfide between the accessible cysteine residue and glutathione was 10(4)-fold more reactive than normal. The overall equilibrium constant for DsbA disulfide bond formation from GSSG was only 8 x 10(-5) M. These properties indicate that disulfide-bonded DsbA is a potent oxidant and ideally suited for generating protein disulfide bonds. Disulfide bonds generally increase the stabilities of folded proteins, when the folded conformation reciprocally stabilizes the disulfide bonds. In contrast, the disulfide bond of DsbA was so unstable in the folded state that its stability increased by 4.5 +/- 0.1 kcal.mol-1 when the protein unfolded. This implies that the disulfide bond destabilizes the folded conformation of DsbA. This was confirmed by demonstrating that the reduced protein was 3.6 +/- 1.4 kcal.mol-1 more stable than that with the disulfide bond.",

        "abstract": "In the absence of its two disulfide bonds, ribonuclease T1 can exist in a native-like folded conformation when > or = 2 M NaCl is present. We measured the kinetics of unfolding and refolding of two reduced and carboxymethylated variants of ribonuclease T1 with one cis proline (the Ser54Gly/Pro55Asn variant) and with two cis prolines (the wild-type protein) as a function of the NaCl concentration. Single and double mixing techniques were used. Analysis of the kinetic results demonstrates that the two cis prolyl bonds at Pro39 and Pro55 remain cis in the folded state after the reduction and carboxymethylation of the disulfide bonds. Folded molecules with trans isomers could not be found. The substitution of cis-Pro55 influences the proline-limited folding reaction, and the analysis of the changes in the folding kinetics shows that the trans-->cis isomerizations of both prolines are slow and are rate-determining steps for the refolding of ribonuclease T1 in the presence as well as in the absence of the disulfide bonds. The direct folding reaction of protein chains with correct prolyl isomers is also affected by the Ser54Gly/Pro55Asn mutation. The rate of refolding is decreased, whereas the rate of unfolding is almost unaffected. The kinetic analysis points to two main consequences of the Ser54Gly/Pro55Asn mutation for the stability and the folding mechanism of RNase T1. It is moderately destabilizing, because the deletion of a conformationally restricted residue (Pro55-->Asn) and the insertion of a flexible residue (Ser54-->Gly) both tend to increase the entropy of the unfolded state. The cis<-->trans isomerization of Pro55 is abolished, however, leading to a decrease in the entropy of the unfolded protein. These two entropic contributions seem to partially compensate each other, and the net change in free energy as a consequence of the Ser54Gly/Pro55Asn double mutation is very small.",

        "abstract": "The destabilizing effect of electrostatic repulsions on protein stability has been studied by using synthetic two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coils as a model system. The native coiled-coil consists of two identical 35-residue polypeptide chains with a heptad repeat QgVaGbAcLdQeKf and a Cys residue at position 2 to allow formation of an interchain disulfide bridge. This peptide, designed to contain no intrahelical or interhelical electrostatic interactions, forms a stable coiled-coil structure at 20 degrees C in benign medium (50 mM KCl, 25 mM PO4, pH 7) with a [urea]1/2 value of 6.1 M. Four mutant coiled-coils were designed to contain one or two Glu substitutions for Gln per polypeptide chain. The resulting coiled-coils contained potential i to i' + 5 Glu-Glu interchain repulsions (denoted as peptide E2(15,20)), i to i' + 2 Glu-Glu interchain repulsions (denoted E2(20,22)), or no interchain ionic interactions (denoted E2(13,22) and E1(20)). The stabilities of the coiled-coils were determined by measuring the ellipticities at 222 nm as a function of urea or guanidine hydrochloride concentration at 20 degrees C in the presence and absence of an interchain disulfide bridge. At pH 7, in the presence of urea, the stabilities of E2(13,22) and E2(20,22) were identical suggesting that the potential i to i' + 2 interchain Glu-Glu repulsion in the E2(20,22) coiled-coil does not occur. In contrast, the mutant E2(15,20) is substantially less stable than E2(13,22) or E2(15,20) by 0.9 kcal/mol due to the presence of two i to i' + 5 interchain Glu-Glu repulsions, which destabilize the coiled-coil by 0.45 kcal/mol each. At pH 3 the coiled-coils were found to increase in stability as the number of Glu substitutions were increased. This, combined with reversed-phase HPLC results at pH 7 and pH 2, supports the conclusion that the protonated Glu side chains present at low pH are significantly more hydrophobic than Gln side chains which are in turn more hydrophobic than the ionized Glu side chains present at neutral pH. The protonated Glu residues increase the hydrophobicity of the coiled-coil interface leading to higher coiled-coil stability. The guanidine hydrochloride results at pH 7 show similar stabilities between the native and mutant coiled-coils indicating that guanidine hydrochloride masks electrostatic repulsions due to its ionic nature and that Glu and Gln in the e and g positions of the heptad repeat have very similar effects on coiled-coil stability in the presence of GdnHCl.",

        "abstract": "The stability of the folded conformation of ribonuclease T1 is increased by 0.8, 1.8, and 3.3 kcal/mol in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl, MgCl2, and Na2HPO4, respectively. This remarkable increase in the conformational stability results primarily from the preferential binding to the native protein of one Mg2+ or two Na+ ions at cation-binding sites and by the binding of one HPO4(2-) ion at an anion-binding site. Only modest binding constants, 6.2 (Na+), 155 (Mg2+), and 282 M-1 (HPO4(2-)), are required to account for the enhanced stability. One important goal of the modification of proteins through genetic engineering is to increase their stability. Our results suggest that the creation of specific cation- and anion-binding sites on the surface of a protein through amino acid substitutions might be a generally useful way of achieving this goal. The design of these sites will be aided by the recent availability of detailed structural information on cation- and anion-binding sites.",

        "title": "Contribution of buried lysine residues to the oligomerization specificity and stability of the fos coiled coil.", 
        "abstract": "Coiled coils comprise two or more helices characterized by a heptad repeat of amino acids denoted a through g. The buried a and d positions are usually occupied by hydrophobic residues. Fos dimerizes via a coiled coil (leucine zipper) with Jun family members to form the transcription factor AP-1. Fos homodimers are relatively unstable due to unfavorable interhelical electrostatic interactions within the Fos two-stranded coiled coil. The Fos coiled coil contains two polar position a Lys residues (Lys 16 and Lys 30 of Fos-p1, a peptide corresponding to the coiled-coil domain of v-Fos). Lys 16 and Lys 30 of Fos-p1 were replaced individually and together with the unnatural amino acid norleucine (2-aminohexanoic acid), which corresponds to a deletion of the Lys epsilon-amino group. The midpoint of thermal denaturation (T(m)) of Fos-p1 (10 microM) is 30 degrees C at pH 7. The Lys 16 --> Nle variant forms predominantly homodimers that are relatively unstable (T(m) = 46 degrees C). The Lys 30 --> Nle variant forms a stable homotetramer (T(m) = 60 degrees C). The Lys 16/Lys 30 --> Nle variant forms a very stable homotetramer (T(m) = 80 degrees C). The results show that (i) the effects of buried position a Lys residues on coiled-coil oligomerization are context dependent and (ii) electrostatic destabilization of the Fos homodimer can be mitigated by an oligomerization switch moderated by a single buried Lys residue.",

        "title": "Mapping the interactions present in the transition state for unfolding/folding of FKBP12.", 
        "abstract": "The structure of the transition state for folding/unfolding of the immunophilin FKBP12 has been characterised using a combination of protein engineering techniques, unfolding kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. A total of 34 mutations were made at sites throughout the protein to probe the extent of secondary and tertiary structure in the transition state. The transition state for folding is compact compared with the unfolded state, with an approximately 30 % increase in the native solvent-accessible surface area. All of the interactions are substantially weaker in the transition state, as probed by both experiment and molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast to some other proteins of this size, no element of structure is fully formed in the transition state; instead, the transition state is similar to that found for smaller, single-domain proteins, such as chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 and the SH3 domain from alpha-spectrin. For FKBP12, the central three strands of the beta-sheet, beta-strand 2, beta-strand 4 and beta-strand 5, comprise the most structured region of the transition state. In particular Val101, which is one of the most highly buried residues and located in the middle of the central beta-strand, makes approximately 60 % of its native interactions. The outer beta-strands and the ends of the central beta-strands are formed to a lesser degree. The short alpha-helix is largely unstructured in the transition state, as are the loops. The data are consistent with a nucleation-condensation model of folding, the nucleus of which is formed by side-chains within beta-strands 2, 4 and 5, and the C terminus of the alpha-helix. The precise residues involved in the nucleus differ in the two simulated transition state ensembles, but the interacting regions of the protein are conserved. These residues are distant in the primary sequence, demonstrating the importance of tertiary interactions in the transition state. The two independently derived transition state ensembles are structurally similar, which is consistent with a Bronsted analysis confirming that the transition state is an ensemble of states close in structure.",

        "title": "Folding pathway of FKBP12 and characterisation of the transition state.", 
        "abstract": "The folding pathway of human FKBP12, a 12 kDa FK506-binding protein (immunophilin), has been characterised. Unfolding and refolding rate constants have been determined over a wide range of denaturant concentrations and data are shown to fit to a two-state model of folding in which only the denatured and native states are significantly populated, even in the absence of denaturant. This simple model for folding, in which no intermediate states are significantly populated, is further supported from stopped-flow circular dichroism experiments in which no fast \"burst\" phases are observed. FKBP12, with 107 residues, is the largest protein to date which folds with simple two-state kinetics in water (kF=4 s(-1)at 25 degrees C). The topological crossing of two loops in FKBP12, a structural element suggested to cause kinetic traps during folding, seems to have little effect on the folding pathway. The transition state for folding has been characterised by a series of experiments on wild-type FKBP12. Information on the thermodynamic nature of, the solvent accessibility of, and secondary structure in, the transition state was obtained from experiments measuring the unfolding and refolding rate constants as a function of temperature, denaturant concentration and trifluoroethanol concentration. In addition, unfolding and refolding studies in the presence of ligand provided information on the structure of the ligand-binding pocket in the transition state. The data suggest a compact transition state relative to the unfolded state with some 70 % of the surface area buried. The ligand-binding site, which is formed mainly by two loops, is largely unstructured in the transition state. The trifluoroethanol experiments suggest that the alpha-helix may be formed in the transition state. These results are compared with results from protein engineering studies and molecular dynamics simulations (see the accompanying paper).",
